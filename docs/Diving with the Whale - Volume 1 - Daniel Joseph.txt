Foreword 
Dh·ing ,vith the Whale is a three part series on the 
intermediary teachings ofDaskalos and the Researchers of Truth. In 
this series we will dive more deeply into some of the most advanced 
teachings on God, Man and the Nature of Reality available anywhere. 
The information contained within these three volumes will 
add much meaning to any seeker's fundamental search for the truth 
of who they are what they are, where they have come from and what 
is the purpose of their life. We will also answer some of the deeper 
questions such as:  \X-'hat is Life?  \'X,'hat is Death? Where do we go 
after the change called Death? Do we have a Soul? What causes our 
Suffering? And most importantly: How can we reduce our Suffering 
and live a Happier Life? 
Today we often hear the terms "outer self" and "inner self"'; 
"Jower self and higher self".  But we do not have two selves! There is 
only one Self that extends from our Divine Nature as Spirit-Soul-Self 
to our Human Nature as a personality-self. As this Selfbood, we are 
on a marvelous journey traveling through the glorious but sometimes 
painful time, space and place worlds of existence. Upon the 
completion of these incamational journeys we assimilate with our 
Real Nature and God. 
God speed on your journey, 
Daniel Joseph - a  Researcher of Truth 

DEDICATION 
The search for truth concerning God, man and the 
nature of reality is perhaps the greatest undertaking one 
could ever engage in during their life.  It is   a calling of 
many, the duty of some but really it is an underlying 
necessity for all. 
The gentle persuasion to all is to: "Seek the truth and 
the truth will  set  you free," because the truth sets us free 
from our suffering, which is born from an i
gn
orance of the 
truth. It is with great pleasure I dedicate this book to my 
family, friends and to all seekers of truth worldwide.

Parallel Universes 
As a personality we live in the multilayered Worlds 
of Existences. The three Worlds of Existence are the 
Material, the Psychical and the Noetical Universes. These 
Universes are worlds of space, time and place. These 
worlds co-exist in parallel and are intermingled together but 
exist uniquely at different rates of vibration. The Material 
Universe is our Earth, our solar system, the Milky Way 
galaxy and all the other galaxies scattered throughout three­
dimensional space. The Material Universe and everything 
existing in it are under the conditions of both space and 
time. That is to say, it is under the concepts of measurable 
distance and the progressive sequence of events as 
delineated by clocks and calendars. 
However, there are different laws governing each of 
the three Worlds of Existence. Laws of Physics (such as 
gravity, inertia, cohesion, etc.) regulate matter and our 

physical life on Earth. We learn about the laws of the 
material world and how to live in harmony with them in 
childhood. However, we are not only inhabitants of the 
material world. We are also simultaneously citizens of the 
Psychical and the Noetical  Universes. We have a Psychical· 
and a Noetical body corresponding to these worlds that 
coexists within and around our material body. The average 
person is not aware of their  Psychical and Noetical bodies 
yet they are using  them subconsciously in expressing 
emotions and thought. Most people are not aware of the 
Psychical  Planes of existence yet they subconsciously enter 
these worlds  every  night as their material body is sleeping 
in bed. After the death of the material body we, as 
personalities, continue our life in the Psychical and Noetical 
Universes. 
In the Psychical Universes, the spatial laws of the 
third dimension are obliterated. Space as the measurable 
distances of length,  width and height is simply non-existent 
in the Psychical  Universes. Also the sense of time changes 

in the Psychical Planes, but continues as meaning derived 
from a sequence of events. The Psychical and Noetical 
Planes are worlds of conditions that convey impressions 
that give us a sense of place. 
For decades, Daskalos described these other planes 
of existence and the laws governing them in detail. Decades 
ago he said that Science would eventually discover these 
other dimensions, prove their existence, and call them 
"Universes". Recently, many scientists approached this 
idea. Theoretical physicists from Stanford University 
recently published research on what they are calling Parallel 
Universes. They postulate these Universes co-exist 
simultaneously with the material universe. This is exactly 
what Daskalos and other mystics have always stated. 
Orthodox science tends to dismiss and even ridicule 
the findings of mystical research. Yet, mystics have always 
described realities that scientists later find with their own 
methods and eventually embrace as true. Mystics accurately 
described the body's circulation, and nervous systems many 

centuries before orthodox medical science discovered 
them. Mystics from the past wrote about and published 
diagrams of the atom with its nucleus and orbiting 
electrons many years before orthodox science officially 
"discovered" the atom. So we can take some direction from 
what true mystics have reported in the past to what 
scientists will find and verify in the future. 
Many adepts in the past and today experienced these 
higher planes of existence in these parallel universes. The 
psychical counterpart of Earth is within, and extends 
thousands of miles around the Earth. This means the 
psychical counterpart of Earth does not touch the psychical 
counterparts of other planets. During an out-of-body 
experience or after the change called death we pass into the 
Psychical counterpart of Earth. No one who passes over 
after the death of the material body leaves the planet. They 
simply enter into the Psychical equivalent of Earth and 
continue on with their life. Daskalos often declared, "No 
human being with his ps
y
chical body can leave the ps
y
chic 

counterpart of the planet. That is definite. If they say that 
they have gone to other planets or they are coming from 
the other planets in their psychical body, they are in 
illusion, they are mistaken!" 
After the "second death" we will find ourselves in 
the Noetical Planes living in our Noetical Body. Just as the 
Psychical counterpart is in and around the planet; so too, 
the fifth-dimensional Noetical counterpart is in and around 
our planet. However, it extends much farther beyond the 
Earth than the Psychical counterpart. Earth, along with our 
entire solar system with its sun   and the other planets are 
suspended within this vast Noetical Universe. Travel from 
the Noetical counterpart of Earth to the Noetical 
counterpart of another planet in our solar system is 
possible in minutes of time as measured on Earth. 
Daskalos explained this as   the method used by Extra­
Terrestrial Intelligences when they travel and that is why 
time and distance isn't a limitation to them when traveling. 

Time loses its meaning in the Noetical Worlds as we 
come to the edge of the Worlds of Existence and approach 
the threshold to the Eternal Now. A person passing from 
the radiant Psychical counterpart to the more luminous 
Noetical counterpart of our planet will see the same 
landscapes - mountains, forests, seas and so on. However, 
the luminosity of the light is so much greater in the 
Noetical counterpart. This light emanates, not from a single 
source or artificial means, but from within every atom of 
Noetical substance just as psychical light emanates from 
within every atom of psychical substance. 
Death of our material does not obliterate our 
personality in the Psychical and Noetical Universes. After 
"passing over,
,
, we will continue our existence in these 
higher worlds with the same desires, the same way of 
feeling and thinking. Simply leaving his or her material 
body in the change we call death enlightens no one. After 
passing over we will find ourselves in our Psychical body 
and Noetical body; taken together we call them the psycho-

noetical body. For a material body to be living it must also 
haYe a Psychical counterpart and a Noetical counterpart. In 
order for the Psychical Body to live it must have its 
Noetical counterpart but does not need a material 
counterpart. Passing over to the Noetical counterpart after 
the second death, we continue living in our Noetical Body, 
which does not need a Physical or material counterpart to 
exist. 
Our psycho-noetical body has the appearance of 
our material body. This is because the characteristics of our 
material body are in our psycho-noetical body. Those who 
enter the Psychical Universes will generally notice that in 
time the recently departed appear younger and more 
beautiful. This is because most people prefer to look young 
and beautiful. And this reveals something important about 
the narure of Psychic and Noetical substance. It means the 
psycho-noetical substance composing our bodies is much 
more malleable; and more under the control of our desires 
and will.Just think about this point. We can remain in the 
10 

universes in this youthful condition for a very long time, 
but not forever. 
These corresponding universes exist in parallel with 
one another at different dimensions and separated only by 
their specific frequencies of vibrations. We all have a 
working understanding of space within the third dimension 
in terms of width, length and height. The entire material 
universe and everything in it is of the third dimension. The 
first dimension, however, is a theoretical point: no width, 
no length and no height and no motion. The second 
dimension is also theoretical with width and length but no 
height and  still no motion. The  rwo dimensions can give 
certain representations of three-dimensional things such as 
a drawing on the surface of paper does. The paper itself has 
width, length and height (thickness) so it is not rwo­
dimensional but three-dimensional. 
The fourth dimensional universe contains the 
Psychical Planes with all its 49 planes and sub-planes. As 
we are personality conscious only of our existence in the 
11 

three-dimensional universe, we find difficulty in 
understanding the fourth dimension. It is similar to the 
problem of an imaginary two-dimensional creature's 
inability to perceive the reality of a three-dimensional 
world. Let us imagine this two dimensional creature living 
in his flat plane of existence. He exists only in two 
dimensions so he only understands width and length but 
not height. He has no frame of reference that will allow 
him to comprehend height. Now, what could this two 
dimensional creature understand about a being from the 
third dimension? Virtually nothing; even if it stood right 
next to him on his flat plane of existence! He simply could 
not understand this three-dimensional being with his two 
dimensional means. This is similar to our problem of 
detecting and understanding the fourth dimension or the 
beings living within it. As long as we only use our three 
dimensional senses we can only perceive the three 
dimensional universe. 
12 

In the fourth dimension, the third-dimension 
experience of space gives way to the experience of place. 
Place here is determined by rates of vibration. In the third 
dimension, no two objects can occupy the same location. 
In the fourth dimension, many objects can exists in the 
same location without  mixing up. The Esoteric Practices of 
our system  teach us how to raise and lower our vibrations 
and  attune to different frequencies. These exercises provide 
us with the means for conscious "movement" within the 
higher dimensional universes. 
The three Worlds of Existence are worlds of living 
forms. The fifth-dimensional Noetical World is where the 
laws,  causes, principles and ideas of the Noetic State are 
first expressed as bodily  forms. The forms on earth are but 
nicely shaped reflections of the bodily forms originating in 
the Noetical Planes. Every form existing in the material 
universe exists in the Psychical and Noetical universes. 
Varying  degrees of luminosity of the Divine Light is the 
most  obvious  difference between the various planes and 
13 

sub-planes of the fourth and fifth dimensions. Even in the 
lowest sub planes there is some light and light in any of the 
sub planes gives us a sense of satisfaction, wellbeing and 
understanding. 
On Earth our material body occupies space and 
moves primarily on the surface of the d
ry 
land. Laws such 
as gravity, cohesion and friction govern our movement in 
the three dimensional material universe. Other laws govern 
our "movement'' in the fourth-dimensional universe. 
Again, space does not exist in the fourth and fifth 
dimensions; it is a matter of place. In these universes, we 
"move" from one place to another; but the movement does 
not occur over measurable distances of space. It is the 
change in our vibration that automatically moves us and 
places us in localities of the psycho-noetical planes that we 
vibrate in harmony with. Here we are free to "move" 
within the range of planes and sub-planes that correspond 
with our own vibrations. In the Psychical Universes, our 
vibration matches the quality of our emotions and desires. 
14 

The fourth-dimensional Psychical Universes are worlds of 
vibration giving the sensation of feelings and emotions. 
Therefore, if we harbor hatred, anger, cruelty or other 
lower emotions; this will  limit how high we can move 
within the Psychical Universes. 
One of the first tasks of a Researcher of Truth is to 
master his emotional vibrations, noetically and with reason. 
Once accomplished, the researcher then can move about in 
these higher universes more freely. So, during an out-of­
body experience or after the death of the material body the 
Psychical location we find ourselves in is completely 
dependent on the quality of the emotions, desires and 
motivations we have been harboring and expressing on 
Earth. It is the same with the Noetical Universes; where 
we find ourselves is completely dependent on the quality of 
our thoughts and intensions we express. 
We are not our thoughts or our emotions, but we 
have  been  formulating our thoughts and emotions using 
the Mind. So our thoughts and emotions are ours, they are 
15 

not us but we are responsible for them. This is to say; we 
are not our noetical body, psychical body or our material 
body but we are accountable for them. As we study we 
learn to control and use our material body by means of its 
etheric double and our real will power. 
We study and learn to master uur emotional body, 
which often is troubling and even torturing us and the 
others around us. We have to control our emotions, 
desires and motivations using the Mind as thought; then we 
discover our emotions are our expressions but we are not 
our emotions because we can change and control them. 
Likewise, we are not our thoughts but often we have 
been misusing our thoughts in serving emotion-desire rype 
elementals enslaving our self to them. We have to study in 
order to understand that by this very process we are 
shaping our personality with the elementals we are creating 
all the time. Now we come to the clear understanding that 
we have created our own personality, which has a kind of 
duality. At the heart of it is the Soul, but its expressions are 
16 

the thought 
and emotion 
elementals. 
This means 
we are 
Divine 
in nature 
but human 
in expression 
and in changing 
the quality 
of our expressions 
for the better, 
we 
automatically 
improve 
our psychical and 
noetical 
nature 
and thus our place 
in the Kingdom 
of the Heavens, 
in the 
Psychical 
and Noetical 
Universes. 
To enter 
the Kingdom of 
the Heavens, 
which 
is in 
our nature 
as a Spirit-Soul, 
we have to pass through our 
own sub-consciousness. 
With Introspection 
and 
Observation 
you might 
find your sub-consciousness 
to be 
mixed 
with unclean 
emotions, 
desires 
and thoughts, 
making 
parts of it like a foul smelling 
swamp. 
This is all created 
by 
passions, weaknesses, 
jealousies, 
hatreds, 
fears and self­
pities. 
So to reach the higher 
planes 
of the Kingdom 
of the 
Heavens 
within 
us, we need to overcome 
and clean all 
these 
undesirable 
things. 
This takes 
a sincere 
effort 
m·er time to understand 
what the Mind 
is and specifically 
how we are using 
to 
create 
elementals 
that  end 
up composing 
our sub-
17 

consciousness. We start to see the relationship  between 
our thoughts and our emotional desires and then 
emancipate our thinking mind from it servitude to the 
baser emotions and desires. This frees and strengthens us 
to be able to control negative emotions and transform 
tbem to positive. 
The outcome of creating and empowering  negative 
thoughts and emotions is a little like mixing the element of 
water and the element of Earth. If you mix pure water and 
pure earth you make mud which often has an unpleasant 
odor but, if  you add the element of fire, the heat from tbe 
fire will cause the water to evaporate, transforming it to 
pure water vapor, the mud will return to pure eartb and tbe 
smell goes away. Similarly our uncontrolled lower desires, 
thoughts and emotions are making a kind of smelly mud in 
our sub-consciousness, but, when making a good  prayer we 
are filling the prayer with the fire of Spirit and tbe heat 
from that prayer will purify that bad smelling mud in our 
sub-consciousness. Now it is safer and easier to pass 
18 

through our sub-consciousness and reach the higher 
dimensions in the Kingdom of the Heavens. 
What about the bad smelling muddy sub­
consciousness of others, what should we do? We should 
love  them,  because our love can dissolve in other people 
that  which is not good. If we rruly love them we might get 
to see what the miracle of love of love can do. Let's say 
we have someone we care  about  that has a muddy sub­
consciousness infected with  worms.   Again, a muddy sub­
consciousness represents a condition of negativity and 
dissatisfaction; while the worms represent specific 
unhealthy feelings and thoughts. If you had a physical 
worm infested, stinky  mud, and you put it I the sun; the 
sunlight will dry up mud making it pure water vapor and 
pure earth again. The sunlight will  kill the worms  because 
worms, just  like negative unhealthy feelings and thoughts, 
cannot stand the light and they will die. Our sincere love 
reflected on others is like a sun that helps dissolves what is 
19 

antagonistic in them.  It is our obligation in life, that we 
reflect love on to others for this purpose. 
Once we purify our sub-consciousness, we can more 
easily reach the other side. We, then, are in a world of the 
fourth dimension. It is the world of emotions and desires 
that one day we will all cross over to and live in and yet we 
are already visiting this world at night when we sleep, but 
we do so subconsciously. So our   mobility to and from this 
parallel universe, as well as our movement within it is not 
under our conscious control yet.  To make that movement 
consciously means we have to develop the personality from 
its mostly subconscious living to that of self-conscious 
living.  This means a real awakening and this will take effort 
over time using the methods of Introspection, 
Observation, Meditation, Concentration and Visualization. 
What makes this harder than it needs to be, is that all 
the time through our five senses we are focused outside us 
and this is all we know of life.  There are other universes 
coexisting in parallel, but at a higher vibratory rate. These 
20 

universes are much richer, more plentiful that anything we 
have ever known on Earth. 
On Earth we are only living on pans of the dry land 
that is divided into continents and countries, the other two 
thirds is water. What is it  like beyond Earth in the 
Psychical Planes? As we said the Psychical Planes contains 
the entire planet and thousands of miles beyond the planet. 
Here we live in localities in the sub planes we are in 
harmony with.  This dimension is a much Yaster world than 
what we know of the surface of the earth, which is very 
small by comparison. Because the fourth dimension is 
composed of place and not space. If one is trained he or 
she can move freely through place localities in these radiant 
Psychical Planes of existence. 
All this multi-layering in the Psychical world gives us 
a vast range of relative realities with hells and paradises. 
Who is creating these hells and paradises? God and his 
Archangels created the Psychical world as a lovely place, a 
real paradise. What turns their work into a hell? We do, 
21 

through our own ignorance. We build our conditional shell­
hells with our lower emotions and desires by the way we 
live.  This means that as place the Psychical World has been 
created as a paradise, but the way we are living and 
understanding life there can be filled with negative 
emotions and thoughts making this paradise a hell. And 
isn't that what we are doing on earth in certain localities. 
Look at the massive drug and crime ridden slum of Brazil 
called the City of God. Look at the gang invested 
neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles. Needle Park 
in Zurich, Switzerland in the 1990s became a mecca for 
European drug addicts. All some point in the past these 
were all beautiful localities, earthly paradises but were 
turned into hell holes by the behaviors of human beings. 
The same thing is happening in the psychical planes which 
have many hells also created by the negative expressions of 
human beings. Of course, there are also paradises there, 
which are created by the positive expressions of human 
beings. 
22 

So where we go at night during sleep and after the 
change called death corresponds exactly to the level of our 
emotions and desires. This means that most people living 
in the Psychical Universes are living in their own personal 
shell,  which can be heavenly, hellish or a bit of both. 
Unfortunately, they do not notice the real beauty of the 
psychical  world around them but only the shell they have 
created for themselves. This is the way that most people 
are living on Earth too. 
As we have said before, one of the works of the 
Invisible Helpers is to help people come out of the self­
imposed shell hells. But how many people really want to 
leave their shell hells? Not many because they often 
consider this hell a paradise. There are no boundaries 
between the hells and paradises. Again, this is just like it is 
on  Earth, hells and  paradises are  not designated localities, 
they are created by the disposition of personalities. 
Something happened on Cyprus once that clearly 
demonstrated this fact. One of the most beautiful places 
23 

on Cyprus is up in the Trodos Mountains. It is wonderful 
there, with lovely sunlight filtering through pine forests, 
running streams of clear water and cool breezes. It is a 
natural paradise. Also a fine old-style Cypriot hotel is there 
and one time a very, very rich man was staying there. He 
was not satisfied with his life or anything in his life. He 
was known for quarreling with peoplP end he went to this 
hotel for relief, but found only despair. In the room next 
to the rich man, was an acquaintance of Daskalos, a 
common working man. This fellow was not rich at all and 
had to work hard all year long and save up just to afford to 
stay in that hotel for one week. 
On the first morning of his stay that worker opened 
the window of his hotel room and breathed in the fresh 
mountain air and listened to the running stream. He made 
a prayer of his own saying, "Thank you God, being in 
nature is so good - it is a paradise." This kind of simple 
prayer of gratitude is accepted by God more readily than 
24 

the ones we repeat mechanically. The worker was just 
making this prayer with a full heart. 
He was feeling so happy and satisfied with his life. 
Then, from the room next door, a gunshot rang out. In 
the other room the rich, but torrured, fellow committed 
suicide. He was so rich he could have lived in this lovely 
hotel in the mountains for years, but he could not see the 
beauty of the paradise that was all around him. He could 
not see the satisfaction of life.  Now just think about this. 
Both these people were in exactly the same environment. 
One was in his hell the other in his paradise. So it is not 
the location we are in, but it is the psychological condition 
we are in that makes a hell or paradise for us. 
These are challenges the Invisible Helpers face when 
trying to aid others in the Psychical Planes. There they find 
people living in their self-created shell. For example, take 
the life of an alcoholic person, when they pass over they do 
not automatically change and  lose  their desire for drinking 
alcohol. Simply passing over enlightens no one.  Their 
25 

personality remains just as it was before passing over. 
Now, when trying to help someone come out of their 
personally shell hell, the Invisible Helpers take them to a 
much, much better place, to a what others would call a real 
paradise. 
Often this just disrurbs them and they want to 
immediately go back to the shell they know and feel 
comfortable in.  We say all the time that no God or 
Archangel is keeping anyone in a shell hell if he or she 
decides to leave it.  Likewise, no one can make someone 
leave their shell hell if they choose to stay in it. 
God definitely does not punish and by narure cannot 
punish. God is omnipresent, equally present everywhere 
and in all. So if God really punished he would be a self­
punishing God - a   supreme masochist. God is not 
masochistic; God is unconditional love and mercy. 
To become skilled travelers in the higher dimension, 
we have to srudy and practice. We srudy and practice and 
soon realize that the Mind is everywhere as formless Super-
26 

Substance and it has been formulated into Noetical 
Substance, Psychical Substance, and Ethereal Substance. 
At its lowest rate of vibration, Mind is materialized as 
physical substance. We all know what is solid by  touching 
it with our hand,  which also is a solid. So we understand 
what is solid by touching it with something like our hand 
that is vibrating at the same  level of frequency as a solid 
object. If we were to try and touch a material rock with 
our psychical hand, the psychical hand would pass right 
through it, because the psychical hand and the material 
rock vibrate a much different  frequencies. If we could try 
and touch a psychical rock with our physical hand, the 
hand would pass  right through it, because the material hand 
and  the psychical rock vibrate at many different 
frequencies. 
In ancient Greece, Plato was teaching all this and to 
give meaning to his teaching about the higher dimensions 
he  gave  this analogy. He said to consider the material 
world has a vibrational frequency from one to ten. The 
27 

number one would represent the hardest and the number 
two would be something not quite as hard. The number 
five would represent water and the number nine would be 
representative of air and gases and things like fire and ether 
would correspond to the number ten. The scale of one to 
ten represents the different degrees of density of matter in 
the three dimensional universe. 
The Psychical Planes of the fourth dimension are 
also composed of Mind but they are vibrating at a higher 
frequency of eleven to twenty. So what is very, very hard 
on earth that corresponds to the number one also exists in 
the Psychical Planes corresponding to the number eleven. 
At this higher dimension we still have the sol.ids, liquids, 
gases, fire, and ether; all vibrating at a scale of eleven to 
twenty. Just as our material body vibrates at the one to ten 
rate of the material world it inhabits, our psychical body 
vibrates at the rate of eleven to twenty of the Psychical 
Worlds it inhabits. 
28 

Minds vibrating at a still higher octave of twenty-one 
to thirty apply to the fifth dimensional Noetical World of 
Existence. The densest Noetical Substance corresponds to 
the number twenty-one and the lightest Noetical Substance 
corresponding to Noetical ether having the number thirty. 
Everything existing in these three worlds of existence, 
including our bodies is Mind, manifesting at different 
frequencies of vibration. It is according to the relationship 
of the different frequencies that any substance in any of the 
universes is manifested as a solid,  liquid, gas, fire or ether. 
A mystic who can self-consciously raise his 
vibrations to the frequencies of the fifth dimension will be 
composed in his or her Noetical body in the Noetical 
counterpart of Earth. There a mystic or a researcher of 
truth  will  see  more light, abundant light and everything will 
look much better than on the material planet and if that 
mystic knows the  way, he or she can lower their ,�brations 
to the relative state of the psychical frequencies and then 
they will enter the psychical planes of the planet. In 
29 

Plato's 
analogy
, this mystic 
would 
be lowering 
their 
,·ibrations 
from the noetical 
scale of twenty-one 
to thirty to 
the psychical 
scale of eleven 
to twenty. 
If they knew the 
way, they 
could further 
lower their vibrations 
down 
to the 
material 
scale of one to ten and literally 
materialize 
a 
physical 
body on the planet. 
Likewise, 
a mystic 
who knows 
the way, can raise his vibrations 
of his body from the 
material 
scale of one to ten to that of the psychical 
scale of 
eleven 
to twenty 
and literally 
dematerialize 
their physical 
body and compose 
his or her self in their psychically 
body. 
A number 
of mystics 
have demonstrated 
this. 
Travel 
in and between 
the three Worlds 
of Existence 
is all about attuning 
to the frequencies 
of the place you are 
wish to be.  By changing your 
vibrations 
you change your 
place 
in these various 
dimensions, 
which 
are composed 
of 
solids, liquids, 
fire and ether. 
These 
are the prime 
elements 
and they along with 
a few other elements 
compose 
the 
three 
worlds 
of existence 
- the material, 
the psychical 
and 
the noetical.

The logical question comes: How can I reach that 
state of development? There are certain kinds of meditation 
exercises that will slowly,  slowly help us awaken and reach 
that  point.  But  this  skill is not like learning a trade, which 
can be done in a few years. This takes long and dedicated 
training. 
One time in an Inner Circle class a member asked 
Daskalos how long we must practice in order to reach these 
high levels. "Centuries" was  his reply. He said he had 
worked to develop these abilities and he is showing us the 
way but we must be the  ones to work on it and develop our 
latent abilities to this high level. 
There is a huge gain in this work above and beyond 
developing the ability to self-consciously travel in these 
higher dimensions. The real gain of this work is that you 
are  also developing your personality self-consciousness to 
that of the real Self-Consciousness of your  Inner Self. 
This development  continues until you reach your Inner 
Most Self, which is your eternal Spirit-Being Self. This Self 
31 

is brilliant beyond imagination, pure, powerful and 
immortal. So we change from a mostly instinctual, 
subconscious personality to a self-conscious personalit
y 
reaching our true individuality. Now the Soul is expressing 
itself through your purified personality. 
We can move from the Material Universe to the 
parallel Psychical and Noetical Universes �nd back again 
through the so-called gates to the light. These are the 
centers of energy in our etheric double known as Chakras. 
All these centers of energy are in all three bodies; and yet 
the center in the solar plexus more associated with our 
material body and serves as a door to the Psychical. The 
heart center is more associated with our Psychical Body 
and serves as a door to the Noetical. The head center is 
more associated with the Noetical Body and serves as a 
door to the Noetical. However, we should be clean in our, 
sub-consciousness, heart and mind before trying to pass 
through these gates. Our heart, mind and body must be 
calm and balanced in order to make this passage. This is 
32 

accomplished through Introspection, Meditation and 
Concenttation  exercises. 
In the next lesson we will learn about what it means 
to awaken spiritually and raise our consciousness to higher 
and higher  levels leading to Self-Super-Consciousness. 
33 

Questions 
Q. Ever since I've dedicated myself to bettering myself 
and developing my spirituality I've found a peace and 
contentment I haven't had since my childhood and the 
more I keep learning and applying the more that feeling 
seems to grow, and I can tell the effects it has on the 
people close to me. So with this in mind I was wondering 
if  all of this will be lost in my next incarnation or will it be 
maintained somehow? 
A. What we truly learn in a lifetime is  recorded on the 
permanent atom held by the Inner Self, which is like a 
book we are writing all the time. Lessons learned fully are 
recorded on this permanent atom and transferred to the 
Permanent Personality - that aspect of the soul, which 
expresses itself in the various incarnations. There are three 
permanent atoms which are as one in the Permanent 
Personality. And all this information is accessible to the 
34 

purified Present-Day personality when they raise their 
consciousness high enough. 
So when we begin a new incarnation we already have the 
recorded the lessons learned and  completed and the ones 
we still have to complete in the permanent personality. Still 
it is up to the newly incarnated present day personality to 
access the previously learned knowledge consciously. This 
is what Christ was alluding to in his parable about  the 
Lawyer/Learner. If the present day personality does not 
consciously tap into the previously recorded knowledge, 
this still manifests as latent talents, predispositions and 
tendencies. Your interest and eagerness to engage in  these 
practices in this  lifetime is simply a continuation of work 
you have  done along this line in previous incarnations. 
Nothing is ever lost. 
35 

Q. \X"ere all Souls created at the same time?  Is there a fixed 
number of souls incarnating, dis-incarnating and 
reincarnating? Or are more Souls being created on 
continual basis? 
A.  God said, "Let us create man [a human being] to our 
image and likeness." He did not say let ... s  create Souls. No 
Soul has ever been created; a Soul is a god.  We can say that 
the Soul is formed the moment the Spirit Ray of the Holy 
:\1onadic Self passes through the Human Idea Archetype. 
In that moment, which is eternal, the Soul was formed but 
not created. This is because the form of the Soul -the 
Human Idea always was and will be in us as an Eternal 
Spirit Being. As Spirit we always were, and are now, in the 
:\lultiplicity of Absolute Beingness - God.  Absolute 
Beingness is composed of a Multiplicity of Eternal Spirit 
Beings that has never been created and will ne,·er come to 
an end.  \Xnat had been created are the trees, animals and 
human beings.  Souls do not get created. 
36 

In the Bible it says, "Increase and multipl�'', which means 
to increase and multiply as incamared men and women, not 
as souls:  A Soul is Dh-ine and nothing Dh-ine has e,-er 
been created. Nau- the Soul ,ia the Permanent Personalicy 
projects a radiation, just a ray of itself into the worlds of 
existence and dons the mask of a personality. But rhis is 
not where projection stans. It really stans from the Holy 
;\lonadic Self, from the Spirit Being Self and its projected 
ray of Llfe-Llght passes through the Human Idea forming, 
the Soul-Self. As a Spirit-Soul-Self, we are not creations, 
but pan of the Absolute Beingness in Its ;\lultiplicit
y
. 
To Adam, or I should say to the Adams, the chance was 
given that souls could enter the material world through 
them and be born as men and women. Souls are ne,-er 
created and will ne,·er die; they are always pure. They are 
forever free and never bound. So it is a misnomer to say 
new souls, old souls, e,-ils souls or lost souls. 
37 

However personalities and material bodies have been 
created - But nothing else. If we think about this, we see 
our human body and tend to think the Inner Self is within 
me, thinking that "me" means my material body. But that 
within "me" is not the material body because as Souls we 
are not confined to a body of matter or e• .. en the higher 
psychical or noetical bodies. 
38 

Meditation 
Relax yourself completely. Start from the feet, the toes of 
your feet. Relax completely. 
This moment the Holy Archangels of the Elements are 
working with this material body of mine. What is the 
circulation of the blood? Whether you know it or not the 
blood is circulating in all of the material body. The etheric 
double in your material body, of your material body, is 
functioning now in making the material body, every organ 
of it, every part of it, every blood cell, and every molecule 
alive and well charged with energy. 
The Lord of Llght and Fire, Michael, is making your blood 
warm. Gabriel, the Lord of the Liquids, cooperating, is 
composing the blood cells.  Raphael, the Lord of Electricity 
and Magnetism (and other forces), are ,�talizing the blood 
cells, the organs, and the whole body, with that 
electromagnetic energy. And, Uriel, in your material body, 
39 

is balancing this creative work of the Archangels keeping 
the organs and the body in good order, provided that your 
Present-Day-Personality is not interfering wasting this 
vitality or energy by the way it is living, thinking, moving 
about. Expressing weaknesses, hatred, jealousy, and enmity 
are burning the etheric vitality needed by the Holy 
Archangels to keep in health and in good order all the 
organs of your body. This moment you are living in the 
material body, the Holy Spirit and the Archangels are 
working for you. Think: what is the circulation of the 
blood? Think: what are anabolism, catabolism and 
metabolism, which means, building up, dissolving and 
keeping the balance in the body. 
By studying this functioning in the body you will know the 
Total Wisdom and the Almightiness of the God. The Total 
Wisdom is in your material body, provided you don't 
interfere, hindering this great work of your brothers the 
Archangels. And with practice over time you will come in 
40 

self-conscious touch with these Archangels. First you'll 
come in touch with your Guardian Angel with whom you 
are talking all the time without knowing it. He knows 
everything about vou, though you know nothing about 
him. He is in you, unified with you. 
Concentrate in your relaxed body. Feel the aesthetic ether. 
Calm down all emotions and thoughts. Feel that you are in 
your body, calm and quiet. Try to find who you are

There 
once 
was 
a great 
King 
who 
ruled 
his 
Kingdom 
with 
wisdom and 
love. 
The 
King 
lived 
in 
a beautiful palace. 
There 
were 
many 
workers 
in 
that 
palace 
that 
served 
the 
King 
and 
helped run 
the 
kingdom. 
Also 
living 
in 
the 
palace 
was 
the 
King's 
beloved 
son, 
the 
Prince. 
The 
young 
Prince 
never 
lacked 
anything. 
He 
had 
the 
best 
garments, 
food 
and 
all 
the 
comforts 
the 
good 
King 
could 
provide. 
The 
workers 
in 
the 
palace also loved 
the 
Prince 
and 
lovingly 
served 
all 
of 
his 
need. 
One 
day, 
the 
young 
Prince 
was 
looking 
out 
the 
palace 
window 
when 
he 
saw 
a beggar. 
The 
Prince  called 
one 
of 
the 
palace 
workers 
and 
asked 
about 
the 
decrepit 
man. 
The 
worker 
explained 
that 
not 
all 
the 
people 
in 
his 
father's kingdom 
had 
enough 
food 
or 
money 
and 
therefore 
had 
to 
beg 
in 
order 
to 
get 
the 
sustenance 
they 
needed. 
It 
saddened 
the 
Prince 
to 
think 
people 
in 
his 
father's 
42 

prosperous realm were hungry and had to resort to begging 
for food. This greatly disturbed his peace of mind. 
That night, after the Prince had fallen asleep, he had 
a horrible nightmare. He dreamed he was a beggar with 
dirty, tattered clothes living homeless in the streets. He was 
starving and no one  would  give him food. The Prince 
tossed and turned in his bed repeatedly crying out loud, "I 
am poor! I am hungry! Please feed me!" Over and over he 
cried out until the workers in the King's palace heard and 
ran to help him. When they entered his bedroom the Prince 
was still in a  frightful  state and kept  crying out from his 
nightmarish dream  that he was a hungry beggar. The 
workers rushed to his bedside and all called  out, "wake up 
Prince!" 
In this allegory the good King represents God. The 
King's workers represent the Archangels that ser
v
e God 
and Humankind. The King's son, the Prince, represents 
human  beings, who are offspring of God but often 
slumbering in illusion. This is the state that humankind has 
43 

really fallen into, living their lives in the illusion of lack and 
separation. 
It makes no difference whether we are absorbed in 
our waking-dreams of unimportance or self-importance. 
Either way, we are mistakenly accepting our error-enriched 
notions as the true reality. So our duty as a human being is 
to awaken from shabby dreams of lack er self­
aggrandizement. How shall we awaken from these kinds of 
illusions, come to our senses and find the perfection of our 
true identity in genuine Self-Realization? This is the main 
task of a Researcher of Truth. We have a complete system 
for awakening in a safe, methodical way that anyone can 
engage themselves in and achieve real results in this 
lifetime. 
Let's take the story of the Prince. Did you notice 
how, in this story, the palace workers addressed the King's 
dreaming son by his true identity? They did not go to him 
and say, "wake up hungry beggar." Instead they called, 
"wake up Prince" to arouse him from the illusion that he 
44 

was a hungry beggar. The King's workers never lost sight 
of the Prince's true identity. Likewise, our Archangelic 
brothers have not lost sight of our true identities. They see 
and hold us in their constant meditation as we always have 
been, how we are now, and how we will always be: an 
offspring of the Almighty - true sons and daughters of our 
Divine Father. Yet it still remains our responsibility to 
make the effort to raise our consciousness from the 
slumbering states of sub-consciousness to higher levels of 
consciousness and come to this Realization. 
Christ's gentle persuasion to us all was, "be yea 
perfect, as perfect as your heavenly father - God." But is 
that really possible? Was this misquoted? Can we become 
as perfect as the Absolute Infinite intelligence we call God? 
No, but the point is that we, as a Spirit  Soul are perfect, as 
perfect as God our Heavenly Father. We as a Spirit Soul 
are not in need of becoming something we are not already. 
Rather we, as a personality, are in need of waking from our 
dreams of separation to realize that we as a Spirit Soul are 
45 

perfect, incorruptible, immortal and everlasting.  This is a 
great truth and one of the many mysteries we as a 
Researcher of Truth will unravel in the course of time. 
All of us at some point have felt that we are more 
than just a limited personality with a name, sex, nationality 
and a certain range of thoughts, feelings and behaviors. 
But to find what is beyond the limited consciousness of our 
personality we must first detangle our sense of self from 
our egoism, which is always changing, never satisfied and 
always looking outside itself for meaning and happiness. 
To do that we must use our real will power (And don't 
mistake real will power for the obstinacy of our 
personality). Our real will power is like our core strength 
and we must use it to engage ourselves in the practices of 
introspection, meditation, concentration, observation and 
visualization. These are not simple skills to develop. In 
fact, when properly developed, visualization is one of the 
greatest powers a human being can express. Developing 
46 

these 5  Golden Keys is the most safe and effective means a 
personality can use to awaken. 
In the course of time these practices will slowly 
awaken our personality in a safe and stable manner from 
sub-consciousness to alert waking-consciousness. Alert 
waking-consciousness has many degrees, which range from 
somewhat alert, more alert, even  more  alert until full Soul 
Self-Awareness is achieved. There aren't different  degrees 
of Soul Awareness. This  state is the Real Self-
Consciousness. Are there not higher states of 
consciousness? The very highest state of consciousness 
attainable by the human  beings is Self-Super­
Consciousness, which means one is able to know 
everything at any point, past or present. It also means 
being able to exist  and work perfectly in many places 
simultaneously. Daskalos  could, at will, enter the state of 
Self Super-Consciousness but could not permanently dwell 
in that  state  while  still  living in a material body on  earth. 
Precious few other  human  beings ha,·e been able to enter 
47 

this state while living on Earth - but there have been some. 
It is this state of Self Super-Consciousness that the all the 
archangelic orders enjoy, although, the Archangels sense of 
Self is not the same as the human beings. 
So, what can we expect from engaging in the 
teachings and practices of a Researcher of Truth? First, we 
come to the preliminary kind of s�tf-consciousness, which 
is simply becoming aware of our present-day personality 
self. This is not true Self-Consciousness, but it is a 
preliminary step. To know who we are as a personality and 
to discover our range of strengths and weaknesses through 
the process of introspection, observation and safe 
meditations. Not all meditations are safe or even effective. 
The personality is like an iceberg with only about 20 
percent of its mass visible, or conscious. There is another 
80 percent, which is not as visible and remains as what we 
call sub-consciousness. But the fully awakened individual (a 
master) has no sub-consciousness for he has made his sub­
consciousness conscious. 
48 

As we discover the causes of the weaknesses and 
afflictions of our personality through Introspection, we 
create steps to clean and correct these limitations. We will 
be successful in cleaning and thinning the veil that 
separates our personality from our Real Self and the radiant 
light of this Inner Self will shine through our personality 
self - brighter and brighter, illuminating our way and 
benefiting those around us. 
It is  at this stage in the process we discover 
something truly extraordinary. We begin to realize that this 
mysterious Inner Self of ours is able to change the 
undesirable expressions found in its personality. This 
means we discover the Self behind all these changeable 
expression of our temporary personality. We gradually 
awaken to the pre-existing truth that we are much more 
than the personality we create in this lifetime. Because we 
can examine, learn and are able to   transmute the lead in our 
heart to true gold in what the mystics call Alchemy. We 
discover the Self behind its phenomenal expressions in the 
49 

worlds of time, space and place. This is the great 
awakening. 
There are stories of people awakening in a single 
instant. But are those stories true? One of the most 
famous accounts is that of the Indian Saint Ramana 
Maharshi who lived from 1879 to 1950. His story is as 
follows. He was a 14-year-old high school student visiting 
his uncle and he begins to feel ill.  He goes to his room 
and, as he lies down, he begins to contemplate. He thinks, 
"I will either get better or I will die." He continues his train 
of thought, thinking about what will happen if he dies. He 
knows they will come for his dead body and take it to the 
burning Ghats for cremation. He continues with his 
contemplation, imagining his body is burnt to ashes. Then 
he raises the ultimate question: "Who am I without this 
body?" He furthers this "Who Am I" line of Self Inqui
ry 
going past his identification with his emotions and 
thoughts. Long story short, he soon comes to the 
realization that he is really the deathless S
p
irit; not in an 
50 

intellectual way, but in a full direct experience of the truth. 
He drops out of school, leaves his family and goes out 
teaching this "Who Am I" meditation. He  is one of the 
very  few masters from India I have ever heard of that teach 
a form of  Introspection. 
There was another 14-year-old boy from India that 
also  had a sudden "awakening." Later in his life, I came 
to know  this  "old  school" yogi - he was the real deal. He 
did not give discourses, write books or seek public 
attention. He taught only one concentric-type of 
meditation. And he never charged any money for his 
lessons. Yet, he was able to feed thousands upon 
thousands of poor and  homeless  people every Sunday 
through donations that were  freely given to him for this 
cause. 
His name was Shiva Bala Yogi. "Bala Yogi" means 
"
child" or "boy"  yogi. His sudden awakening happened in 
1949.  The boy had no spiritual background and lived in a 
remote village of poor weavers in Adivarapupeta, India. 
51 

At this time many in this village lived in small mud 
huts with thatched roofs. One day, he was swimming  with 
a group of his friends in a canal that ran by the village. 
After the swim, he got a Jackfruit from a tree nearby and 
began to eat it  when he had a vision of God. In this vision, 
God told him to sit and meditate. The boy sat down and 
immediately went into Samadhi, which is a transcended 
state of one-pointed awareness. 
When his friends saw him sitting cross-legged  with 
his eyes closed they believed he was playing. They went to 
him and tried to get him to respond by teasing him. They 
punched him, tried to pry his eyelids open and, when he 
did not respond, they dragged him to the canal and threw 
him in. He sank and did not move. It was at this point, 
they realized this was no joke. The boys pulled him from 
the canal and desperately ran to alert the elders of the 
village. When his mother and the uneducated elders 
arrived, they thought he was possessed by a spirit and 
struck him hard in the head with a cane to break the spell. 
52 

The boy jumped to his feet, explained his vision to the 
villagers and told them he must sit in mediation just as God 
told him to. He sat back down in the open field and went 
back into Samadhi. The villagers did not know what to do 
and thought this idea would pass and he would come back 
to normal consciousness soon - But he  never did. Nor did 
he ever return to his mother's house but  instead  stayed  in 
the  spot where he had the vision. 
Each and every day he sat for 23 hours at a time in 
unbroken Samadhi. He sat through the rainstorms, the 
scorching heat of summer and the cool nights of winter. 
At midnight he would come out of Samadhi, drink a glass 
of milk provided by his mother and eat a piece of fruit and 
go to the  canal to bathe.  Then, at 1 a.m., he would go back 
into Samadhi until midnight the next  night. Eventually, the 
villagers built  him a small concrete shelter to protect him. 
As per the vision, the boy was to do this for 8 years. 
Hid completed this phase and then, for the next 4 years, 
mediated for  12 hours a day. After the 12 years, he 
53 

completed his austerities (called Tapas) and emerged full of 
light and with great powers. He later became known in 
India as the Rainmaker Yogi. This is because during an 
unusually long drought the reser
v
oir dried up and the 
Indian government made a formal written request for him 
to make it rain to relive the drought, which he did. This was 
documented on tape. So the Indian government officially 
declared him a national treasure. 
Did Daskalos he have such a sudden awakening as a 
child? No, he never lost consciousness as he admitted, 
remembering all previous experiences of his earth life, and 
the subsequent psychical and noetical experiences after 
each physical incarnation. As Daskalos revealed, he had 
the unfortunate ability to remember  everything. He was 
fully awake during his birth in this lifetime and later, when 
he was three years old, he stunned his father by confirming 
all the details of his own birth. 
Now I come to the point for telling these Indian 
stories. It is very dangerous to obtain books with 
54 

advanced eastern techniques and try them on your own. 
Historically, eastern masters gave these techniques to their 
own students only when the master knew the student was 
sufficiently trained and ready. 
Daskalos had cases where, while performing eastern 
meditations people had damaged their nervous system, 
which caused nervous disorders and Schizophrenia. There 
is currently a case where a young person who read books 
about  Ramana Maharshi, Shiva Bala Yogi, and other Hindu 
masters of the distant  past fancied himself as such a yogi. 
This person tried to mediate for hours and hours like an 
advanced yogi, but only succeeded in ha,;ng a serious 
mental breakdown. Now the moral of all this is best 
summed up in a Taoist saying, which states: "If you tr)' to 
cut  wood like a master woodworker you will only succeed 
in hurting your hand." 
Of course these kinds of damages are not the fault 
of the eastern spiritual systems. But some of these eastern 
methods, which  may be all right for the eastern mind and 
55 

netYous system, may not be good for the western mind and 
nerYous systems, which are already overstressed. 
Remember, these advanced yogis did not hold down 9-to-5 
jobs, raise children, have cellular phones, or send daily 
emails and tweets. They typically lived lives of solitude -
isolated from the stresses of a worldly life. 
We need not transplant advanced eastern methods 
of awakening to the west - we alrcaJi have proven 
methods, which are safe for western man. So what does a 
western man need to awaken? Western men and women 
are in need of learning how to use the mind properly in 
introspection, observation, visualization and safe forms of 
meditations. We can express and develop a kind of self­
consciousness in the various states of its expression by 
using the mind in the correct way. But we must be very 
careful. Self is a different thing from the consciousness, 
which the Self is expressing. Many people make the mistake 
to mix up the consciousness with the Self. What we call 
Self-Consciousness is simply how we as a self use the Mind 
56 

in creating 
emotions, 
desires 
and thoughts, 
which 
lead to 
words 
and actions. 
We have to use the mind 
as light in the proper 
way, 
so that we will know 
what our soul-self 
is beyond 
its 
reflections, 
as body,  emotions 
and thoughts. 
Then 
we can 
understand 
what 
our real self is and what God is.  Only 
then we will achieve 
our aim of True Self-Realization. 
\'v'hat 
about 
Awakening 
on psychical 
planes 
after a sudden death 
of the material 
body 
from 
a gunshot? 
First, let's 
consider 
what happens 
after a natural 
death 
to a person 
who has not developed 
their body while 
on Earth; 
someone 
who had no interest 
spiritual 
matters 
but was only 
concerned 
with Earthly 
affairs. 
As we said in 
a previous 
lesson, 
the Guardian 
Angel 
holds 
the perfect 
and bright psychical 
and noetical 
bodies 
as Archetypes 
for 
the human 
being. 
Our material 
body 
is prm�ded 
to us in 
perfect 
condition; 
we do not have to build 
it ourselves. 
It 
grows 
and is sustained 
without 
much 
effort 
on the part of 
our  personality. 
But  it is up to us to build our physical 
and 
57 

noetical bodies. We do this through the emotions,  desires 
and thoughts we harbor and express while on Earth. What 
happens to the man who has not developed noble 
emotions and the higher reasoning faculties of their mind? 
What happens when this person passes over to the 
psychical planes? 
Of course there is no God or Archangel that 
punishes him by forcing him into any hell or paradise he is 
not experiencing now. Rather his own vibration, his tone 
(as the Sufi mystics call it), places him to the plane or sub­
plane that he vibrates in harmony with. The transfer of his 
or her self-consciousness from this world to the next is 
automatic. His vibration, his tone as a personality, is 
created by the thoughts, desires, words and actions he has 
expressed on Earth. All these together create what we call 
a "shell hell" or a "shell paradise." After the death of the 
material body the person awakens on the psychical planes. 
However, they only awaken in their "shell hell" or "shell 
58 

paradise." Don't we see people all around you on earth that 
are also living in their shells? 
An invisible helper in our system or anyone who has 
fully awakened and can live self-consciously in their fully 
developed psychical body, will see this person in a dreamy 
state of sub-consciousness. They will be found semi­
awakened, but only ..,;thin their shell world and not fully 
awakened in the brilliant, glorious psychical worlds. 
The invisible helpers who try to assist people in the 
hells find the surrounding em;ronment of that person's 
shell very beautiful. It is wonderful with mountains and 
lakes and better conditions of life than here on Earth. 
However, the light is not strong, because the divine mercy 
provides only as much light as is comfortable to the people 
who live there.  It is just like we have ample light around 
us, yet in a hospital the nurses close the curtains to have 
less light for a patient to recuperate. These recently 
departed ones are not awakened in the psychical worlds 
because they do not have a fully developed psychical body. 
59 

And just as we said, there are no two personalities that are 
exactly the same; likewise there are no two shells (shell hells 
or shell paradises) that are exactly identical for the   same 
reason.  They differ greatly depending on the self­
awareness and development of each person. What counts 
in shaping the psychical body is the self-consciousness in it. 
This psychical body gets its true form when and only when 
one develops his or her self-conscicusness as a personality. 
What happens to a person after a sudden death from 
a gunshot or any sudden death?  Basically the same thing 
except, if there has been much trauma from the earth life, 
that person has a period of sleep to calm down the 
vibrations from the trauma. Then, they just will find 
themselves in their shell automatically just as in the case of 
a natural death.  In both cases the person's elementals can 
and do attach to their possessions and the places they 
inhabit. A sensitive person may be able to feel these strong 
elementals and a clairvoyant may see certain ones in the 
form of the departed person. This gives the impression 
60 

that 
the 
"Ghost" 
of that 
person 
is haunting 
their 
old 
habit
ats. 
What 
about 
a person 
who 
has 
already 
fully 
awakened 
self-consciously 
while 
on earth 
and 
then 
they 
pass 
over 
by 
way 
of a natural 
or sudden 
death, 
that 
person 
will 
not 
awaken 
in a shell. 
They 
will 
simply 
find 
themselves 
on the 
psychical 
planes, 
fully 
awake. 
They 
will 
not 
lose 
consciousness 
during 
the 
change 
we call 
death. 
This 
is 
what  Christ  meant 
when 
he said 
to his disciples, 
"Some 
of 
you  here 
will 
not 
taste 
death," 
meaning 
they 
will 
not 
go 
unconscious 
during 
the  transfer 
of their 
self-consciousness 
from 
the  material 
world 
to the 
psychical 
world. 
He did not 
mean  they 
would 
live 
forever 
in a material 
body. 
We 
might 
be inclined 
to think 
that 
a sudden 
death 
is 
preferable 
over 
a long  slow 
decline 
where 
the ravages 
of 
old  age 
take 
their 
toll. 
But 
remember 
people 
ha,,e  many 
strong earthy 
attachments. 
In fact, 
most 
of our 
elementals 
are associated 
with 
our 
earthly 
life. 
So it is part 
of the 
61 

natural process that, as we grow old, we slowly lose interest 
in our earthly attachments and they fall away more gently. 
Whereas a person who experiences a sudden death does 
not ha,·e time to prepare and release their earthly 
attachments. Now, if that departed personality is very 
materialistic the pull of his earthly attachments to people 
places and things can be pairrfally strong. But as we said 
last week the force of evolution, the transformational 
impulse, is stronger and drags the unwilling onward in his 
ordained journey through the worlds of existence. But we 
see this same problem all the time on Earth. People get 
attached to old habitual ways of living and when it is time 
to grow and move on they often do so kicking and 
screaming, dragging their feet in resistance as it were. 
This brings us to the issue of free will and destiny. 
Both exist and a simple analogy can be used to explain how 
they work together. If we board an airplane flying from 
New York to London, we can consider the overall journey 
a destined experience. You board the plane in New York 
62 

and you get off the plane in London. However, how we 
behave on that plane is up to our free will to a certain 
degree. We can sleep, we can chat with the people next to 
us, we can read a magazine, or be uplifted by reading a 
spiritual book or listening to inspirational music. We can 
contemplate God, we can meditate on our own di,�ne 
nature, or we can drink those little bottles of alcohol. It is 
up to us. This is our free will. Llke..,-ise, we are here on 
Earth living out our lifetime, so that's clearly our destiny, 
but what we choose to do during this destined lifetime is 
our  free will. And it is up to us how we choose to behave 
during this journey and that is what casts our fate on Earth 
and in the worlds beyond. 
In the next lesson we will see the difference between 
man-made gods and the one true God; and what it means 
for us to change spiritually.

Questions 
Q. Since "each elemental owns a psychic and noetical
counterpart which inherits the intentions of its creator," 
could it be that elementals may also carry a signature­
imprint of the creator's psyche's desire for evolving? 
What I mean is do you imagine that elementals are looking 
to evolve and be liberated tour 
A: As we said most elementals are desire based elementals 
and their force is more of an effect of devolution on our 
personalit
y
.  But we also do have noble thought based 
elementals, which do have the intention of helping us and 
others awaken spiritually. But the purpose of an 
elemental's entire existence is to fulfill the aim it was 
created for. Even this kind the intent of awakening 
spiritually is not for the elemental but its creator. 
However, Daskalos used to experiment with destructive 
elementals he removed from people to see if he could get 
them to change. He had and amazing degree of control 
64 

over elementals and had on occasion removed hostel ones 
from  people and then rather than de-energize it by sending 
it into a  flame or by other means, he tried reprogramming 
giving it a new directive to do some good. In this way he 
repurposed the  negative elemental to be beneficial. For 
example, one  time as he told me,  Daskalos took a 
particularly hostile destructive elemental off a suffering 
person that had been created by a black magician and then 
reprogrammed it to protect his  flowers outside his  front 
door. But  initially that  did  not go so well because the 
elemental started to carry  out its new purpose as a guardian 
but  with  some of its original hostility. So when smdents 
coming to Daskalos' front  door got too close to the 
flowers, the elemental attacked them. So Daskalos had to 
work 
with it  some  more to get  it to guard without hostilit
y
. 
In this case we can see that elementals can be altered, 
improved and in that way we can say they changed; but 
they did not evolve by their own desire or effort. 
65 

Q. If a   person with a mental illness passes over do 
they awaken in their shell in the same condition or is there 
some grace that frees them? 
A. When a person's material body dies, their 
personality typically goes into a deep sleep during the 
transition we call death. When Christ said to his disciples 
some of you will not taste death. He did not mean their 
material body would never die. He meant that some of his 
most advanced followers would be self-aware  enough to 
go through the change called death without going 
unconscious. This means their self-awareness would not 
be broken during the transition. 
In the case of a mentally ill person, they would 
enjoy a sweet period of rest. The length of time of this 
sleep can vary but a typical time for a case like this would 
be about 40 days. One purpose of this sleep is to give 
rest to people who have undergone very hard experiences 
66 

on earth. Also the so-called life review is given during 
this 
sleep period when the personality is passive and 
more 
likely to accept the real truth about the earth life they just 
lived. 
Pathology aside, seriously losing control over ones' 
thoughts and emotions can result in mental illness. When 
nonsensical  thoughts and wild emotions gain control over 
a personality they can and sometimes do drive them 
insane. Since we are responsible for our own thoughts 
and emotions the person, to a degree, must correct the 
conclitions causing this  loss of control - so they have 
some karma to work out. But God helps the personality 
by shouldering their  karmic  cross maybe as much as  90%. 
Why not 100% If God was to wipe that all away, the 
person would learn nothing and just recreate the same 
conditions in the future. 
So upon waking in the psychical plane the departed 
is exactly the same personality they were the moment 
67 

before passing over. No one dies a criminal and awakens 
on the other side as a saint. 
During this sleep, the mentally ill person has been 
calmed downed, and shown the honest truth about the 
earth life they just finished.  Hopefully they have a more 
sane understanding from their life review. So upon 
awaking they are in a much better state to move forward. 
But they must choose a better way of living on the other 
side and not just re awaken their old disturbed thoughts 
and emotions, which still exist in their sub-consciousness. 
If they do awaken them, they will simply recreate their 
psychological shell like they knew on earth. So passing 
over to another plane of existence does not wipe out all 
our karma. Again, I am not talking about a pathological 
case with this example. When there is a physical defect in 
the material brain, upon passing  over, the pathological 
issue would be automatically relieved because they would 
no longer have a physical brain with that defect. 
68 

There is no punishing God or Archangel sending 
one person to a paradise and another person to a hell. 
No external entity is keeping anyone in anyone in a hell if 
they  decide to leave it. We place  ourselves in ether a 
conditional paradise or a conditional hell or maybe a bit of 
both by our own vibrations. Our vibrations automatically 
deliver us to one of the sub planes of the psychical worlds 
that we vibrate in harmony with. Our vibration or our 
tone is created by the sum total of our thoughts, 
intentions, emotions,  desires,  motivations and behaviors 
we harbor and express. This is the driving mechanism. 
69 

Meditation 
What 
does it mean 
to concentrate? 
When 
you fix your 
attention somewhere, 
no matter 
where, 
try not to allow 
thoughts 
and emotions 
to come 
and disturb 
you. Close 
the 
doors 
of the sub consciousness. 
When 
you start, 
you will 
find that various 
thoughts 
and many, 
many 
things 
will 
bombard 
you all the time. 
Y c;.;  have 
to do two things: 
concentrate 
and avoid 
being 
disturbed. 
These 
are two 
different 
kinds 
of work. 
Now 
for the exercise: 
Put your tips of your fingers 
of the 
left hand 
against 
the tips of the fingers 
of your right hand. 
Concentrate 
and feel where 
the one finger 
touches 
the 
other, 
but keep your palms 
apart 
- only the tips of your 
fingers 
and thumbs 
are lightly 
touching 
each other. 
Feel the space 
between 
the palms. 
I want 
you to feel the 
pulse 
of life as gentle 
warmth 
and a vibration 
there. 
You 

will feel these vibrations by concentrating in the space 
between the palms. 
Have no thoughts or feelings and do not allow anything to 
disturb you. 
Concentrate, which means to be there in your hands! 
Try to feel but understand what you are feeling. Try to feel 
the vibrations between the palms. Concentrate on the 
warmth between the palms and try to sense the vibrations 
that are generating this warmth. 
Now concentrating on the vibrations, bring in your mind 
this thought: I want to fully co-operate with the Holy Spirit 
and Archangels. I do not want to be passive observer but 
an active participant in their work. Concentrate on the 
vibrations and this thought 
71 

Now feel the hands, the space between the palms, and feel 
the all of the hands now, the fingers, the whole hand, all 
the way up until the elbows. 
Feel your hands from the shoulders down. Visualize white 
light in your hands from the shoulders down. See with your 
mind white light radiating from your hands. Now you feel 
the vibrations stronger. 
Bless your hands to become healing hands, instruments of 
the Holy Spirit. 

Chapter3 
Changing 
"God Is" and "God exists" are two different states 
of one Reality. God is Absolute Life. And God exists as 
the expression of all the countless temporary forms of life 
on Earth as well as in the other worlds of existence. 
God is the everlasting Selfhood in its total Self­
sufficiency, the Absolute  Infinite Bein
gn
ess. Nothing is 
beyond His power and authority. God is composed of an 
infinite number of immortal Spirit Beings. He also exists, 
in creation, in all the worlds of existence, which is the 
Divine Will of Absolute Bein
gn
ess: God. The world of 
manifestation is one of the natures of Absolute Infinite 
Bein
gn
ess. Absolute Bein
gn
ess is God in Manifestation as 
the Logos and the Holy Spirit. 
We use the word Absolute Beingness because it 
carries more meaning than the word God, which has been 
greatly misused and confused with the anthropomorphic 
73 

gods of the past (by anthropomorphic gods I mean those 
gods, which have been invented by man and ascribed 
human characteristics). For example, the gods of the 
ancient Greeks were depicted as vengeful, amorous, jealous 
and with the full range of human strengths and weaknesses. 
This type of "god" existed in all past times. 
What made the people from the time of the caveman 
to the present create these gods? Perhaps it was out of fear 
or due to feeling a paternalistic need to believe there was 
something wiser and stronger than their personalities to 
protect them from their hostile environment. 
Maybe it came from an inner impulse within 
mankind to seek its true source. This means they were 
using reason to find the truth because all people in the past 
and in present have at some time sensed they are more than 
their petty personalities. 
Who were the first gods? Mostly they were what 
the people feared: Bears, lions, lightning, volcanoes and 
earth<juakes were making primitive man afraid and they felt 
74 

the need to pray to these forces in order to feel protected. 
The ancients created many "protector" gods above them 
endowed with strengths and enough power to save them 
from harm. 
How did the prim.ith·e people create these 
anthropomorphic gods?  They did it subconsciously, not 
understanding what they were doing, by using the i\Iind as 
thought. This is something animals could not do. 
Animals cannot use the l\,lind as thought, but they can use 
the Mind as instinct, or rather, the nature spirit in the body 
of  the animal is the one doing  that. Animals ii,·e in 
harmony with  their environment; they do not need to 
create gods, they  ne,·er  have and never will create a god. 
Human beings are the only creatures that go so out of 
harmony with themselves and their em-ironment. 
Humans  continued creating these kinds of gods 
through the ages. They were always ascribing human 
,·irtues and vices to their  gods. They wanted their gods to 
take revenge on their enemies. The ancient Jews were 
75 

feeling jealous of others so they imagined 
their god, 
Jehovah, 
was also jealous. 
We see that in all the past 
civilizations 
they were giving characteristics 
of people living 
at that time to their gods. 
These gods existed then and they exist now: the gods 
of the Lemurians, 
then the Atlantians; 
the E
gy
ptians, the 
Hindus, 
the Greeks, 
the Mayans 
and the Incas. They exist 
now because 
they were 
created with the Mind, which 
means they are living elementals 
that cannot be destroyed. 
Of course, most of these anthropomorphic 
gods have 
become 
de-energized 
through disinterest 
... with the 
exception 
of some of the Hindu gods. 
Did these elemental 
gods have the power to help 
their worshipers? 
Yes, because 
these conceptual 
gods 
were empowered 
by the thoughts 
and prayers of many 
people over 
long periods 
of time. This created massive, 
group elementals. 
Tens of thousands 
of people gave 
energy and power to those elementals 
to serve the people 
and protect them. 
76 

They were even more powerful at the time of 
Atlantis because at that time, the Atlantians still had the use 
of creative thought, meaning their gods could actually 
materialize and physically affect things and people on 
Earth. They were only collective elementals but extremely 
powerful. These gods existed in all past times and they 
exist  now in the Cosmic Consciousness. 
Again, the word "god" minimizes Absolute 
Beingness to our limited understanding. In an effort to 
use  more meaningful terms we use Absolute Beingness and 
mention something of God's characteristics such as  motion 
- vibration, which is the essential nature of all life. 
At  the highest level of this motion is Law and Cause 
without anything moving. This motion, which does not 
move, is the Divine Will. 
We understand and believe that everything is within 
this Absolute Beingness, God. Absolute Beingness is  not 
characterized by a male or female personality. This is  why 
sometimes we refer to God as "It" and not as he  or  she. 
77 

Absolute 
Beingness 
is expressed 
within 
Itself, 
as referred 
to 
in our beginning 
prayer. 
It is expressing 
Itself 
as Total 
Wisdom, 
Total 
Love 
and Total 
Might. 
Christianity 
has made 
a great 
mistake ignoring 
God 
the Father 
and concentrating 
on Its expression 
as the 
Christ Logos: 
the Son of God. 
The 
Logos 
is the 
expression 
of God 
the Father 
the Absolute. 
God 
the 
Father 
is the source 
of the Son and thus 
an expression 
cannot 
be greater 
or wiser 
than 
its source. 
Even 
Christ 
said, 
"My 
Father 
is greater 
than 
I am." 
In full attunement 
with 
Absolute Beingness, 
Christ 
said, 
"I and my Father 
are 
one." 
He did not say he was God 
the Father 
but he was 
one with 
the Father. 
Pay attention 
to this difference. 
The 
Logos 
is the Absolute 
Beingness 
in manifestation 
just like 
the Holy 
Spirit 
is, but this is the important 
point: 
Do not 
ignore 
the first cause 
and only 
pay attention 
to Its 
manifestation. 
God 
the Father 
is the Absolute 
Total 
Wisdom, but 
we can only 
detect 
Absolute 
Total 
Wisdom 
by studying Its 
78 

manifestations. We are using the word "detect" and not 
"conceive." Detecting means knowing. Conceiving means 
forming an idea or opinion based on the limited 
perceptions of our senses and in our mind. We can detect 
the Total Wisdom of the cause behind its manifestation by 
stud)�ng the effects of this manifestation in the Worlds of 
Existence. This includes the Noetical, Psychical and 
Material Worlds. 
The Divine Absolute Infinite Selfhood is not in need 
of us acknowledging or loving It.  In doing so we are 
attuning to the   Divine Reality, which benefits us, but even 
if we do not love or care about Absolute Beingness, it 
never ceases loving and caring for us. 
Some scientists 
do not like the terms "God" 
or 
"Absolute Beingness" and prefer to call the Divine 
manifestation 
of life the wisdom 
of nature. 
This so-called 
wisdom of nature governs all the manifestations of life with 
laws.  Where 
do they  think 
the laws come from if not from 
a Law Giver? 
79 

Absolute Beingness is expressed within Itself, as referred to 
in our beginning prayer.  It is expressing Itself as Total 
Wisdom, Total Love and Total Might. 
Christianity has made a great mistake ignoring God 
the Father and concentrating on Its expression as the 
Christ Logos: the Son of God. The Logos is the 
expression of God the Father the Absolute. God the 
Father is the source of the Son and thus an expression 
cannot be greater or wiser than its source. Even Christ 
said, "My Father is greater than I am."  In full attunement 
with Absolute Beingness, Christ said, "I and my Father are 
one."  He did not say he was God the Father but he was 
one with the Father.  Pay attention to this difference. The 
Logos is the Absolute Beingness in manifestation just like 
the Holy Spirit is, but this is the important point: Do not 
ignore the first cause and only pay attention to Its 
manifestation. 
God the Father is the Absolute Total Wisdom, but 
we can only detect Absolute Total Wisdom by studying Its 
78 

manifestations. We are using the word "detect" and not 
"conceive."  Detecting means knowing. Conceiving means 
forming an idea or opinion based on the limited

never ceases loving and caring for us. 
Some scientists do not like the terms "God" or 
"Absolute Beingness" and prefer to call the DiYine 
manifestation of life the wisdom of nature. This so-called 
wisdom of nature governs all the manifestations of life with 
laws.  Where do they think the laws come from if not from 
a Law Giver? 
79 

Nature 
is an integrated 
system 
consisting 
of an 
incalculable 
number 
of little 
tiny parts 
all working 
together 
because 
of its design. 
It is designed 
by the creators 
of the 
creation: 
God 
as Logos, 
God 
as Holy 
Spirit. 
The word 
nature 
originally 
came 
from 
the Egyptian 
word 
Neter, 
which 
meant 
God. 
Neter 
eventually 
became 
the Latin 
word 
Nat-Tuur-A 
and later became 
the English 
word 
Nature. 
Originally 
the word 
nature 
was giving 
us the 
true meaning: 
Nature 
is the expression 
of God 
as all the life 
in all the worlds of 
existence. 
As a human 
being 
we can research 
the truth 
of God 
and in doing 
so will discover 
the truth 
concerning 
our own 
nature, both 
our human 
nature 
and our radiant 
Divine 
Nature. 
We will discover 
we 
exist 
as human 
beings 
but in 
our Divine Nature 
we are gods. 
Every 
one of us as a Spirit 
Soul Self is a god. 
Christ 
said we all are gods 
- sons 
and 
daughters 
of God. 
And when 
He said that, 
the Jews 
tried 
to stone 
him f<;>r it.  Much 
later in time 
a Muslim 
Mystic 
80 

said the same thing and they crucified him upside down. 
Today it is safer to speak of these things. 
So we are Gods in the realm of Beingness and we 
exist as human beings in the Words of Existence, but do 
human beings feel  the Self-Abundance, the Self Sufficiency 
of their Divine Narure as Gods? Unfortunately no, there is 
no lasting sense of absolute Self-Sufficiency in any of the 
Worlds of Existence for humankind. 
In our deep meditations and contemplations we can 
find a primary  factor of our existence. We find that we are 
using the  Holy substance of Mind, all the time. If we make 
proper use of it, we can come to know the truth. If we 
make bad use of it we enter deeper into illusions, feel more 
cut off and separated from real life and this brings more 
undesirable consequences to our bodies. 
The 
way of 
illusion 
cannot 
last forever 
because 
just 
like all 
of nature 
we 
are under 
Divine 
Laws 
too.  These 
ine
scap
able laws 
govern 
our  development 
or what  you 
m
ight 
be 
tempted to 
call: 
spiritual 
evolution. 
Really, 
it is 
81 

the evolution of our awareness. This means the self is 
raising its consciousness. It raises its consciousness to 
higher and higher levels by using reason. 
We cannot stay in the darkness of unknowing 
forever. We are in need of the light, we are thirsty for that 
light and we are drawn to the light by an inescapable 
force/law. Maybe this is what Carl Jung was calling the 
"transformational impulse." It is the ultimately irresistible 
impulse that transforms the mortal into the immortal, as 
Christ said. It is the transmutation of darkness into light. 
We can say it this metaphorical way but the truth is 
we are the Soul Self, which is the light. So the only thing 
transforming is our way of perceiving our self. It is the 
understanding of our self that changes its identification 
from the varying strengths and weaknesses of the 
personality to the inextinguishable blazing light of Soul Self 
Awareness. 
How do we do that? This is done by entering the 
kingdoms of the heavens consciously. Where are the 
82 

heavens? When asked this by the Pharisees Christ said: 
"The coming of the kingdom of Heaven is not something 
that can be observed, nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 
'There it is,' because the kingdom of Heaven is within 
you." But what did he mean by "within you?" Where is 
he referring? Did he mean within your material body? 
As a personality we may be tempted to think that 
"within" means within our material body. Of course 
"within" does not mean inside the material body, because 
we as Spirit Souls  are not limited to being confined in a 
material body. We as human beings are something greater, 
something so much higher than just our expression as 
material body or a personality, but as long as we are 
entangled and identified with our egoism, we cannot see or 
understand our  real Self. 
Right 
now we 
only see and understand 
our self 
from 
our 
reflection 
in the mirrors 
of matter, 
emotio
n and 
th
ought
. 
These 
are just tantalizing 
illusions 
in time 
and 
s
pac
e. 
To see 
and know 
our real 
Soul Self 
we 
must 
turn 
83 

\Vithin and see 
i
t face to face. "Within" is timeless state 
beyond the conception of space. 
What is the real "Self'' we must turn to face? 
Certainly it is not our material body, which is built and 
cared for by the Holy Spirit and the Archangelic workers. 
All that amazing and complicated work is taking place 
without our help. And the real "Self'' is certainly not the 
constantly changing personality. In fact we, as a personality, 
interfere with the Holy Spirit's great work by behaving in 
an egoistic way over taxing the body. This brings illnesses 
to us as conse
q
uences. 
Living in this way we are not living self-consciously 
or even consciously. We are living subconsciously, which 
does not give us any real gain or much satisfaction in our 
life. The end result of this way of living is dissatisfaction, 
pain, sorrow, and misery that sometimes will lead a person 
to suicide - all brought about by the misuse of the Mind. 
Think about it - we can use the Mind any way we want. 
With a proper understanding we are free to keep the water 
84 

of our mind pure, clean and fresh to quench our thirst or 
we can pollute it with unclean thoughts, emotions and 
desires to the point of illness. 
Again, we are free to come out of these illusions if 
we decided and learn the way to do that.  No one is   forcing 
us to live as slaves to a dead and meaningless material life. 
No one is insisting we live under the pain of torturing 
emotions and thoughts. �'hat do these things bring to us? 
They don't bring real satisfaction even to the personality. 
Really, how many people today can say they are completely 
satisfied with their life? 
So what is the way we teach to come out of these 
illusions and rid ourselves of torturing emotions and 
thoughts? The way requires using the Mind as reason to 
come to come to good conclusions. This means using the 
Mind to make our material, emotional and mental life 
pleasant and satisfying or come to a clear understand of the 
purpose and aim in our life. Nothing is without a cause or 
a purpose; we must find it for ourselves. Finding this truth 
85 

will 
really 
set us free 
from 
our illusion, 
and the pain 
giving 
emotions 
and thoughts. 
Having 
said 
all that, 
the way 
is in the proper 
use of 
the Mind. 
Now 
a question 
arises: 
Who 
is going 
to use the 
Mind 
to do this work? 
Who 
will use the Mind 
to come 
out 
of the ignorance 
of suffering 
and into 
the light 
of freedom? 
Daskalos 
had a doctor 
from 
America 
come 
to see 
him. 
He was suffering 
and Daskalos 
gave 
him 
advice 
about 
using 
the Mind 
and pushed 
the doctor 
to ask him 
who 
was 
going 
to use the Mind 
to fix these 
things. 
Finally, 
after 
much 
nudging, 
the man 
asked, 
''Who 
is 
going 
to use the Mind?" 
Daskalos 
replied, 
"You! 
But have 
you 
found 
who 
you are?" 
The 
doctor retorted, 
"Mr. 
Attehslis 
please, 
don't 
tell 
me I do not know 
who 
I am!" 
Daskalos 
affirmed, 
"Definitely 
you 
don't 
know 
who 
you are!" 
You 
think 
you know, 
but definitely 
you 
do not 
86 

know who you are.  If you knew who you were, you would 
behave in a different way." 
Sadly, this doctor was physically beating his wife 
when he got angry. He thought he had the right to do this 
when she did not obey him.  This is a very bad form of 
egoism. 
Das!rnlos continued, "'{ ou will use the Mind but the 
you, you think you are (a male with a body and a name) is 
not  the real  you.  That is because that  'you' will not last 
many, many more years and it may be not here tomorrow if 
you have a car accident. So what you think you are now is 
not really you. " 
The doctor said, ''Well I had a car accident but 
happily I was not killed and finished." 
Daskalos then explained that there was no death but 
a passing over into a different state of life. 
The 
doctor reacted strongly and said, 
'No, 
no ... there is no life after death!" 
87 

Daskalos said, '1t's alright if you don't want to 
accept it  from me trying to explain it to you." 
But doctor pursued this line of thought and asked, 
"Do you mean if I have an accident or an illness and die I 
shall exist as I am now?" 
Daskalos responded, "Unfortunately ... yes." 
"What do you mean by unfortunately yes?" The 
doctor asked. 
Daskalos explained the "unfortunately yes", saying 
that all those negative elementals composing the doctor's 
egoism and personality would be carried with the doctor 
when he passed over. Daskalos added that, unless the 
doctor changed his behavior now, that after death he could 
be found on the other side beating his wife. In reality he 
would be beating an elemental of his wife that he created 
himself. 
The doctor stared at Daskalos as he continued to 
describe this process of passing over and ending up in a 
sub-plane of the psychical worlds the doctor was in 
88 

harmony with. He described how the doctor would be just 
as he was the moment before passing over with the same 
name and the same unfortunate behaviors creating the 
same hellish conditions as he had in his Earth life. 
When Daskalos had finished, the doctor said, 'Sir do 
you know you are giving me a headache?" "Yes, I feel a 
headache -Goodbye." And he left. 
The doctor never came back to continue the 
conversation but one day it will be a necessity to face his 
condition. Because this kind of life will not give him 
satisfaction and that will eventually require him to turn and 
face the  truth. Sooner or later we all will  have  turn and 
face  the inner reality and  the truth. We cannot  stay in the 
time and place shadows of our ignorance forever. We 
eventually must come to the treasure of our real Self. 
No material thing can be ours for long so material 
things are not the real treasure. The real treasure is our 
Soul Self the incorruptible Human Idea. The Human Form 
89 

is a Law, a Cause and an Idea with real power apart from its 
material expression as a material body. 
With the practice of deep meditation and unbroken 
concentration in time we can reach that high, high stage to 
come face to face with the truth of this teaching. Then we 
will come to understand what we are as the archetypal Idea 
of Man, apart from its time and place personality. The 
characteristic of the Idea of Man is its expression as the 
Divine Soul. 
When we say that everything IS and Exists, it is due 
to the formless super substance of the Mind. All the 
universes the material, psychical and noetical universes are 
made from the Mind at different rates of vibrations. All 
the stars, all the planets and all the galaxies are like little tiny 
molecules moving in this ocean of the Mind. Motion is a 
prime characteristic of life and so all these heavenly bodies 
are in motion. 
Mind is the Will and Total Wisdom of Absolute 
Beingness. Yet the Mind is not God. It is the means used 
90 

by 
God in creating these universes. 
Everythin
g existin
g has 
come from  the Mind, but  not by chance and  not by 
evolution as some suppose. 
Certain materialists believe that life, all the forms of 
life, initially evolved from a primordial soup of chemicals 
and through some unnamed  mysterious force, and one­
celled life forms came into existence. Those one-celled life 
forms  slowly  evolved  into  higher and more complicated 
forms of life reaching the zenith as man. Really, that is like 
believing  that the blind force of a tornado passing through 
a junkyard full  of different materials could, given enough 
time, eventually construct the Taj Mahal. 
So life and all the countless forms of life here and in 
the worlds beyond did not come in to existence by accident 
or blind chance; it came by following an orderly Divine 
Plan, which is the Total Wisdom of the Absolute Beingness 
as Law and Cause. 
Now that we know more about the mind, what else 
can we discover? We know for sure that we as a Self-
91 

Awareness 
can 
and 
should 
use 
the 
l\ilind 
consciously. 
Common 
people 
living 
sub 
consciously 
are 
not 
using the 
:Vlind 
properly. 
We 
also 
know 
that 
the 
Archangels 
of all 
the 
orders 
are 
using 
the 
l\llind 
Super-Consciously 
as creative 
thought. 
Their 
thought 
produces 
living 
forms 
of life ... all 
the 
forms 
of life 
we 
see 
all around 
us every 
day. 
They 
are 
constantly 
materializing 
their 
thoughts. 
their 
elementals 
into 
living 
forms. 
Since 
a human 
being 
is also 
a god 
equivalent 
to the 
Archangels, 
why 
can't 
human 
beings 
do the 
same? 
Our 
Eternal 
Spirit 
Self 
is an Archangel 
but 
has 
become 
a human 
being 
to get 
experiences 
in the 
worlds 
of separation. 
Sometimes 
the 
Church 
refers 
to humans 
as Fallen 
Archangels. 
We 
are 
not 
the 
fallen 
Archangels. 
We 
have 
not 
fallen, 
instead 
we 
have 
been 
blessed 
by God 
descend 
into 
the 
words 
of existence. 
We 
enter 
these 
worlds 
of 
existence 
to know 
more 
fully 
by direct 
experience 
all of 
God's 
creation 
and 
then 
return 
back 
to God 
enriched 
and 
more 
privileged 
that 
any 
of the 
other 
Archangels. 
The 
92 

Archangels never came out of their unification with God _ 
Just as it says in Christ's parable of the lost son. 
At some point in our journey back to  God, we will 
be again entrusted with creative thought and use the 
creative ether to materialize our thoughts. We had this 
ability in the clistant past and sadly lost it by misuse. But a 
few have managed to regain it now. We can read in the 
Old Testament how some were materializing their thoughts 
and casring fire during wars with other cultures. We see 
similar accounts  also from Ancient Greece and in the early 
days of Inclia. 
Humans have lost this power by horribly misusing it 
to kill  other humans; but the human race will regain this 
power. Just as soon as they deserve to have it, it will be 
restored to them. Now just think about that for a minute. 
Are we really saying that human beings will be  able to 
materialize their thoughts and have this kind of tremendous 
power at their clisposal? Yes for sure. How can we claim 
that is true? 
93 

What 
did Christ, 
say? 
He said, 
'1 tell you, 
whoever 
believes 
in me (that 
means 
believes 
and 
knows 
what 
he said 
and 
taught) 
will 
do 
the works 
I have 
been 
doing, 
and 
they 
will do even 
greater 
things 
than 
these. 
Truly 
I tell you, 
if you 
have 
faith 
as small 
as a 
mustard 
seed, 
you 
can say to this 
mountain, 
'Move from 
here 
to there,' 
and 
it will move. 
Nothing 
will be impossible 
for you" 
We really 
should 
read 
what 
Christ 
was 
saying. 
He 
came 
to say 
who 
we really 
are and 
what 
we are really 
capable 
of.  This 
is the real 
Christianity. 
Christianity 
is not 
the dogmas 
some 
people 
today 
consider 
as Christianity. 
So the question 
in everyone's 
mind 
should 
be:  ''How 
can we come 
to that 
point 
of development?" 
The 
answer 
is by first 
and 
foremost 
by acknowledging 
who 
we really 
are. 
This 
means 
coming 
to a true 
understanding 
that 
we 
are not what 
we have been thinking we 
are - a   personality 
with 
a narrow 
range 
of strengths 
and 
weakness 
and 
by 
94 

understanding that our personality's egoism is the sum total 
of all the emotion and thought elementals we have been 
harboring and projecting. We are not all that. We are 
something so much greater. Our emotions and thoughts 
today are elementals that surface from our sub­
consciousness and persuade us to re-express them and thus 
re-energize them to prolong their life in us. 
After finding this truth, slowly we start to dis­
identify our self from our constantly changing emotions 
and thoughts. Then we find our way, but where is this way 
leading us?  Some misguided teachers have put  forth the 
proposition that we will evolve and go to other planets. 
They mistakenly  believe that when we advance high enough 
we will go to another planet in the material universe to 
continue our so-called spiritual evolution. That is like 
saying if you graduate from kindergarten in America you 
then go to another kindergarten in Canada or England to 
continue your education. 
95 

When we graduate from the schoolhouse of earth 
life we will continue our life in much higher realms and not 
just go to another material schoolhouse someplace in the 
same material universe. 
Now we come to the point of this lesson. So-called 
spiritual evolution does not mean changing your place in 
space. You do not change you location in space but you 
will change place in the Kingdom of the Heavens within 
you. We change place within ourselves. Contemplate 
the meaning of these words: changing place within us. 
This does not mean moving from the material heart to the 
material brain. Within us does not mean within our material 
body. When Christ said, 'The kingdom of the heavens is 
within us," he did not specify a part of the body. 
To find who we are, we must go beyond the illusions 
of space and time. We must go "within us", which really 
means entering our Soul Nature. To do this we must first 
study our personality. Now, study does not mean 
criticizing and accusing our personality. That is just your 
96 

egoism doing the criticizing to get attention -
y
our 
attention. Don't bite that bait, it is a trick.  This is very 
similar to how a child that needs attention will resort to 
getting negative attention if it can't get positive attention 
from its parents. 
Remember also, that our egoism has a strong 
masochistic side.  It likes to play the victim, the wounded 
one, the offended one and the guilty one.  It enjo
y
s being 
its own judge, jury and executioner. It does all this, distracts 
us and mislead us from proceeding in the right way.  If we 
stay on the proper course we deprive our egoism of the 
energy of our   attention and its    starts to become de­
energized. There is nothing more  frightening to our egoism 
than to be weakened and removed from power. Really, it is 
a devil in every sense of the word. 
So it is not our Self that criticizes us and places 
heavy layers of guilt on our shoulders. Our real Self is a 
completely independent Master of the Truth and gives 
comfort not criticism. 
97 

Freeing 
our sense 
of Self 
from 
our egoism 
we come 
to realize 
we are a powerful 
intelligence. 
We are then 
capable 
of knowing 
the truth 
beyond 
its illusionary 
reflections 
in time 
and 
space. 
Our 
outer 
space 
reality 
is not 
larger 
than 
our inner 
space 
reality 
and 
it is this 
inner 
reality 
we returning 
back 
home 
to. 
Returning 
back 
home 
means 
the personality 
self 
enters 
into 
Soul 
Self 
Awareness. 
This 
is the Self 
Realization 
we are aiming 
at.  It does 
not require 
any 
outward movement 
in time 
or space. 
When 
this 
does 
happen 
for you, 
you 
finally 
realize 
that 
both space 
and 
time 
are within 
you. 
Words 
cannot 
really 
explain 
this 
well; 
you 
will get the meaning 
of this 
through 
direct 
experience. 
Masters, teachers 
and 
guides 
can show 
the way 
but we are 
the ones 
that 
must 
make 
our steps 
along 
the way 
to get the 
direct 
experience. 
Really, 
the term 
Guide 
is better 
than 
the term 
Master 
or Teacher. 
Christ 
said, 
"Call 
no one 
your 
teacher 
for there 
is one 
teacher 
and 
that 
is God." 
A real 
guide 
will 
raise 
the 
98 

light of truth to brighten your way; they will take your hand 
and even walk with you for a time along this way but don't 
expect them to carry you along your way. They simply will 
not do it. You have to learn to walk this way on your own. 
So when you have this opportunity with a guide make use 
of this advantage and take your steps to find the truth. 
What is this truth? No one can tell you; you must 
find it yourself by the process of Attunement and At-One­
Ment. Once you find it, you will not be dependent on 
anything, or anyone, to tell you what the truth is.  And no 
one  will or could take that away from you. This is what 
Christ  was  saying - "Seek the truth and the truth will set 
you  free!" 
In the next lesson we will speak about the 
elementals, the emotion-thought forms and the thought­
emotion forms. We will study their nature, behavior and 
how they are stored in one of the chambers of our sub 
consciousness.

Questions 
Q. 
This 
is a question 
about 
a previous 
Virtual 
Circle 
Lesson: 
Is the 
out-of-body 
practice 
the 
same 
as the 
training 
for 
raising 
and 
lowering 
the 
vibration 
that 
we'll 
need 
when 
on the 
psychical 
plane? 
A. The 
Preliminary 
Meditation 
and 
the 
Good 
Health 
exercises 
found 
in the 
Practices 
section 
of the 
ResearchersofTruth.org 
web 
site 
are 
initial 
training 
exercises 
for 
raising 
and 
lowering 
the 
vibrations 
of your 
three 
bodies. 
Really 
all the 
practices 
train 
you 
for 
this. 
We 
also 
have 
the 
Archangel 
Attunement 
exercises 
for 
training 
to raise 
our 
vibrations 
to connect 
with 
the 
higher 
intelligences 
and 
we 
have 
a Seaside 
meditation 
which 
helps 
train 
us to lower 
our 
vibrations 
to connect 
with 
the 
nature 
kingdom. 
This 
is the 
skill 
I was 
referring 
too. 
100 

Of course an out of body experience (OBE) is a much 
greater example of that. But by practicing the mentioned 
exercises they  train you to raise your vibration by lifting 
your awareness from being centered on the material body 
and material world to the psychical body and psychical 
world and then to noetical body and noetical world. 
Visualizing the colored the balls associated with the 
preliminary exercise making them brighter, clearer and 
stronger means you are learning to raise your ,-ibrations, 
which will give you the skills to help you move consciously 
from the lower  sub-planes to higher ones in the psycho­
noetical  worlds  during an out of the body experience or 
what we call Exosomatosis. The first Exosomatosis (OBE) 
is the conscious transfer of your self-awareness from the 
material world to the psychical worlds, and the second 
Exosomatosis the conscious transfer of your self-awareness 
from the psychical worlds to the noetical worlds.

Meditation 
Feel you are completely relaxed now. 
Feel the solar plexus. 
Relax the chest. 
Relax the hands. 
Now, relax the head. 
To relax is more than just to feel being in that part of the 
body. Let go of e,·ery kind of thought. Be completely 
peaceful. Feel you are in the material body, not by tension 
but by attention. Simply be in the material body without 
tension - completely relaxed. 
Now ask yourself this question: "Who am I? What am I? I 
know myself by a name and by my habits. But am I really 
only that? I can feel that body of mine because I am living 
in it. 
Now, I know that in this body of mine, apart from my 
thoughts and my feelings, there are intelligences and 
entities working in it. The Archangel of heat, warmth, fire, 
a Michael is working. A Gabriel, Master of the liquids, 
104 

water and the blood is working. ;\ Raphael, �laster of 
ethcric vitality, electricity, magnetism, and cnc1J,')' is 
working in my body.  All the Archangels of the clements 
are all working and cooperating to give my material body 
good health. This is the work of these J\rchanh,els - the 
Archangels work in perfect Harmony with each other. 
Now, whether I feel it, know it, or not, my blood is 
circulating in my arteries, in my veins, in my materi�il brain, 
in the toes of my feet, in my fingers -everywhere. What is 
the circulation of my blood and who is doing it? Now, my 
heart is beating. As a personality it is not I who makes my 
heat beat. Who is doing it? It is the Holy Archangels and 
the Holy Spirit as supervisors. They are working 
unceasingly for me, just to prepare a material body for me. 
And, of course, they are working in my psychical body and 
in my noetical body, which I can find out and know in 
introspection. Who am I now, observing, thinking, and 
trying to understand? I am not the product of the material 
105 

body. I am Logoic. That means I am expressing self­
consciousness. 
Feel completely relaxed in the material body. Feel your 
desires and emotions at peace. Calm down all negative 
thoughts and even positive thoughts. You don't need even 
the positive thoughts now.  Feel completely calm and at 
peace. 
You can make this meditation, which is also a   prayer, when 
you need to relax completely and connect with your Self. 

Chapter4 
Mind Viruses Part One 
Our subconscious mind is composed of all of our 
Elementals - the living forms created by our thoughts and 
emotions. Most of these Elementals are what we harbor 
and project from this lifetime.   A smaller percenrage has 
been carried over from previous lifetimes. These come 
forward in this life as our predispositions, talents, lessons 
learned and lessons to be learned. 
The subconscious mind is also a general storehouse 
of vitality, which is given to us each day by the Holy Spirit. 
Metaphorically, 
it is truly 
our 
"Daily 
Br
e
ad," 
as Christ 
put 
it. 
Now 
the 
subconscious 
can 
be s
e
en in thr
ee 
parts 
(cha
mbers). 
One chamber 
is for the cr
e
ation 
of th
e 
Ele
mentals 
through 
us. 
It is that 
part 
for 
wh
e

Super-Substance

our motivations and intentions and gain their power from 
our etheric vitality. 
Also in another chamber of the subconscious is 
completely under the regulation of the Holy Spirit and Its 
Archangelic emissaries. Using the etheric vitality of this 
part of the subconscious the Archangels keep the etheric 
double of the material body in perfect health. They use the 
etheric double to build and maintain our material body. 
Now a question arises: If the etheric double of the material 
body is always in perfect health, why isn't our material body 
always in perfect health? The short answer is because, as a 
personality, we interfere with the use of the etheric vitality 
needed to maintain perfect health in our material body. In 
truth perfect health is natural - illness is unnatural. 
Let us say our daily allotment of etheric vitality is 
100 units of energy. 40 percent of this amount is needed 
each day by the Holy Spirit to build up and maintain health 
in the material body. This is for  the growth of the body, 
the regeneration of cells, digestion and other autonomic 
108 

functions. That leaves another 60 percent to be used by 
the personality. Let's say 40 percent of this amount of 
etheric  energy is used by us each day in moving about and 
doing all the things people today do. That leaves another 
20 percent extra to be used as the personality sees fit.  The 
problem is that we do not always use the 60 percent in a 
constructive way. We are always burning this daily vitality 
by our thoughts, desires, talking and acting. This means in 
creating elementals and our way of  life. So  whatever we 
do during the day we are constantly burning our allotment 
of daily vitality. There is no fixed barrier berween the 40 
percent needed by the Holy Spirit and the 60 percent at the 
disposal of the personality. 
What happens if we burn more than our allotted 60 
perce
nt? The extra 
vitality burned must come fr
om 
somewhere. Since the average person does not know how 
to collect  etheric  vitality  consciously, they are dependent on 
the daily allotment. So when they bum more than the 60 
percent it has to come from somewhere. That somewhere 
109 

is the 40 percent needed by the Holy Spirit to maintain 
good health in the body. So we are making a mistake to 
draw down the vitality needed by the Holy Spirit to 
maintain good health. This is why the material body is 
from time to time experiencing illnesses. 
Naturally, the Holy Spirit and the Archangels of the 
Elements can give more, but should they give more just 
because we as a personality over overuse our part by 
behaving in an over emotional, over mental or by 
overactive physical way?  Should a father who gives his 
child a good allowance each week give that child more if he 
wastes that allowance on foolish things? Of course not; 
but if that child spends his allowance early in the week by 
buying food for a hungry person and ask his father for 
more - it is likely most earthly fathers will give that child 
more. This is even truer of our heavenly father. If we use 
our vitality for the good of humanity he will give us more. 
So the energy supply for our service to others should not 
be limited to the reserves of our personal daily allotment 
110 

but come from the source itself. Still you must learn how 
to make that connection and tap the source. 
So the sub-consciousness is in the etheric double 
and is full of our daily allotment of energy. There is a 
connection, a passage, to that storehouse of energy used by 
us to build and empower our thought forms, our 
elementals. 
How can we participate in keeping our etheric 
double full and highly charged with this etheric vitality? 
There are two ways. One is by breathing properly. We 
have already given those exercises. The other is by using 
the subconscious to enrich  itself with that vitality. In the 
part of the subconscious mind accessed by the personality 
there is the I<.inetic, Aesthetic and Imprinting ethers, all of 
which we are using without knowing we are using them or 
even what they are. We move with the kinetic ether, we 
feel with the aesthetic ether and with the imprinting ether 
we visualize and see. In this part of the subconscious 
Ill 

mind, with these three ethers we are creating our thought 
and emotional forms, the elementals. 
In another chamber of the sub-consciousness is the 
creative ether, which is only under the control of the Holy 
Spirit and its Archangelic workers. Of course in their great 
work they are also using the kinetic, aesthetic and 
imprinting ethers too. The Holy Spirit and the Archangels 
use these ethers from this part of the sub-consciousness, so 
it is not giving any conscious sensation to the personality. 
Our personality is not noticing what they are doing with 
these ethers. The Archangels are feeling, seeing and 
knowing exactly what they are doing with all the ethers. 
They use the kinetic ether in the circulation of the blood. 
Clearly, the circulation of our blood is not in under our 
control. The Archangels are doing their work by constant, 
creative thought. 
Now there is a space between the imprinting ether 
used by the Archangels and the imprinting ether we can 
use. Can we ever bridge that space, connect the ethers to 
112 

feel and know the how the Archangels are using these 
ethers? Eventually we as good psychotherapists should 
know how to bridge this gap. 
A good researcher or a good psychotherapist should 
first develop the skills to come into conscious contact with 
the Holy Spirit & the Archangels. How can we do that? It 
is done by first studying the nature of the sub­
consciousness. \'(
1 
e should also study what is going on in 
our material  body, which brings us to the point of 
detecting their di\-ine work in our  body.  And then we can 
recognize that there are much higher intelli
ge
nces than our 
own  personality governing these great works. Then it "'ill 
start to  dawn on  us that we  must expand our knowled
ge 
and responsibility as a self, ii
,
-ing in our material body and 
to 
stop misusing our etheric double by burnin
g its

by getting angry, jealous, anxious and fearful. 
How 
will the 
personality 
learn 
all that? 
Sooner 
or 
lat
er the 
perso
nality 
must 
come 
to 
realize that 
it is

the 
for

r-substa
nce of the �find

ht 
113 

forms, 
which it is responsible for. We will learn that by 
suffering from those less than desirable elementals we 
harbor and project. So the very first thing to do is to ask 
yourself: How am I feeling now. How am I thinking now, 
how am I behaving now and most importantly, why? 
Then you should carefully observe your behavior. 
Ask yourself the question: What is this kind of behavior 
really giving me? Is it trouble, pain, or pleasure? What 
kind of pleasure is it giving? Is the fleeting pleasure I get 
worth all the trouble I went through to get it?   This needs 
concentration as we check the truth regarding our 
relationships. This means, relationships in the family, in 
the community in our work. How do we affect our 
community, our work and our family relations by our 
behavior; and equally important, how are our relations in 
our community, our work, and our family affecting us?  Are 
we experiencing pain, envy, hatred and troubles? 
What is the gain by this line of investigation? We 
begin to understand who we are and who our relations are. 
114 

Studying our relationships, we can reach a better 
understanding of what love is and what hatred is between 
two people. The most practical way of studying our 
subconscious mind is to study our own behavior. This 
means getting to know who we are, first as a personality 
because the part of the subconscious that is under our 
control is the present-day personality. The present-day 
personality is the collection of elementals we express now 
and we have created and expressed in the past. 
This means that the quality of our personality and of 
our subconscious is exactly the same as the quality of the 
elementals we harbor and express. We express these 
elementals, projecting them outward, and then they return 
back and settle  down in our sub-consciousness. Then, 
from time to time, they rise to the surface again to be re­
energizing, re-thought, re-felt and re-projected. Left 
u
nchecked 
they 
continue this life cycle and 
influ
ence us 
day 
and 
night. 
115 

Now where in our etheric double is our part of the 
sub-consciousness that we control? It is in the qualities we 
call kinetic, aesthetic and imprinting ethers and not the 
other ones controlled by the Holy Spirit. So for now we 
just need to get knowledge of the qualities we are allowed 
to use.  Then one day it will be possible to expand to study 
and know all of our sub-consciousness. Of course then it 
will not be subconscious anymore. We will have made the 
subconscious conscious. 
To do that, we must move from a theoretical 
understanding that every thought, feeling and desire is 
creating an elemental to a practical understanding of this 
process. At this point most people cannot see elementals 
but everyone can feel their influences. Eventually, you will 
be able to see them through clairvoyance, but don't assume 
that is a wonderful blessing, because when you see certain 
elementals coming from you and others they can be 
terrifying. Elementals of jealousy, hatred and suspicion are 
frightening. Do you know why it is not good to hold and 
116 

express suspicion about someone? When we haYe 
suspicion towards a person
) 
it actuall
y 
creates a strong 
elemental that influences that person. It influences that 
p
erson to do exactly what you are suspecting them of.  So 
please avoid entertaining dark suspicions about others.  It 
harms you, the other person and adds weight to the karmic 
burden you carry. 
We are all living in a common environment \Vith 
other people, each of which is living in their own particular 
way. In our study we get to know this and we get to know 
what going on in our sub conscious mind. \,'hat do we see 
outside us and  what do  we  see inside us?  Seeing outside us 
means we see all the things going on around us in our life 
and relationships. And seeing inside us means we are 
noticing what inner interest and reactions we experience 
associated with these outside things. This means 
Introspection. When we notice these outer things around 
do we feel pleasure or pain or does it create a strong desire 
in  us  to know, have and  experience the outer things? 
117 

Think for a minute. What is it within our personality 
that creates this desire to know and to have the outer 
things? 
W'hat is so important in that outer thing that 
makes us want to know and own it?  Why do we want to 
know and have it?  What for?  With this line of 
investigation we soon discover that most of our waking life 
is just expressing a desire to know, have and do.  It is not 
just in desiring things, it also in desiring to have the 
attention of others. And most desires of having are simply 
for the appeasement and satisfaction of our egoism. 
Now in our part of the sub-consciousness the 
egoism is living and just vibrating at the same rate of 
vibration as our elementals. We are studying our little self, 
which is not exactly our real Self. We have mistaken our 
self to be the sum total of the weaknesses and strengths of 
the present-day personality, but our real Self is something 
much more. It is the Spirit-Soul Self. We are that, but for 
now our attention is seriously chained to material things. 
So far we have only learned how to concentrate on one 
118 

point for knowing and receiving information and that point 
is the present-day personality. This concentration is 
mostly habitual and mechanical without full attention. 
As we said, so far we have just been concentrating 
on our personality in a habitual way, but with proper 
meditation training we learn to concentrate and observe 
more deeply. We can learn to fully fix our attention on 
anything we want to know. This has immediate benefits of 
living in a better way.  Things that have pre,�ously escaped 
our attention are now noticed.  With improved observation 
and concentration we do not make as many mistakes and 
thus find greater harmony in our life and with others. 
It was very common for people who attended a few 
of Daskalos' lesson to tell him they want to have 
Exosomatosis - conscious out of body travel. His reply to 
them was just as common. 
He would often ask, "Are you sure you are able to 
concentrate your attention on one point fully for some 
119 

determined time? Or are you drawn away by hundreds of 
other thoughts?" 
They would often reply, "How can we master our 
mind so we are not drawn off by other thoughts?" 
And Daskalos would say, "It is not your mind you 
are going to be mastering. It is just learning to close your 
self-consciousness off from your sub-consciousness so that 
you do not allow the elementals t0 cnme to the surface and 
disturb you. Don't allow them to surface at a time you do 
now want or need them." 
In that part of the sub-consciousness the elementals 
are always active, moving and wanting to come to the 
surface of your mind, which disturbs your meditation. Just 
try closing your eyes for meditation and say, "I want my 
mind to be completely empty of all thoughts" for the next 
five minutes and see what happens. You will discover the 
mission critical need for getting the ability to seal that sub­
conscious chamber off.

you to stop your observation meditation by convincing you 
something else is more important to do or think. But it 
does not matter; you as self-awareness have claimed ten 
minutes for this practice. 
In the first week of this practice you will have 
learned to observe what is coming to your mind from your 
sub-consciousness. Then for the second week of this 
practice you say, "I want my mind completely quiet, I want 
to banish all thoughts coming to my mind during this ten 
minute practice. I want complete quiet, seeing nothing and 
thinking nothing." Then we get the power to banish 
useless and troubling thoughts at will.  This is a bit more 
difficult but this leads you to self-mastery, and you cannot 
get the mastery without making the effort. This practice 
should be done for at least fifteen days. This practice is 
called Entering the Silence. It is in the silence that we 
hear the voice of God. 

A Roman 
Catholic 
Cardinal 
came to Daskalos 
and 
he praised 
the vinues 
of being silent during certain periods 
of time. 
Daskalos asked 
him, "By silence you meant not 
talking 
to others and others not ralking to you?" 
The Cardinal 
said, ''Yes. " 
Daskalos asked, 
'When 
you do that, can you also 
silence 
the thoughts 
corning 
from your subconscious?" 
The Cardinal 
said,  '1 am afraid not." 
Daskalos 
replied, 
'Then you can't call 
it the Silence." 
So we need to develop 
the art of silencing 
these 
elementals 
and not just isolating 
yourself 
in a lonely please 
where you do 
not speak 
to others and they do not speak to 
you.  The real benefit 
is not in outward 
seclusion 
but in 
being able to seclude 
your self-consciousness 
from the sub 
conscious 
chamber 
from where your elementals 
arise. 
With the successful 
completion 
of this fifteen day 
practice, 
we are in a position 
to fully concentrate 
and create 
the elementals 
we choose. 
The next exercise 
is to obser
v
e 
123 

things, store them in our mind and retrieve them perfectly 
at any time. To do this exercise we take an object, hold it 
in our  hand and concentrate on it  for five minutes. 
Concentrate on its color, its size, and its texture. Then 
close your eyes and bring that image to mind in as much 
detail as possible. Later we can then try to draw this object 
perfectly from memory. Then we repeat this practice 
every day for some time. This improves our skills in 
observation, concentration and visualization. These are 
three of the keys to the door of the Kingdom of the 
Heavens. 
We did this little training exercise with a piece of 
quartz  stone at our last workshop. We built a strong 
noetical image and implanted it into our subconscious, 
which can easily be retrieved and brought into our 
conscious mind. This image, this elemental, was built with 
the super-substance of the mind and is far more durable 
and long lasting than things we can make with our hands. 
124 

Elementals have different degrees of purity so we 
have a range of elementals from the eyiJ to the angelic 
ones. Of course the evil ones are destructiYe to us and 
others while the angelic ones are healing and beneficial to 
us and others. It is interesting to note that an elemental's 
life cycle is similar to that of a biological ,irus. The first 
stage in the  life  cycle of a biological virus or a mind virus is 
exposure. \'{/hen a person is exposed to a negatiye 
elemental say from the outside world there is no danger to 
that person unless there is something in that person with a 
similar vibration. For example, if a person who has been a 
smoker gets around people who smoke, the elementals of 
the smokers  can create an influence on that person and 
stimulate an urge in them to smoke again. It does this 
because that  person has a similar elemental in them. 
Doesn't matter if that person's elemental is inacti,•e, it can 
be reactivated and the habit of smoking can quickly reform. 
Or say a young person who never has smoked gets around 
s
mokers they will not initially  influenced, but given enough 
125 

exposure, that young person may become interested in 
trying smoking and will start. So that is the exposure 
phase. 
The next stage is penetration. This occurs when a 
biological virus penetrates the cells of the host and 
establishes an infection. The virus creates a hole in the 
host cell's membrane and releases its genetic contents in to 
the host cell. Now something similar occurs with these 
psycho-noetical mind viruses. When a person accepts the 
influence of an elemental it means it penetrates their sub­
conscious mind, takes up residency and infects it. 
Comparatively, it is as if our etheric double is like the 
membrane of the physical cell. If our etheric double is kept 
full of etheric vitality we are immune to outside penetration 
of elementals. This is just like the skin. If the skin is 
unbroken we are protected from infections but, if there is a 
break or cut in the skin, the wound opens the body up to 
viral infections. Some similar occurs with our etheric 
double. 
126 

When it comes to elementals penetrating and taking 
up residency in our subconscious mind the penettation of 
the protective membrane of the etheric double comes from 
the inside. What does that mean? Let's say you work for a 
company and you completely depend on your paycheck for 
your sustenance. One day a co-worker tells you the 
company is in financial trouble and plans to lay off many 
employees. Before you heard those thoughts you were 
feeling safe and comfortable. The moment you hear that 
your employer is going to  fire people, you feel concern and 
that may escalate into  fear. It is like  that inner fear pokes a 
hole in your etheric double from the inside allowing the 
elemental, the thought form of the co-worker, to enter you 
mind and take up residency in your sub-consciousness. 
That is the penetration phase. 
The next phase is the replication phase. Once the 
biological virus has penetrated the host cell, it takes control 
of the host cell using the cells resources to make copies of 
its self. Similarly elementals go through a replication 
127 

process gaining access to your etheric resources to prolong 
their life in you. This means we give etheric vitality to the 
elemental by feeling it, thinking on it and acting upon it. 
When we do that we are re-energizing, releasing and 
projecting the elemental out into the psycho-noetical 
atmosphere. Then as Christ said it returns back home to 
the one who projected it with seven more of its kind. 
This is the final phase, the release phase, the phase 
where the virus is freed to infect again and the cycle 
continues. All viruses (biological viruses, mind viruses as 
well as computer  viruses) follow these basic four phases -
Exposure, Penetration, Replication, and Release. 
We all know how many times we can brood and turn 
over troubling thoughts and emotions in our mind. Every 
time we do this we project out the elemental, it comes back 
with seven more. These seven enter the seven etheric gates 
or chakras and form together as a group elemental. 
So it is easy to see how fixed ideas and OCDs are 
created. By the law of repetition they can become 
128 

monstrous group elementals and like the virus that takes 
control of the host cell, the mind virus can become so large 
they can take control of the host personality. The results 
are crippling OCDs, insanity and in some cases suicide. Or 
like  those accounts in the Bible, some people become 
"demon possessed." Now these are just the human nature 
demons, which means the human created elementals - the 
dark and destructive emotional-thought forms .  These are 
not the true  demons, which are the elementals of the fallen 
angels. The Archangels prevent the true demons from 
possessing a human being, an animal or a plant but humans 
can be influenced by the true demons.  Since man creates 
the  human in nature demons they are responsible for them 
and thus face the consequences for creating or re,�talizing 
these human in narure demon elementals. 
So the danger is in allowing these elementals to make 
us their slave and them to become the master. Look at 
what is going on all around us with all the dolent conflicts 
and wars. What do you think causes of all these things? 
129 

Elementals of aggression, hostility and hatred are being 
built and empowered by tens of thousands of people so 
their affect is great. 
\X'hcn we create or re,�talize an elemental what 
actually happens? We create a limng form subconsciously, 
without realizing it.  So the elemental gets a form, with 
shape, color and purpuse but we also create an aura, an 
etheric component for that elemental. The power of an 
elemental is in its aura and it is greatly strengthened by the 
law of repetition as we mentioned before. 
After the replication phase a biological mrus we 
come to the final stage called shedding. Once the mrus has 
taken  control of the host cell, depletes its resources by 
making copies of itself, the copies of the virus are then 
shed or released to go and find more host cells and the 
virus' life cycle process stans anew. 
With mind virus or elementals, something similar 
occurs. We can easily see this in the collecti,·e family 
elementals. These collectiYe family elementals must pass 
130 

down to successive generations in order prolong their life. 
For examples, we see many cases of a group elemental of 
anger and hostility in a family line. :\faybe the 
grandmother or grandfather had a bad temper and he or 
she on occasion would physically beat their child. We see 
the child grows up  infected \\;th a bad  temper and will 
physically beat their child too. Then, the  child in the next 
generation grows up infected with ,;olent, ill-tempered 
elementals but maybe they do not physically beat their child 
but psychological beat them down. So the family 
elementals can morph and find different express.ions but 
continues to be hosted in the lineage of the family. 
Today we are speaking about the negati,·e elementals 
the process works  the same for the positi,·e ones but, in all 
cases, a collecti,·e family elemental must find a new host in 
the  next generation to prolong its life. l" nforrunately the 
negative elementals create a psycho-noetical heredity that 
will continue until someone in the family "-akes up and 
break the chain of transmission. This is process is 
131 

mentioned in the bible where it says the Sins of  the Father 
are passed down for generations. So that is something 
of how the viruses of the subconscious mind work. 
In the next lesson we will learn more about the 
elementals and how to construct powerful thought-desire 
elementals to improve our life and help others. 
132 

Questions 
Q.  The Holy Spirit is the channel for Creativity. Creativity 
is part of the Holy Spirit realm. But we create our 
Elementals mostly subconsciously. So is the creation of 
our  elementals not related to the Creati,ity of the Holy 
Spirit or the Creative Ether? 
A.  Humankind has been deprived of the Creative Ether so 
when the personality is creating elementals, they are not 
using  the creative ether - Thank God. Yet the elementals 
are  a creation, something created from the ]\find Super 
Substance and so they are living ... they are not Life, but 
they have a living existence. Whereas the creati,it
y 
of the 
Holy Spirit and  the Holy Archangels is Life and so the 
Elementals created by the Archangels, these are the plants 
and  the animals, can reproduce more of their species. But 
an elemental created by a human cannot create brand new 
elementals. These kinds of elementals can and do combine 
133 

with other elementals, they can collect and form into larger 
groups but they cannot reproduce all by themselves - for 
that they need a human. If they could reproduce 
themselves our world would have been overrun and 
destroyed long ago. 
Q.  When we do healing work for someone, after 
concentrating to make a strong elemental for healing, we 
have to forget and release to give it time to work on that 
person. But if it is for ourselves (in self-healing), do we 
need to stop making this healing elemental for ourselves 
and release it? 
A. It does not matter if the healing elemental is for us or
somebody else it must be released to give it time to 
work. So if you are building a self-healing type of 
elemental you can do it each day at the same time for five 
to ten minutes but then you should release it, which means 
do not think about it at all until the desi
gn
ated time the 
134 

next day. Then you can re-vitalize again. But only do this 
for fifteen days maximum and then completely release it_ 
don't continue doing it for months. 
In this process you are using visualization, which is the 
language of the divine, and you are asking God the father 
and the holy archangels for a specific healing. We do not 
want to be like impatient children incessantly begging for 
what we want. We are not beggars but sons and daughters 
of God who have the right to ask their father for what they 
truly need. But ask in the attirude of a child of God and not 
as a hungry beggar. 
Q.  Sometimes I feel like I am being attacked by elementals 
in the form of fearful thoughts and feelings. I cannot tell if 
they are coming from my sub consciousness or if someone 
else is sending these to me subconsciously. 
A.  If they are your own unwanted elementals or unwanted 
elementals from someone else, the remed
y 
follows the 
135 

same procedure. When a negative elemental, call it a 
human in nature devil, makes it approach it can feel like we 
are being attacked. So the approach
/ 
attack is  first phase. 
If  we do not engage with it, which means don't even start 
to think about it  or feel it  for more than a minute, then we 
can dismiss
/ 
de-energize it more easily at this point. We 
will not be all that bothered by it. 
Engagement is the second step. When you let a negative 
thought or feeling in and start engaging with it you can lose 
control and then the thought starts turning over and over 
in your head and it is hard to stop. Dance with a devil and 
the devil always ends up leading. Engaging with a negative 
thought
/ 
feeling contaminates you in heart, mind and over 
time even the health of your material body. 
The next thing that happens if you do not stop is some 
kind of action. Maybe you respond to it, like mistakenly 
deciding this negative elemental is the truth and you should 
or must act on it. If you act on it you become more

entangled and greatly strengthen the elemental while 
weakening you.  The more you feel, think and act, on a 
negative elemental, the larger and more powerful it 
becomes until it reaches the last phase. The last phase is a 
kind of possession where the elemental, which has now 
become a large group elemental, can gain control of the 
personality form time to time.  Left unchecked this  can 
eventually ruin  and cripple the personality \vith  fixed ideas, 
OCDs and in some cases insanity, which can lead to 
suicide. 
As you become more aware you can learn to dis-energize 
the fearful and unwanted elementals when they are weakest 
and that is during the approach/ attack phase. But be aware 
the cunning elementals know what you are planning 
because they  have a certain degree of intelligence in them. 
And they will adjust their approach according to your 
plans. One trick they try is to make their approach as you 
fall asleep at night or wake in the morning. When you start 
137 

to come to wakefulness you can be more vulnerable and 
affected by unwanted Elementals. 
The phases of the Elementals are: 
Approach/ attack phase 
Engagement phase 
Taking action phase 
Possession phase 
What about loving elementals, call them human in nature 
angels, which seek to benefit and uplift you? 
They follow a similar set of phases. The first is again the 
approach phase. In this phase you may get an uplifting idea 
or inspiration. The second is the engagement phase where 
we start to listen to it and accept the idea. Then comes the 
action phase, where we decide to act upon the inspiration 
of the human in nature angel. Now we are building on 
this positive elemental and it too grows into a larger and 
stronger group elemental. But this group elemental 
becomes a powerful ally in your life influencing you 
138 

towards the good.  The final phase in this case   is not an 
unhealthy possession but an unrestricted positive 
manifestation, an out picturing of Love. 
It is said that we pass through life with a spirit of good and 
a spirit of evil both trying to influence us.  It is not all that 
difficult to tell the difference. Because the spirit of good 
brings you comfort and strengthens you.  And the spirit of 
evil offers confusions and worries to weaken you.  So the 
power is in our hands which one we listen to. So be 
prepared: The one we chose to listen to is the one we will 
believe.

Meditation 
Close your eyes and relax completely. 
Feel the head in a lovely golden light. 
Feel the whole head is in a ball of golden light. 
The light is in the head and one foot around the head. 
See that your head is in that ball of golden light, so it will 
radiate like the sun. 
You can see that around the heads of saints in the paintings 
in Greek churches. 
We don't want to use kinetic ether right now - so no 
movement. 
Feel the whole head in that light, using the aesthetic ether. 
(Remember, to feel it doesn't mean to concentrate 
stubbornly in the head, because this will cause headaches, 
by increased blood circulation in the head. That is not what 

Sim
ply 
feel 
your 
head 
gently, 
without 
any 
effort, 
and with 
imprinting ether see the golden color. 
You are cleaning the mental body - your noetical body. 
Now suggest to your sub conscious mind: "I want peace. I 
want to use my mind with reason." 
Just make these thoughts. 
Notice now, that when you enter in  the head in this way 
and start to think, you will feel the heart. Try it! 
What does it mean when you feel the heart? 
It means  that  the  Logos is ready to help you. 
The  seat of the  Logos is in the heart. So the time you are 
concentrated in the head, noticing the heart, you may see 
the six-pointed star in the chest without even trying to 
form it  yourself. 
You will feel it and see it, because the six-pointed star is 
real, it is not something like an elemental, but it is a real 
sy
mbol. 
141 

Calmly and without any effort, see this ball of light in the 
head and around the head. See it and feel it, use 
observation and the aesthetic ether. 
Then say in your mind: "I will be the master of my 
thoughts and emotions. My thoughts and my 
emotions will be under my command and reason." 
But we do not want increased circulation in the head from 
over concentration. 
Concentrate in the head but without any effort. 
When you do the exercise, you might feel that the six­
pointed star will be created in the place of the heart. 

Chapters 
Mind Viruses Part Two 
I want to tell you a little story about a student from 
the Vienna Circle of the 20'" century philosopher. Frege 
Wittgenstein. The student commented to Wittgenstein 
how stupid it was for Europeans in the past to have 
thought that the Sun was rotating around the Earth when, 
today we all know it is the Earth that is revolving around 
the Sun. 
Wittgenstein replied, "I agree, but can you imagine 
how it would have looked if the Sun were really rotating 
around the Earth?" 
Well, it 
would 
look exactly the 
same.  The 
point 
o
f 
the 
story is: 
You see 
what your knowle
dge 
tells 
yo

y
ou

and 
what you think 
r

r

that, in everything 
you

o
u 
k
n
ow
. 
This 
mea
ns that when what you 
know 
change
s
, y
our 
143 

reality changes. In other words, your reality will only 
change when your knowledge changes. 
This is true for you individually as well as for the 
race as a whole. We as personalities all are what we know 
today. What we knew in previous years is different from 
what we know today. All through our life, every time our 
view of our reality changed, we changed with it and 
something was created that helped make us what we are 
today. The something that was created is the elementals -
the thoughts and emotions that form our personality and 
our personal view of reality. 
The revelation of elementals and the detailed 
information on how they determine a person's place in this 
world and the next is one of the most game-changing 
pieces of knowledge a personality could discover. Of 
course enlightened mystics and teachers in all past times 
spoke a bit about these, but lately much more has been 
revealed and systematized about them than ever before, 
making it possible for anyone to use this knowledge to 
144 

ch
ang
e his 
or 
her reality and 
live a 
happier 
more 
satisfy
ing 
lif
e. 
In a previous lesson we were discussing closing the 
door to our subconscious mind so  that the elementals 
stored in the subconscious do not rise to the surface and 
disturb our concentrarion and meditations. We also spoke 
about the training exercise of concentration on one object, 
storing it in memory as a  whole image and retrie,�ng it 
perfectly. This is a basic skill needed for our practices. 
As you advance, you will leam to fix your attention, 
not just on one object or point, but upon two points at the 
same 
time. 
This 
does 
not 
mean 
fixing 
your 
attention 
on 
one 
object 
then 
on 
the 
second 
object 
and 
then 
back 
again 
to the 
first object. You can learn how to 
hold 
your 
atte
ntion 
on 
both 
objects 
at the 
same 
time 
with 
the 
same 
de
gr
ee of fo
cus. 
Try it sometime with two different things in a room 
you are in. See them both in the room for some time and 
t
hen close your eyes and see them in your mind but make 
145 

sure you keep the distance between them accurate. The 
tendency is, when you close your eyes, you see them near 
each other but want to learn how to create the idea of 
distance and space when we visualize. This means we must 
learn what space is  in the fourth dimension. So just keep 
the distance as you see it with your eyes open. 
If you are not able to keep the distance of two 
objects just a few feet apart, you will not be able to hold 
your attention on two place miles apart and concentrating 
know what is  going on in the distant places. Without 
learning to master the ability to fully concentrate in a 
distant place and see it properly, we cannot claim to know 
for sure what is going on in that distance place. So it is 
back to the Golden keys of Concentration and 
Observation. These are the needed skills we must learn. 
You have to master your mind and train your 
personality to examine and know what the personality really 
is. That is  the first stage. Gradually you will start living 
more fully and knowing yourself, as a personality, much 
146 

better. Before this point, you were living without realizing 
who you were as a personality. Remember, the personality 
is the sum total of what you call the conscious and the 
subconscious mind. And the subconscious mind along 
with the conscious mind is like an iceberg. Only about 20 
percent of an iceberg is visible above the water line.  The 
other 80 percent is not seen because it is under the surface 
of the water. Similarly what we know of our mind is really 
just the 20 percent that is the conscious part. The other 80 
percent of our mind is subconscious and not so known to 
us. 
So we srudy and know our self as a personality and 
later we will come to know our Self as the Soul. If we do 
not 
come to  know ourselves as a present-day personalit
y 
we should not expect we would ever know our Soul Self. 
At first we study objects like we discussed before, then we 
study and  know our personality. We do this by 
conce
ntration, but who is the one that 
is 
using 
the 
tool 
of 
concentration? 
147 

Can we get help with this effort?  Yes, the Holy 
Spirit will notice that our under developed personality is 
making an effort to know itself and mature. We have to 
demonstrate our sincerity and make a steady effort to 
wake up, and then the Holy Spirit helps us with our effort 
to awaken. Of course our personality thinks that it is 
awake already but it is not.  It is still slumbering in a semi­
conscious dreamlike state.  So we train our personality to 
be alert, observe and meditate L�,ter. Then we come to 
the real   meaning of meditation. 
From the view point of the personality, meditation 
means to steadily hold our attention on one point at first, 
seeing it, know it through observation, learning more and 
more of its qualities. This means we initially fix our 
attention on an object around us see it clearly, close our 
eyes and create the form in the proper size, texture and 
color using the imprinting ether and then going deeper and 
deeper and enter into the meaning of it.  How do we enter 
into the meaning of the object? 
148 

Here is an example of an exercise we do and what it 
can lead to.  Take a seed like a grain of wheat in the palm 
of your hand. Touch it with the fingers of the other hand 
and feel it solid.  Touch it and see it for a time.  Then put it 
aside.  Now, close your eyes and create an etheric hand 
with your creative thought. See that seed in your etheric 
hand and feel that seed as solid.  We are using 
concentration and also the aesthetic ether of the 4"' 
dimensional world to feel.  Feel the seed as solid.  Now we 
start a   creative thought type of meditation. 
See the rich fertile soil, and your hand digging a 
small hole for the seed.  See yourself purring the seed in the 
soil and covering it with dirt.  Now see yourself giving that 
little seed water and the sunlight warming the soil and seed. 
Sit there with it and see it start to grow. First, see it in the 
soil sending lirtle white roars deeper into the earth.  Then, 
see the seed sending a small green shoot up through the 
soil and bursting into the sunlight. Remember, this is a 
concentration meditation so you must not allow other 
149 

thoughts and images to come to your mind during this 
practice. See the green shoots growing very slowly-don'
t 
be in a hurry. See the little tiny plant gradually growing 
and growing. The small plant is growing in to a stalk of 
wheat and the head coming ripe for harvest. See it being 
harvested. Finally, take a wheat seed from this harvest and 
put it in your hand and touch it feeling it solid. Now stop 
the meditation. 
It is possible for a person who never saw wheat 
grow physically to do this exercise and by attunement and 
entering in to the nature of the seed and see it correctly go 
through the successive stages of growth. This is real 
creative meditation. 
There have been many accounts coming out of India 
about Hindu masters who can take an actual seed, 
physically plant and water it then meditate on the seed. 
This means they enter into the nature of the seed and have 
the seed within them. Then they can make the seed grow 
and people around them will really see the seed grow. It 
150 

takes some hours to accomplish but they can make the seed 
grow to maturity and produce fruit. Then the master will 
give you that fruit and you can eat it.  The Hindu masters 
are able to do it by the same exercise we just spoke about. 
Once, a serious scientist came to see Daskalos in the 
1980s. He had been to India and had this experience with 
a Hindu master and even ate the fruit produce bv this 
meditation. So he came and asked Daskalos how such an 
amazing thing possible. 
Daskalos said it was possible in two ways. One way 
is the way we just described above where it takes as many 
as seven or eight hours. When it takes that long it means 
the master made the real seed grow. However, it the entire 
event only took five minutes; then the master had the 
witnesses believe they  had seen it grow by creating a 
hypnotic state in the witnesses. This scientist however had 
seen it unfold over  many  hours so it was a real event and 
not  hypnotism. 
151 

There 
are other 
accounts 
where 
a Hindu 
or Sufi 
Fakir 
(a Fakir 
is an ascetic) 
is sitting 
with 
a group 
of people 
around 
him. 
He has a rope 
and a young 
boy and throws 
one end of the rope 
up in the air and it stays. 
Then 
the boy 
c
limbs 
up the rope. 
This 
is done 
with projection 
- a  type 
of group 
hypnotism. 
There 
have 
been 
some 
that have 
taken 
photographs 
of the boy climbing 
the rope 
and were 
disappointed 
to see that when 
the film was developed 
all it 
showed 
was the Fakir 
with a boy sitting 
next to him and 
the rope 
coiled 
on the ground. 
So like the story 
of the 
blond 
magus 
I told before, 
the Fakir 
was able to 
project 
what 
he wanted 
his audience 
to see. 
So this was a fake and 
did not really 
happen. 
Think 
about 
what 
these 
Fakirs 
are able to do.  They 
are able to convince 
audiences, 
at will, to believe 
the boy 
really climbed 
the rope. 
That 
in itself 
is an amazing 
ability
, 
but not put to the highest 
good. 
These 
things 
are possible, 
but we should 
be careful 
how we use the skills 
acquired 
as 
we advance. 
So many 
people 
are suffering 
in the world 
152 

today. The same effort the same amount of etheric vitality 
it takes to produce phenomena like this and impress people 
could have been used to cure a lame person. 
So back to the lesson, we were discussing an 
important  difference between the Hindu systems and our 
system for the Research Of Truth. Many of the Hindu 
masters do not want to interfere with the Karma of people. 
Of course we are not like Christ who can instantly 
eliminate someone's karma but we are allowed to alleviate 
karma to the permissible point. Alleviate is from the Latin 
and means, "to lift up-to lighten." Too often Hindu and 
other  masters  prefer not to try to even try to help change 
the Karma of a  person and prefer to show phenomena to 
amaze forei
gn
ers instead. 
The point is that when we are able to use higher 
faculties of our mind we can do things we could ne,·er 
imagine now but for the love of humanity use the mind to 
become a psychical or mental healer and not a magician 
just performing phenomena to impress others. Really it  is  a 
153 

curse to use the Divine gift of the mind for magic. It is 
certainly not allowed in our system. The masters in this 
lineage "'ill intervene if you do. 
So we should learn to master the mind - to learn to 
use it properly. We must develop our skills of 
concentration, observation and meditation. We must learn 
to keenly observe what is really going on.  This means we 
must penetrate into the relative truth of it.  We then learn 
to ascend the ladder of relative truth towards the absolute 
truth. The absolute truth is not in the illusionary material, 
psychical or noetical worlds. We must start with the 
relative truth found in these worlds to understand 
something of the circumstances and things occurring all 
around us.  We do this by developing the skills of 
concentration, meditation and especially observation. 
This is done so we can develop our ability to use the 
Super-Substance of the Mind, in is various degrees to help 
ourselves and others, not to show a miraculous 
phenomenon. As Daskalos often said, there is only one 
154 

real 
mira
cle 
and 
that 
is Life. 
Llfe 
itself 
is 
a 
miracle 
and 
not 
p
heno
mena
. 
Maybe some of you are practicing psychotherapists 
and you will have noticed you have varying degrees of 
success. When you are not fully concentrated and a bit 
distracted or absent-minded you can do very little. Of 
course it is not you doing the healing it is the Holy Spirit, 
but to do our part in cooperating with the Holy Spirit we 
have to be fully concentrated to be successful. We must 
have full attention and use observation
. 
We must express 
using our psychical body to see the results we intend. 
Seeing the results, means to have the results of curing the 
patient. 
What is needed is to train in order to make q
u
alit
y 
thought-forms: real healing elementals. In doing this work 
you need to live fully and feel fully that you are present for 
this work. 
What is this training? First you train to be able to 
fill your hands with etheric vitality. Many are using their 
hands for massage and healing but they are doing it mostly 
155 

subconsciously. But doing this consciousl
y 
gteatly 
empowers your effort. So we need to practice seeing and 
feeling your hands full of energy. 
Those who would follow this branch of study should 
practice every day for five minutes. Five minutes a day is 
enough. The exercise is in the  Esoteric  Practices book and 
goes like this: Put one of you hands on a table with a white 
cloth and feel being in the hand. Shut the door to the sub­
consciousness as we spoke of in this lesson so that no 
thoughts or distractions come to bother you during this 
five-minute exercise. Feel being in the hand and move the 
fingers a bit. Then with your though, using the imprinting 
ether, see you hand full of white light. 
After a few minutes you will start to feel something 
in your hand. Your hand may feel heavy, full of blood or 
tingle - this is good as it is filling with etheric energy.  Feel 
it and continue for a full five minutes. Feel it like that but 
also see that hand full of bright white light. Now we use 
the power of the subconscious mind. Order your 
156 

subconscious, because your subconscious does not reason; 
it just obeys your orders and suggestions. It obe\'s your 
autosuggestions and the suggestions you accept from 
others. Order your sub-consciousness by saying: I practice 
this exercise and now my hand will be full of enerb'Y any 
time I want. In time you will not need to do the exercise 
to fill you hand with power when you work with a patient. 
It will be surprising to you to discover that when you are 
using your hands for helping others, it will be full of energy 
just like you suggested to your subconscious mind. 
We know that a suggestion like this creates and 
elemental. Does that suggestion become a subconscious 
mind virus? Yes,  but  this elemental is a beneficial one. 
We all  know about the dangerous biological viruses but 
there are  also beneficial biological viruses. In  past centuries 
the  Smallpox  virus killed so many people and they were 
frantically looking for a cure. At the same time the 
Cowpox  Virus  was  common in the land. lvWkmaids got the 
Cowpox virus from milking cows  and it made red blisters 
157 

on their hands but it was not fatal like the Smallpox virus 
sometimes was. In the late 1700s, Smallpox was the 
world's most feared disease and it was rampant in England. 
It 
was noticed that those who had the Cowpox virus did 
not seem to get Smallpox.  One day an English farmer 
named Jestly got the idea to simply injecting the Cowpox 
virus into someone and then exposed them to the Smallpox 
virus to see if this could prevent contracting Smallpox. 
Obviously no one wanted to exposed to Smallpox virus but 
somehow he managed to convince his trusting wife to let 
him injected the Cowpox virus into her and then expose 
her to Smallpox several times to see what would happen. 
Can you imagine how that conversation went? Luckily for 
his wife it worked fabulous and so the technique spread. 
They called this immunization a vaccine. In fact the word 
vaccine derives from Latin and means "From Cows." 
In a somewhat similar way we too can use certain 
kinds mind viruses to produce beneficial results to 
eliminate destructive mind viruses. We can "vaccinate" 
158 

ourselves and others with positive sub-conscious mind 
viruses and produce real cures. We can call these positive 
mind viruses, suggestions when we implant them in others 
or auto suggestions when we plant them in our own sub 
consciousness. They are constructive elementals that work 
to fulfill their purpose. 
To do this work consciously and not subconsciously 
it takes  practice to develop the necessary skill using Etheric 
Vitality. When you touch a patient with your hands, 
etheric vitality flows from your hand into the body of the 
patient who needs and wants it.  So we need to train 
ourselves by the exercises given in this system. Without the 
proper exercises we will not be able to develop the skills to 
do this work consciously. These exercises are more 
valuable than you realize at the moment. 
When the etheric vitality transfers into the body of a 
patient, you still have to direct it in the body. That means 
the  energy is obeying you in the body of the patient. At 
159 

first it  this happens subconsciously. They with practice you 
get the skill of doing it  consciously. You get the skill of 
entering in the body of the patient and find out what you 
can do inside their body. Of course this take time and 
practice but, with steady effort, we will be able to do much 
with our etheric hands. 
You will notice statues in India of gods and 
goddesses with many sets of arms. All those hands 
symbolize etheric hands that you can develop and use like 
you use your material hands. You cannot put your material 
hands inside the body of a patient, but you can put your 
etheric hands in their body. If permitted; you can use these 
hands to dematerialize a dangerous rumor. 
The process is this: You put your etheric hands in 
the body and feel being in the body using aesthetic ether. 
Then you make the bone semi-solid and dissolve what need 
to be removed using a higher state of the etheric vitality. 
Of course that is easier said than done. 
160 

I have witnessed Daskalos do this first hand. One 
day a fellow came with a badly curved spine. After a short 
Stoa Lesson on healing day, the fellow came forward to 
Daskalos.  Daskalos had him remove his shirt and you 
could see his curved spine. I was sitting immediately to 
Daskalos' left and another student was sitting on my left so 
we could both see and touch the spine. As Daskalos ran 
his hands up and down the spine, he was explaining the 
process he was doing.  First he said I must make the spine 
soft by semi-dematerializing it.  He allowed us to touch it, 
proving it was no longer a hard bone but more like soft 
cartilage. Then, with his physical and etheric hands, he 
moved the  spine  into a straight position and announced he 
would re-solidify the  spine in the straight position. 
This 
took about 
ten  minutes 
and then the man stood 
up 
healed 
of 
curvat
ure of the spine. 
\\\ben 
Daskalos

d, in 
an authoritative 
voice 
he

ced to 
the 
stu
dent 
and 
myself, 
"And 
you will do this t
oo."  He 
alread
y 
161 

had two students on Cyprus who could do this but he really 
wanted more students to learn this skill. 
You may ask in this regard what about the role of 
will power. Does it take a strong will power? Daskalos 
would say, ''Will power is will power." No one has a weak 
will power. It is just a matter of getting interested in 
learning how to exercise your will power. We all have a 
strong will power once we decide and want to use it.  Just 
think about the strong will power you use to get something 
you ardently desired. So what is needed is exercising our 
will power, by getting keenly interested and deciding what 
you are supposed to do.  Then you will see that a sttong 
will power comes to surface. 
So this is the message for psychotherapist and 
wellness workers. Really get interested in what you are 
doing with your patients and decide to do it well.  But you 
will need one more qualification to be really effective in 
your work and that is real love. Love the people who come 
to you whether you know them or not.  We cannot have 
162 

ene
mies. 
What 
we call enemies 
are just people 
who are 
more 
in need 
of our love 
than  our 
friends. 
We 
should 
not be influenced 
if the people 
coming to 
us 
behave 
like an 
enemy 
or a friend. 
We ha,·e 
to 
transce
nd 
that 
conclition, 
get the decision 
to help 
and do our 
work 
with 
real love 
in 
our heart. 
Then 
you will have 
good 
results 
but, to have these kinds of good results, we must love 
everyone. If you are a psychotherapist or wellness worker 
and you feel you like some of the people and not others 
then you should give this work up. If you hold this kind 
of  sense of separation in you, you will not become a good 
psychotherapist. 
If 
you have 
this kind 
of feeling 
you can use the 
power 
of  the 
subconscious 
mind 
to overcome 
it. 
You 
start 
by convincing 
your 
subcon
scious 
that every 
human 
being 
is yourself, 
or at least 
your 
brother 
and 
sister. 
In this 
wa
y you will 
have 
greater 
successes. 
In this healing 
work 
the
re is no 
such  thing 
as choosing 
whom 
we 
will 
treat. 
163 

You 
must be sincere with yourself and ask: Do I 
really feel that I like and love everyone coming to me? 
There are many people who radiate a kind of energy and 
their beha,�or that makes them unlikeable. It makes those 
around these people uncomfortable and a feeling of dislike 
starts to form. We have already ordered our subconscious 
not to judge others as good or bad and to see all as a 
brother or sister. When this order sticks in our sub 
conscious mind
, 
it means we have been vaccinated and are 
immune to the negative vibrations of such people. 
So get this decision and train your subconscious to 
love all.  In this way we will not be influence by our egoism 
to dislike some and favor others. We must learn to love 
and serve people no matter how they behave. This is the 
Fifth Promise of a Research of Truth: "To love and serve 
my fellow human beings sincerely from the depths of my 
heart and Soul no matter what their behavior may be 
towards me.,, 
164 

Sometimes when things go too far; that love and 
service means not being around them if  it  makes the 
situation worse. This is  one of the Buddhist vows - if you 
cannot help, then your aim is to do no  harm. So we 
accomplish this great goal of not looking at people and life 
through the filters of liking and disliking by starting to  live 
by principles. So when we meditate or pray we tell our 
subconscious and therefore our personality: "I will  live  by 
principles now  and  not be influenced by the thoughts and 
emotions of people around me." Christ gave us the 
principles to live by when he said we should love our 
neighbor as our self and to love our enemies. But it is  not 
enough just to  accept these principles we must live by them 
in thought, word and deed. Then we will be empowered. 
What 
about 
our 
emotions? 
We 
also 
clean 
our 
emotio
ns when 
we 
live 
by  principles. 
Our 
emotions 
are 
gett
ing 
the 
color 
and 
shades 
of our 
egoism. 
And 
we clean 
the 
emotio
ns and 
the 
thoughts 
by the 
princip
les 
we live  by. 
T
his 
means 
using 
reason. 
But we 
will 
not 
mea
sure 
165 

reason by the standards of our self-interest but in the 
light of our principles. 
Even if you acquire all these skills and powers we 
teach about, you will not have the same results in all 
people. You may treat a crippled man and that man may 
start to walk. However, you may treat a less damage body 
and you will not see any results at all. Do not give up. Try 
three times and after the third time if you do not see the 
results - Stop. It means it is not the right time. It means it 
is not the will of God for the results to come now - maybe 
they will come later. 
When people come for healing-physical,  emotional 
or mental what is the Researcher's motto? We promise 
nothing and we disclose nothing because we are not the 
ones to decide. It is the Will of God. 
In the next lesson we will examine how the practice 
of Introspection is used as a powerful tool for cleansing 
our sub consciousness of undesirable elementals, freeing us 
to experience higher states of consciousness.

Questions 
Q.  What is the relationship between elementals, Karma 
and the present personality? 
A. We have said our personality is the sum total of our 
elementals that are wrapped around a Ray of our Spirit 
Soul. These elementals have a big range of purity and so 
we find that personalities have a big range of purity too. 
When we live sub-consciously we are allowing the habit 
energies of these elementals to be expressed without 
checking them first. Living sub-consciously, we create a 
great deal of karma, without realizing. Maybe it is not evil 
karma but it is still Karma and it must be balanced. 
Karma is a law, the law of what you sow, so shall you reap. 
It is simply the universal law of cause and effect. So any 
expression of our thoughts, desires, feelings, words and 
actions, initiate a cause and effect sequence. The karmic 
effect we reap is always perfectly proportional to the 
168 

cause we sowed that created the effect. Our expressions 
and thus the elementals of our expressions create Karma 
and that Karma can be returned to us also via elementals. 
For example,  say a person has a bad feeling arise in them 
about another person and says some harsh words to them. 
That process was driven by the elementals and it creates 
karma for the person who spoke harshly. Now when that 
karma returns to the person, it may come back in the same 
manner. Someone may have and ill feelings and speak 
harshly to them too.  So again it is an elemental of ill 
feelings spoken harshly that delivers the karma back to the 
original person. As Christ said you cannot even give a cup 
of water without it being returned to you. This is a vecy 
simple analogy of a very, very complex process but it gives 
some idea of the relationship between elementals, karma 
and the personality. 
169 

Q. Since "each elemental owns a psychic and noetical 
counterpart which inherits the intentions of its creator", 
could it be that elementals may also carry a signature­
imprint of the creator's psyche's desire for evolving? 
What I mean is, do you imagine that elementals are looking 
to evolve and be liberated too? 
A. As we said most elementals are desire based elementals 
and their force is more of an effect of devolution on the 
personality. But we also do have noble thought based 
elementals, which do have the intention of helping us and 
others evolve spiritually. But the purpose of an elemental's 
entire existence is to fulfill the aim it was created for. So 
even in this kind the intent of evolving is not for the 
elemental but its creator. 
However, Daskalos sometimes experimented with the 
human in nature demon elementals he removed from 
people to see if he could get them to change. He had 
complete control over elementals and had on occasion 
170 

removed 
hostel 
ones 
from 
people 
and 
then 
rather 
than 
de­
energize 
it and 
send 
it back 
into 
the 
Cosmic 
Consciousness, 
he  tried 
reprogramming 
it and  giving 
it a new 
directive 
to 
do some 
good. 
In this 
way 
he repurposed 
the 
negative 
elemental 
to do good. 
For example 
he took 
a particularly 
hostile 
one 
off 
a  person 
and 
then 
reprogrammed 
it to 
protect 
his 
flowers 
outside 
his 
front 
door. 
But 
initially 
that 
did 
not 
go so well 
because 
the 
elemental 
started 
to carry 
out 
its new 
purpose 
as a guardian 
but 
with 
some 
of its 
original 
hostility. 
So when 
a student 
coming 
to Daskalos' 
front  door  got 
too 
close 
to the 
flowers, 
the 
elemental 
attacked 
them. 
So Daskalos 
had 
to work 
with 
it some 
more 
to get 
it to guard 
without 
hostility. 
So in this case 
we 
can 
see  that 
elementals 
can 
be changed, 
improved 
and 
in 
that 
way 
maybe 
we 
can say 
it "evolved", 
but 
not 
by the 
elemental's 
own 
effort. 
171 

Q. Could you please say what approach and methods are 
appropriate for sending contemplative elementals in 
specific situations where one does not   know the people, 
region or culture etc.  A review would be beneficial 
especially at this time where many changes are occurring in 
the world. 
A. There is growing recognition of communal prayer for 
affecting positive change over a cen.in segment of the 
population. Trials have been done that have proven; that if 
a portion of a population prays in unison a sharp change in 
behavior can be measured in that population. This was 
tried in the crime capital of the America, Washington D.C. 
in July 1993, when crime increases as the temperature gets 
increases. Over a weekend 4000 people prayed collectively 
for the crime rate ro go down in this city of over 1.5 million 
people.  They hoped it might drop by 20%.  But it actually 
dropped by 25% and the local police and FBI confirmed 
172 

this drop. Such is the power of thought and the strength of 
love. 
You are right, this is a time of rapid change in the world 
and there is so much sorrow, pain and strife. Yet people 
feel helpless to do anything but at the same time they want 
to something. For  many decades there has been a network 
of workers who synchronize their prayers for world peace 
and harmony. All are welcomed to join this great 
community and here is the practice. 
The practice is usually done at nine PM your local time, but 
if you are busy at that time you can do  it when you are free. 
Every day at that time for about ten minutes the 
participants calm down their  emotions and thoughts and 
send out a very powerful  elemental for: Peace on Earth 
and Love for all Human Beings. 
173 

Since this is done at nine PM local time, this prayer sweeps 
across the globe through all time zones one after the other, 
blanketing the entire Earth with this powerful prayer for 
peace. Human beings need this very much. Because 
anyone can see that the world is on fire now and there is 
violence and bloodshed everywhere. There is an Arch­
demon who is behind this, successfully contaminating the 
minds and hearts of human beings against each other. No 
need to mention this Arch-demon's name. 
So we take ten minutes a day to send out thoughts of love 
towards all with a powerful prayer that real peace rules in 
this plane of existence. We can make that prayer stronger 
by visualizing rosy luminous light blanketing the planet as 
we pray. 
Q.  Since elementals never die, as our physical bodies do, 
can our Self Aware Soul (to the degree of its ability) enter a 
created elemental and continue on indefinitely? 

A. This question is about a teaching in a previous Virtual 
Circle Lesson concerning Elementals and an Elementary. 
You may recall an Elemental of our self is what we are 
calling an Elementary.  Firstly, all Self Aware Souls have the 
same abiliry to create these but precious few haYe a real 
need to do this. So any Self Aware Soul could create and 
enter into an elementary  and express in any of the three 
worlds of existence - the material, psychical or noetical. 
They  could continue this way for as long as needed, but it 
would never last indefinitely because in these three worlds 
everything is changing all the time and nothing last 
indefinitely. So  the need to do this would be temporary 
and not indefinite. 
Q. Do others on the physical plane actually see, feel and 
hear this elementary as if they  were in ordinary human 
form? 
175 

A. Yes to a person observing this elementary it would seem 
exactly like a regular human body. They could see it with 
their eyes, speak with it and shake hands with it.   They 
could receive tangible help from that elementary. 

Meditation 
Relax  completely. Feel you are in the material body, from 
the toes to the head. See that you are fully relaxed in your 
material body. In your material body that you feel you are 
in (your body is not your Self), the hean is beating. It 
started beating at the time of your birth and it will continue 
beating until the silver cord joining your other bodies with 
your  material body is broken. So, the silver cord at one end 
is your material heart, and  that silver cord is making your 
heart beat. 
Try to feel the pulse ofLlfe in your body. You are li,-ing in 
your material body. But who are you living in that material 
body? Your personality is, yet your body is haying in it the 
pulse of Llfe - which is you. 
The personality is not you. The personality is the sum-total 
of your elementals. The egoism is the expression of these 
elementals, good or  bad.  But, all that's not  you. At the core 
of  your personality is the pulse of Life, and  the pulse  of 
Life is the  Selfhood. You are that Ray  of Selfhood, which is 
177 

at the core of the personality. You have to study who you 
are 
as a human being now, living in this material body. 
By studying that you'll be able to concentrate your attention 
and observation on the other bodies. And, you'll develop 
what we call the self-consciousness. 
Who do you think you are as a man or as a woman? You 
are 
breathing and you started breathing the moment you 
were born, and you will be breathing until your last breath. 
Then, you will leave the material hnr!y. 
You are breathing subconsciously, but now, you can 
control your breath. You can breathe consciously, and later, 
you can learn to breathe self-consciously. 
Now, you are breathing the vital energy all around you in 
the air that you are breathing. But, that's not all. Now, start 
breathing deeply, consciously, feel the air filling your lungs. 
Feel, you are filling the lungs with this vital energy. Now 
you are working on the etheric double of your material 
body. Fill your body with this energy. You have to value 
this material body of yours and value the work done 
by the 
178 

Holy Archangels, the Lords of the Elements (your brethren 
in spirit), using the Total Wisdom and the Divine Plan. A 
great work every moment is accomplished in your material 
body. Even the nails on your hands and toes are growing; 
every hair is growing with regulated precision. 
Feel that you are completely relaxed in 
y
our material body 
and  ask the Lords of the Elements and the Lord of the 
Selfhood,  Christ, to give perfect health to your material 
body. He is willing to do so, if you do not interfere with the 
work of the Holy Archangels by living in a disturbed wa
y
.

Chapter 6 
Cleaning Our Sub Consciousness 
One of a Researcher of Truth's most important 
practices is daily Introspection. Introspection cleanses our 
subconscious of harmful elementals. The subconscious 
mind has three chambers. One of the chambers is like a 
warehouse, which stores all of our elementals. And this is 
the chamber where we will work during our introspection 
exercises. 
Everything has a unique vibration. Thoughts, 
feelings, desires, motivations and intentions create 
vibrations. The sum of a person's vibrations produces a 
totally unique tone. This tone is different for each and 
every personality. We could think of this tone as a 
personality's psycho-noetical address. This tone identifies a 
person's unique state of consciousness. It is a unique 
frequency like a radio station. 
180 

Let's also consider that each personality is like one 
string of an uncountable number of strings on a musical 
instrument. When that string is struck it starts to vibrate 
and emits a tone.  No two strings are tuned exactly the 
same because no two personality are exactly the same. 
Even in the  case of identical twins. 
Now, let's say you have a musical tuning fork 
nearby, which is attuned to the identical frequency of one 
of the strings on the musical instrument. When you sound 
that tuning  fork, what will happen? The corresponding 
string on the musical instrument will sran to co-vibrate at 
the same frequency of the tuning fork. This is a physical 
example of the principle of Attunement. 
This is also simplified example of the principle use 
to  find someone or  something in the  psycho-noetical 
worlds. Say an advanced mystic wants to find someone in 
any of the psycho-noetical worlds of existence. If he 
"sounds" the exact tone of that person it is if that person's 
string statts to co-vibrate and stand out from all the other 
181 

strings and is thus located by the mystic. No matter how 
many people there are; only one of them will vibrate in 
harmony with the specific vibration sounded by the mystic. 
This is how out of billions and billions of people residing in 
different planes and sub planes in the psycho-noetical 
worlds; a mystic can track and find a single individual. This 
is attunement. The mystic is tuning in to the person or 
thing he is looking for. 
Something similar occurs when we enter deeply into 
Introspection. Each day the thoughts, feelings, desires and 
events of our life slip below the surface of our conscious 
mind and rapidly amass in our subconscious mind. So 
during introspection we review the day's events. In doing 
so we can find something we could have done better. So in 
introspection we know to examine, in a detached way, the 
events of the day. We are not to make excuses of our 
behavior, and not to condemn ourselves for less than 
desirable behaviors. 
182 

We seek to enter the state of consciousness of a 
keenly aware but emotionally detached observer. We want 
to be a pure witness to our thoughts, desires, words and 
actions of the day. In doing so, we find places where we 
could have done better. We learn not to say and do things 
we should not. We also learn what action or words would 
have been better. We resolve to do better in the future and 
improve the quality of our character as a personality. 
It does not stop there. We first introspect on this 
day, which will eventually lead us to introspect on 
experiences that occurred previously this year, then in years 
before and throughout our entire lifetime. This is where 
developing the skill of attunement can really help us.  As 
we said a master can  find a single individual in the vast 
psycho-noetical worlds by attunement to their specific 
vibration. So too in Introspection we can attune and find a 
single experience long forgotten, but permanently recorded 
in  our subconscious mind. 
183 

By way of example let's says a seeker has reacted to 
some unsettling circumstance with strong anger and ended 
up punching someone in the nose. Now during 
introspection this seeker may be shocked because this is 
was a very untypical behavior for them. In fact initially 
they do not ever remember reacting in so much anger that 
they punched someone in the nose. So in their nightly 
Introspection they use this unfortunate opportunity to 
deeply research what made them act in this unacceptable 
way. 
So they introspect on the feelings and thoughts 
going on in them immediately before they got angry and 
threw the punch. What they will discover is this anger had 
a very specific vibration. Now, concentrating deeper on 
that vibration is similar to the mystic sounding the tone to 
find a person in the psycho-noetical worlds. Similarly 
concentrating on the angry vibration and its expression can 
cause a resonance in previously  forgotten but permanently 
recorded memory of a similar experience. Let's say after 
184 

deep introspection the person awakens a memory of when 
they were in high school, got very angry and hit someone. 
Continuing  along these lines the seeker may go further 
back in time and recall an incident earlier in childhood 
where he or she got very angry at another child and struck 
out physically. Tracing the causal connections between 
these few but directly related events can trigger an insight 
of gargantuan proportion,  freeing the seeker from ever 
reacting in this way again. 
We first learn to introspect on this day, this year this 
lifetime and one day even beyond this lifetime. Practicing 
introspection over time you will find yourself not just doing 
introspection at the end of the day but also during the day 
after 
a noteworthy 
event. 
Then 
as you take this 
practice 
further, 
you will 
notice 
that automatically 
you 
start doing 
introsp
ection 
in 
real time as events 
unfold. 
This skill 
of 
intro
spection 
can and will be transfer
red 
to your 
e
xper
iences 
in 
the 
psycho-noetical 
worlds-
either 
in sleep 
or after the death of the material body. 
185 

Now we have been speaking of attunement. 
Attunement means changing - adjusting our vibrations to 
the frequency of any other existence or being. Attunement 
is reached prior to experience of At-One-ment. The At­
One-Ment is the Super Self-conscious state in which a 
being is able to merge itself in complete uni
t
y with any 
other Being, existence, or with Absolute Beingness in 
Theosis.  Theosis means tull unification with God. 
Furthermore, At-One-Mentis achieved without ever 
abandoning our Self-conscious I-ness. 
Attunement is a great, great power that the average 
person has not really understood or harnessed to their 
advantage. One characteristic of our Soul Self (not the 
personality) is what we call the Super Light. This 
superlight gives the satisfaction of attunement and At-One­
Ment with anything the Soul-Self wishes. Through the 
transcendence of the egoism of the present-day 
person
ali
t
y 
we can enter into various degrees of attunement with our 
Self Aware Soul. 
186 

Now in the process of introspection we are 
encouraged to bravely dive in to the untamed ocean of our 
sub-consciousness. An ocean is a good metaphor for the 
conscious and subconscious mind. The surface of the 
ocean represents our conscious mind - what we can see 
and are aware of, however the surface of an ocean is only a 
small fraction of the ocean itself. Everything below the 
surface of the ocean is like our sub-consciousness. In this 
metaphor the sea creatures in the ocean are like the 
elementals in our sub-consciousness. When you go to an 
ocean and stand at the edge of the water you may see some 
tiny fish swim by.  But to really discover what creatures lurk 
in the  depths of the ocean you have to get in the ocean 
yourself and dive deep. And  that is how it is with our sub­
consciousness during introspection. 
To a point, the deeper you dive in an ocean the 
larger creatures you see.  So too in Introspection we must 
dive  deep  into our own sub-consciousness to find the 
larger group elementals that have the greatest effect on us 
187 

but as yet are not that easy to see. Diving to the deepest 
parts of the physical Ocean we find very strange and sea 
creatures that look like they are from another world. 
Likewise 
at the depths of our own subconscious mind we 
find very strange and surprising elementals living unseen 
and unsuspected by us. 
Daskalos taught: "The way for us to get to know 
our sub-consciousness is through introspection. There is 
no need to know the details about the sub-consciousness. 
Introspection is the study of our present personality. 
Introspection helps us to improve ourselves by uprooting 
imperfections and by developing virtues. 
After a lot of introspection and psycho-noetic 
exercises the Researcher of Truth penetrates deep into the 
subconscious mind. Now he will be able to utilize those 
recorded events of the present personality. Is it important 
to dig up every troubling experience we had in this life? 
No, because whatever you are experiencing today is an out­
picturing of what has taken place before. Looking at the 
188 

past in detail is not necessary, because the sensible 
researcher follows God's advice of "He who has put his 
hand to the plough looks ahead and not behind him." If 
you look at the crooked row you made behind you (this 
means past mistakes) and do not keep your eye on what 
you are doing now the row you are now making with the 
plough will  be crooked too. 
We have to study all this when we meditate and 
make our nightly introspection. It is a great and scientific 
work. We should not continue create noetical images 
(elementals) that rise from our sub-consciousness to reach 
the surface of our consciousness, without kno'w�ng their 
relation to the concept of time and space. Otherwise we 
would not  be able to  extend good working elementals, to 
know them and to govern them. They  would  escape  from 
our perception. So we do  introspection to know our real 
self. The  age  old adage of "Know thy Self''  means that we 
have to analyze and recognize our reactions to our desires, 
189 

thoughts coming from the sub-consciousness, this helps 
lead us to the knowledge of our true Self. 
Although it may sound like light years from where 
we are now, with further training very advanced mystics 
have shown they can materialize these images. In 
materialization the transportation of these noetical images 
plays the main role. This is kinesis - a   function of the 
Kinetic Ether of our etheric double. It is a matter of 
certain frequencies of vibration of the elementals, which are 
coming from the noetical world, the world of thoughts, 
into the three dimensional world, the world of matter. This 
is materialization. So in broad strokes, we have just given 
the mechanism of materialization used by the masters. The 
opposite happens for dematerialization. 
Now, you can see yourself by introspection - from 
within. You have studied your reflections as a present day 
personality and can now touch on the reality of who you 
really are. You have learned to use Mind consciously and 
reasonably. You have learned how to dis-energize bad 
190 

elem
entals 
and 
to 
create 
angelic 
eleme
ntals
. In 
our 
in
trosp
ection, 
in meditation, 
we ask 
ourselves 
"Wh
o am 
I? 
Wha
t am 
!?" If we do this 
with 
sincerity, 
our 
Guard
ian 
Arch
angel 
will 
one 
day 
reveal 
our Real 
Self 
to us. 
In 
introspection, we will see that our shadow 
self, 
the 
present day personality is subject to a particular 
place 
and time while  having its own consciousness and sub­
consciousness. Just like there is a Cosmic Consciousness 
there is also Cosmic Sub-consciousness. The egoism of our 
present personality likes to deceive and often tries to 
impersonate the  Inner Self. This has been observed in 
both  regular  psychology and parapsychology. Wben you 
begin your introspection, care must be taken to arnid being 
deceived by this false voice and falling into its snare. We 
must be sure from the beginning that which is the 
Permanent Personality (the Inner Self) and that which is 
the present day  personality. It is only  the present day 
personality who is under examination by the permanent 
personality during the process of introspection. The 
191 

permanent personality is in no need of being examined for 
mistakes. 
A real and present danger of introspection is that the 
egoism of the present personality likes to impersonate the 
role of the inner Self.  And its pretence can seriously 
mislead you.  So we have to be very careful not to mistake 
the statements and advice offered by our own egoism as it 
tries to mimic the loving guidance of our true Self or our 
Guardian Angel. 
Through introspection we see that the self-aware 
Soul or permanent personality does not struggle against the 
present personality or rebuke it and neither does our 
Guardian Angel.  The inner Self will get   to know, advise 
and correct the present personality and assimilate with it. 
So if during introspection, you feel a rebuke or the weight 
of guilt -do not accept it.  Neither your Inner Self nor 
Archangelic Guides ever do this. 
When you find in yourself a steady fixed point that 
impersonally receives the impressions - then you have 
192 

found your True Self. The position of the present day 
p
ersonality is never steady but always changing. Perhaps at 
first you won't recognize it, but through introspection and 
experience you can start to distinguish your real Inner Self 
from the temporary personalit
y
.  You will be  ,·ery happy 
when you will recognize that. 
Your real Self is not your name, your bodily form or 
your feelings, thoughts, aims, desires, happiness, or 
sadness. That is  not  your Self. All that  may be what you 
think you are  at this moment, but  definitely that  is not you. 
You are that steady  central point of awareness  recei,ing all 
the impressions in your life. Everything else rernlYes 
around that center.  However, if the center is remO\·ed 
eYerything around it will dissolve. Everything that rernlves 
around this center, happiness, sadness, aims of the self­
aware personality are all shadows cast in time and place. 
All of these are simply reflected externally, and assimilated 
into the center. You will discO\·er all this through research, 
int
rospection and by meditatio
n. 
193 

When you recognize this real Self of yours, you 
realize you are not who you thought you were for all these 
years. You are not the weak creature who was sometimes 
suffering and saying, "I hurt. I am in pain." The real you is 
not in pain. It is the temporary personality that feels this 
pain. When you reach this point, you can calm down the 
phenomenon of pain that is created by the impressions and 
reactions of your personality. You will become more 
powerful. You become the master of your house, but you 
can't be the master as long as you mistakenly think that you 
are only the physical body or the present day personality. 
This personality, which we mistake as our self, is 
vibrating according to what we have built up within us, 
within our subconscious mind. This means our thought 
and emotion based elementals. The human being as the 
present self-aware personality is not the master at this 
moment. This little self-awareness is something that is 
constantly influenced by the environment. Sometimes the 
slightest provocation annoys and irritates the personality 
194 

and creates within it a sickly condition of egoism and 
unfortunately this we mistake as our Self. This is just the 
state of our personality at this moment. It is only a 
snapshot taken in time and space and thus will be subject 
to continual change. 
However, I can also find that steady central point 
within  this personality and say,  "No, I am much more than 
that changing uncertain self. I am the one that can 
observe and check the behaviour of my personality." In 
checking our personality's behaviour what do we find? We 
will see that, the manner of my thoughts, feelings and 
behaviour at  this moment is the  product of  the  past. 
Therefore, as this constantly changing personality, I am a 
totality of past influences. 
So now we begin the serious search within our 
subconscious mind. This is serious work but it is not 
difficult to  do.  You don't need great effort or  hard work. 
Decisiveness and determination is all you need and in 
195 

peacefulness and calmness you can begin your self-
examination. 
Soon you will start to wonder: Who am I that is 
doing the introspection? Who am I that is doing the self­
searching. Who is that in me that can with a little 
provocation become annoyed, swear, get angry and wants 
to take the law in its own hands? 
Now a decision comes: No, I    will not react in this 
way again.  In the future I will not let this happen. I will be 
the master of situations; I will smile or turn away from 
provocation. This is one way of researching and studying 
our behaviour and how we are being affected. I can study 
it and instead of getting angry and annoyed, I will try and 
see if the others right or wrong. Now who am I when 
someone characterizes me in a particularly unfavourable 
light?  Am I that characterization? 
The first thing we should do in that situation is to 
research the question: Is this person right or wrong? Why 
does this person believe they are right?  Naturally we want 
196 

re
ach 
the 
correct 
conclusion 
about this. 
But be 
careful! 
We 
need to study 
this thoroughly. 
From 
the 
first 
mom
ent 
of 
this 
research 
the present 
self-aware 
person
ality with 
all 
its 
cunningness begins to make excuses. 
When you 
hear 
exc
uses or exonerations 
for its behaviour, 
realize 
that 
is not 
coming from your 
T
rue Self. 
When you hear these excuses you have a precious 
window of opportunity to catch your egoism. From the 
moment that the present personality comes forward 
wearing the mask of egoism full of hurt feelings and 
excuses, you take that self firmly by the hand, so that it 
can't get away. Say, "come here, you are not me.  Now I 
can control and examine you and see who you really are." 
"You are annoyed. \1''hy are you annoyed? \'
{
bo is 
the you that gets annoyed?" Or ask, "\1'bat is that in me 
that gets annoyed?" Pay close attention at this point in the 
process as you  ask these questions. Tr
y 
to discover who 
you think you are at this very moment? 
197 

Ok, what about annoyance in others people. What is 
it that makes someone so irritable that you can't even talk 
to him
/
her?  It is because he
/ 
she is enslaved by egoistic 
elementals. These elementals are the cause of the 
irritability. Getting upset towards someone who is always 
causing trouble is not the answer. The answer is first to 
become aware of the disease, (because it is a psycho­
noetical disease) and see if you can help them - if possible. 
In reality most victims of such elementals in our society do 
not get help.  A characteristic of these people who are 
enslaved by such elementals is that when you are near them 
you immediately want to get away from them. How many 
times have you notice an aversion to certain types of 
people? Maybe this even happens with a person that you 
used to like being with, now you no longer find pleasure in 
their company. Now it seems, their presence makes you 
feel very tired, you want them to get away from you.  You 
can notice this even in your family berween your relatives.

at the

t.  If

at least 
do no harm 
to them 
by over 
reacting and getting upset with them. 
When you start introspection it is  not necessary to 
exhaust yourself by going very deep in  order to find 
yourself, because your  real  Self is the same Self, who is 
really doing the examination in introspection. The self 
who is not you is the one under this examination. \11:'hen 
we 
begin the examination to correct the present persona
li
ty 
self, our aim will not be to kill it but to transform it, to 
change it. Take note of this point. We will find that as  we 
gradually cut out the bad habits - those things our true Self 
does  not  need, out true Self will start expressing it's Self in 
time and space much better, becoming much brighter. 
Therefore you have nothing to lose and eYerything to gain. 
199 

These are key points you must have in mind when doing 
introspection in order to research and find your True Self. 
Today's lesson is very important and needs to be 
thoroughly studied. We are giving the correct way to 
approach introspection. Introspection is not an exercise 
that should be carried out in exactly the same way by 
everyone. This is because your way of living, your 
circumstances and environment are all different. Of course 
the problems in life are the same but the specifics of your 
life are not exactly the same as others. What problems are 
the same? Everyone's egoism gets offended or wounded. 
This is common for all.  Then what should be our aim in 
Introspection? Our aim should be to free yourself from 
the delusion that your suffering present day personality is 
your True Self. And it is very important to take action in 
changing our undesirable behaviour. In our inner world we 
need to introspect like a person of action, come to un­
conflicted decisions and get real results. In the outer world 
200 

we 
sh
ould 
act like an introspect 
perso
n -
think
ing 
things 
through very well before acting. 
So we begin to separate the present self-aware 
personality from the permanent self-aware personality. If 
we don't  achieve this shift in awareness we will not really 
progress very far. Because we will only be  working from 
the vantage point of the limited present day personality and 
not with the  real  will power of the inner Self. We ha,·e said 
you don't have to sacrifice much. Just practice 
introspection a just before you fall asleep. With 
introspection we only need ten to fifteen minutes. The 
reason we do introspection at the very end of the day is 
because that is when our subconscious is more porous and 
accessible. This nightly introspection will continue on even 
after your body falls asleep. Then you will carry on doing 
your introspection exercises as you start improve your 
behaviour in the psychical world. This introspection work 
is not only while we are still living on Earth but also it is 
201 

the practice of a research of truth in the worlds beyond 
Earth. 
In our next lesson we will broaden our 
understanding about the power of elementals and how they 
can form into larger collectives called group elementals. 
We will examine two types of group elementals; the ones 
associated with our families and our nation. 

Questions 
Q.  W
hat is the 
difference between 
forgiveness and m
erc
y? 
A:  Forgiveness is a part of the healing process - forgiving 
the others and forgiving our self. John the Baptist 
baptized people for the forgiveness of their sins.  Christ 
prior to a healing so often said: Your sins have been 
forgiven you. This was very important because it relieved 
the guilt of the so-called  sinner. The removal of guilt is an 
important step in any healing. This is what a confessor in 
church is  doing or should be  doing. This is also the role of 
a psychiatrist. To free the suffering person so that a 
cleansing of the sub-consciousness can take place, this is a 
necessary part of a healing. Of course we are not Christ 
and cannot forgive the sins of others to His degree. But we 
certainly can and should forgive the unintentional wrongs 
as well as the intentional wrongs others have done to us. 
203 

\\ihy should we, what is the benefit? The first benefit is to 
us.  For if we continue to hold on to the offenses others 
have done, we are poisoning our self and the so-called 
wounds we feel from these offenses do not heal and tend 
to fester. The sorrowful hurts we feel and hold literally 
change the chemistry of our physical body - not to 
mention the harmful effects on our emotional and mental 
bodies. Scientist proved this by studying the chemistry of 
tears. When they looked at the chemical composition of a 
tear of joy and compared it to the chemistry of a tear of 
sorrow. They found that tears of sadness and sorrow are 
full of toxins not found in tears shed in joy. 
So the very first benefit of forgiving goes to us.  Holding 
on to wrongs and hurts others have done to us, locks us in 
a negative karmic exchange with that person. It does not 
matter that this exchange is not done ourwardly in words or 
actions, because the negative thoughts and feelings we 
indulge create negative elementals that are exchanged 
204 

in
stan
tly even 
if the other 
person 
is thousa
nds of 
miles 
away 
from 
us. 
The second benefit of true forgiveness is to release our self 
and the other person from this polarized situation of right 
and wrong which is always circular in nature. It is circular 
in nature and continued over time; it spirals downward in a 
destructive exchange of harmful elementals.  Also Christ 
statement on forgiveness reveals something else, he said: If 
you forgive other people when they wrong against you, 
your heavenly Father will also forgive your wrongs. This is 
a Law  and a promise from God.

We can remember we had pain but we cannot bring the 
actual pain back to us as an experience. Think of a time 
when you were badly hurt or recovering from an operation. 
Close your eyes and try to bring back the experience of that 
pain. You cannot do it - you can remember you did have 
pain but you will not be able relive it as real pain in the 
present moment. 
God will allow memories of all kinds of experiences to be 
imprinted in you, except pain. Isn't this proof of the 
Mercy of God? In our opening prayer of our lesson 
tonight we address Absolute Beingness as "God of Life, 
Love and Mercy." 
One of the best and most effective prayers we can make, 
which the disciples and followers of Christ were making 
2000 years ago was: "God have Mercy upon us 
accordin
g 
to your lovin
g 
kindness." But like all prayers, 
you have to say it with your heart and not just with your 
lips for it to be really effective. 
206 

Something 
else; 
people 
are sometimes 
creating 
monstrous 
thought 
forms, 
the elementals, 
with 
their 
expressions 
of 
suspicion, 
anger,  jealousy 
and hatred. 
Every 
elemental 
has 
a form 
of its own. 
But do we see them? 
No but we 
sometimes 
can sense 
them 
and they 
can really 
make 
us 
shake. 
It is the mercy 
of God 
that 
He is not allowing 
us to 
see the demon  type  elements 
born 
from 
the darkly 
negative 
human 
feelings 
and thoughts 
that 
people 
express. 
If we 
could 
we would 
be terrified 
or at least 
feel very 
ashamed. 
But 
it is not only 
God 
that 
can show 
mercy, 
we can show 
mercy 
to our fellow human 
beings. 
And 
that is what 
Christ 
was 
advising 
us to do when 
he said: 
''It 
is mercy 
I 
want; 
not sacrifice." 
Q. When 
a person 
is incarnated 
into a 
life where 
they find 
themselves 
very  much 
attracted 
to the kind 
of work 
of the 
Researchers 
of Truth, 
does  this  mean  that  they 
are "ahead 
207 

of the game? In other words, if I am Jiving this life with a 
strong focus on developing myself towards Theosis, could I 
be born in my next incarnation without this interest? 
A. Anything we truly learn in a lifetime is transferred to the 
Permanent Personality the inner Self and is not lost. By 
"truly learn" I don't mean just theoretical knowledge I 
mean that which we fully learn by direct experience. 
Knowledge we accept from outside ourselves, from a 
convicting source, can be lost. It can be easily replace by a 
more convince source that says something different. 
But wisdom that is gained by direct experience cannot be 
taken away from us now or in the future. When we know 
and understand the truth coming from our direct 
experience; we feel that we own it; it is a part of us. We 
feel that in some mysterious way we always knew it but just 
now discover it.  We feel that way because that is the truth 
the understanding is stored permanently at the Soul level. 
208 

In 
th
e 
next 
incar
nation 
that 
wisdom 
is 
cert
a
inly 
is 
a
v
ail
a
ble 
to 
the 
new 
incarnate
d personality 
but it is 
not

personalit
y depending 
on 
wh
a
t 
need
s 
to 
be 
d
evel
oped 
in that 
incarnation. 
But 
it is 
poss
ible 
for 
the 
per
sonality 
that  can  attune 
to  the  Inner 
Self 
to be 
a
ble to 
brin
g these 
understandings 
back 
throug
h into 
the new 
incarnatio
n -   as long 
as it is not 
blocked 
for some 
important developmental reason. 
But even in this case it is only temporarily blocked. It 
always  remains  stored in the Permanent  Personality. This 
kind of learning and assimilation is ours and builds in a 
cumulative way-nothing truly gained is ever lost. 
Now this question also raises and interesting point in 
asking if those who engage in the teachings of the 
Researchers of Truth are "ahead of the game". Yes but 
not only in the next incarnation but also when they pass 
209 

over to the psychical planes. Those who learn the 
teachings and engage in the practices of meditation, 
concentration, observation and especially visualization can 
find themselves in a privileged condition on the psychical 
planes. Firstly they have learned something about the 
territory of the psychical planes and its laws. They are 
ahead of those who know nothing about the conditions of 
their new  home and have to be taught. 
Secondly and most importantly they have consciously 
developed the means of movement and the techniques of 
manifestation that  are needed on the psychical planes. Is 
this privileged condition something like being born in a 
very rich family on earth? No! It is so much better than 
being born to rich parents, because we will not need others 
to provide for us.  We ourselves will already know how to 
create that which we want  and need. So yes,  the sincere 
researcher of rruth is "ahead of the game - very ahead of 
the game". 
210 

211 

Meditation 
Our divine nature is to recall impressions from the past 
experiences should be studied. When you practice 
introspection you'll also have to study this phenomenon of 
visualization. This way you are studying the divine nature of 
your Present-Day Personality. 
With your eyes closed, in what light do you see things in 
visualization? After practicing for some time; you will see 
things in the noetical light (brighter than the light 
emanating from the sun). By practicing you will see the 
luminosity of memory and you'll study the nature even of 
your Present-Day Personality and its divine state. But, you 
have to remove all the veils of darkness from your 
personality (that you have placed there by wrapping 
yourself in negative thoughts and emotions). Who is doing 
it? It is your personal egoism. You have to annihilate your 
personal egoism in order to let the sun of the Ego rise, in 
order to understand who you are in reality. 
212 

Though 
we have a material 
body now, very similar in 
composition 
(not in form) from the bodies of the animals; 
we are not that body. 
We are simply using it 
(and the other 
bodies). 
We are a   Self-conscious 
E
go
-Spirit. Apart from 
being a phenomenon 
of life we are Llfe itself. But you'll 
have to find that by introspection, 
contemplation, 
meditation, 
and the right way of concentration 
and 
observation. 
Your bodies 
(though 
they are not you) are "isely built and 
wisely sustained. 
Don't waste the Holy lvlind-vitality. 
Ask 
your brothers 
in your bodies, 
the Holy Archangels, 
to heal 
your personality. 
They are ready to listen to you, but - you 
have to make changes 
in your personality. 

Chapter 7 
National and Family Elementals 
National Elementals 
All human beings are now slaves of the elementals 
of their own creation. They suffer because of that. Christ 
called them evil spirits, unclean spirits and spirits mute and 
meaningless (which means those do not have logic in 
them). They are a spirit, which has a living existence, but 
they are not Spirit, which is Life itself. We could categorize 
them as sub-spirits. 
Once an elemental is created it is extended into the 
outer environment and begins its living existence, which 
will continue until it fulfills its purpose or until it is de­
energized. An elemental can be de-energized ether by the 
one who created/ revitalized it; or by an advanced master 
who knows how, or by Archangels. Every day we 
unknowingly give our Archangelic brothers unnecessary 
work to do in de-energizing the undesirable elementals we 
214 

c
re
ate. 
An 
old 
English adage says, "Chick
ens 
com
e 
hom
e 
to 
roo
st." 
This is true of all our elem
entals as 
well. 
Chri
st 
sai
d in 
his 
parable about the   elementals 
that 
once 
they 
are 
s
ent 
out of us, 
the eventually return back 
home 
to the 
one 
who 
sent 
them. 
What is   the force that makes 
them 
return 
back 
to the one who sent them?  It is the attrac
tion, 
which 
come
s from 
the person who originally created them. 
This 
vibration
, emanated from the personality, gives life and 
power to the elemental. However, the radiation continues 
to vibrate and   to resonate in the ethers long after the 
elemental has been created and sent forth. This is what 
eventually draws the elemental back to its origin. This 
process 
creates an electromagnetic 
resonance in the 
ether 
betw
een the 
elemental to the one who 
projected it. 
This 
v
ibrati
on of thought 
and emotion keeps the 
creator 
of the 
ele
mental 
responsible 
for it and its effect is 
either 
good 
or 
b
ad. 
This 
process also creates what we 
call Ka
rma -
G
ood 
K
arm
a or 
Bad 
Karma -depending on the 
nature 
of 
the 
e
lem
entals we send forth. 
215 
' 
..

I• 

So we have this vibration; this radiation coming 
from the person who created this elemental and it keeps 
them connected with the elemental. Also after the 
elemental is extended it is radiating its own vibration. So 
there is a second vibration, which is coming from the 
elemental itself. It is one elemental but two radiations, one 
from the elemental and one from the person emanating the 
elemental. This creates an interaction between the 
elemental and the sub-consciousness of its creator. 
We have also spoken about Group elementals, which 
are just the amalgamation of individual elementals of the 
same kind.  When Christ asked the demon-possessed man 
in Gadara Who are you?  The group elemental answered, 
"M
y 
name is Legion, for we are man
y
." This means a 
group of elementals composed of a massive amount of 
individual elementals that have joined as one assembly. 
The individual elementals that form into these group 
elementals have something in common between them: A 
similar vibration that allows them to mass together,

of a National

tal 
cre
ated by the  Greek 
Christians 
that affected 
the 
Turkish 
Muslims 
who are occupying 
Cyprus. 
Prior to 
1974   Cyprus 
was 
a republic with both 
Greek 
and Turkish citizens 
-
Cypriot Christians 
and C
yp
riot Muslims. 
Just like 
in Beirut, 
Lebanon 
a short stretch 
of sea miles off the coast of 
Cyprus. 
As you may remember 
in the late '80s 
a civil war 
erupted 
between 
the Muslims 
and the Christians 
and 
between 
one Muslim 
faction 
and other Muslim 
factions 
all 
living 
in Beirut

The nationalistic 
and 
religious 
fighti
ng between 
the 
factions 
destroyed 
what 
once was 
a 
bea
utiful 
tourist location. 
The city was 
de,·astated 
and 
m
any 
were 
killed. 
I 
believe 
Daskalos 
had 8 
circles 
with 
ov
er 2
00 me
mbers 
there when the 
fighting 
st
arted. 
All but 
217 

a couple of these students were killed before the fighting 
stopped. 
A similar event was brewing in Cyprus. In 1974
, 
Turkey invaded Cyprus and killed or drove the Greeks 
from the northern side of the island to the south, forcing 
them to abandon their homes and property forever. The 
UN peacekeeping forces managed to stop the invading 
Turks by creating a neutral zone running through the 
middle of the capital city of Nicosia. To this day the 
neutral zone of the city is divided and protected by UN 
troops. 
Later, the Greek Cypriots decided to hold "National 
Day" parades on their side of Nicosia. The Turkish 
people on the other side of the city were peaceful at first. 
But then the Greeks started going around in the parade 
sounding trumpets, waving the Greek Flag and making a 
lot of commotion about their Greek Cypriot patriotism and 
national pride. Daskalos was there and pointed out to an 
acquaintance that when the trumpets blew there was a

The man said, "What is it we are doing?" 
Daskalos replied succinctly: "] will tell vou in three 
Three days later the Turkish side announced 
thev 
would 
also start holding 
National 
Day Parades.  Before the 
occupation 
neither the Greek Cypriots nor the 
Turkish 
Cypriots 
ever cared 
to celebrate 
National 
Day. 
Bue now 
because 
the Greek 
side started celebrating

Turks

219 

Daskalos saw the man again and said, "See what you 
have done." Daskalos explained that not only the 
elementals of patriotism (which he thought was a crime) 
but also the idea of holding a celebration for National Day 
was created in the Turks by the actions of the Greeks. 
Now the Turks are imitating what the Greeks did and 
celebrate their version National Day. Daskalos' friend 
objected sa)�ng, "But the Turkish did not see us wave the 
flag in the parade on the Greek side of the city." Daskalos 
replied, "No need to see anything. They are just are 
repeating these things subconsciously." 
Daskalos advised, ''.Just put aside the national 
egoism, which is a devil and see that you are giving love, 
which are the gifts of your soul, and not the curses of your 
personality." 
When you see an angry protest against war, for 
example, the vibration of anger and hostility generated by 
the peace demonstrators actually sets off angry war-loving 
vibrations in them and in the people they protest against.

So individuals and groups feel and respond to the 
invisible vjbrations of these elementals.  The point being 
that when people rev up the vibration of national 
patriotism, they are creating powerful elementals.  These 
elementals strengthen the same feelings in our enemr and 
the polarity of them versus us escalates. It doesn't matter if 
our so-called enemy is on the other side of the citr or on 
the other side of the planet. Distance is no obstacle to the 
transfer of elementals.

sender and the receiver. As Researchers of Truth we have 
highly effective practices to break this destructive cycle and 
protect ourselves from these things. 
Daskalos and his students, especially the advanced 
students, worked hard to prevent the situation in Cyprus 
from boiling over and melting down like it did in 
neighboring Lebanon. To do this work they had to create 
loving reconciliatory elementals to bring down the tension 
and neutralize the hostile national elementals generated by 
both the Greeks and Turkish Cypriots. One day, it was 
planned for leaders of the Muslim religion from the 
occupied side of Cyprus to meet monks and nuns from the 
Christian side of Cyprus.  This meeting was to take place in 
the UN-protected neutral zone that divided the city of 
Nicosia. Before this event Daskalos and his students began 
creating specific elementals of brotherly love and 
reconciliation. They visualized that Muslims and the 
Christians would embrace each other as brothers. 
222 

H
o
weve
r, the 
media 
expected a 
violen
t clash 
(as 
happ
ened 
b
efor
e when 
the 
two 
sides 
met 
in the 
neu
tral 
zone). 
I'd 
entere
d this 
neutral 
zone 
before 
and 
learne
d of 
these 
previo
us events 
where 
Christian 
monks 
and 
nuns 
ca
me 
to 
the 
neutral 
zone 
to demonstrate 
against 
the 
divisio
n of their 
homeland. 
Wben 
this 
had 
pre,·io
usly 
happen
ed, 
the 
Turkish 
army 
violated 
the neutral 
zone 
by 
rushing 
in and 
capturing 
the 
Monks 
and 
Nuns 
who 
were 
imprisoned and tortured on the Turkish side of Cyprus. A 
UN  peacekeeper informed me there were too mam· 
Turkish soldiers for them to stop this from happening. 
But now on this day, the media gathered expecting 
to  see further violence when the Christians and :\!uslims 
entered the neutral zone. Instead, the Christians and 
Muslims met peacefully and respected each other and it 
ended with Turkish Muslims and Greek Christians 
embracing each other as brothers, just as ,�sualized by 
Daskalos and his students. The media was surprised by 
this  and  could  not understand why there was no violence. 
223 

Here we see the power of conscious thought-desire 
elementals created by Daskalos and his students. We see 
how these more powerful thought-desire type elementals 
overcame the larger group of desire-thought based 
National elementals created sub consciously by the Greeks 
and the Turks. 
Family Elementals 
Again, these National Elementals are group 
elementals, as our Family elementals are.  While we have 
our own personal group elementals to deal with, as stated 
before, we are also influenced by the elementals of our 
immediate and extended family. 
Family Elementals form in groups, which are hosted 
by and affecting many generations in the family. It says in 
the Bible that the sins of the father are passed down to the 
third and fourth generation. These are the negative, 
unwholesome Family elementals, which are passed down 
through specific family members who vibrate in harmony 
224 

w
ith 
them. 
They are 
passed 
from 
one 
gener
ation 
to the 
n
ex
t and 
often accepted 
as the norm 
without 
any 
effort 
b
ein
g mad
e to stop th
em. 
However, 
if 
membe
rs in 
the 
fam
ily 
refuse 
to allow 
the unhealthy 
Famil
r elemen
tals to 
be 
expr
essed 
in 
them
, then 
it is possible 
to stop 
this ,·iral­
like transmission to future generations. 
I knew of a family who had a vicious group 
elemental of anger that affected virtually eyeryone in the 
extended family to some degree. It manifested a bit 
differently in the various family members but ther were 
under the  influence of this highly toxic  family elemental of 
anger. Unfortunately they thought, as so mam do, if 
someone angered them, they were quite justified in taking 
revenge on that person and did so with impunit:
v
.  One 
day, a policeman stopped one of the males in this family 
for a simple traffic violation. The man became so angry 
that he started a physical fight with the policeman. In this 
case the man was so strengthened by his anger that he was 
wining the  fight  and  ended up biting off part of the 
225 

policeman's ear. How angry would you have to be that you 
would try to bite a policeman's ear off? We should all 
contemplate what an uncontrolled angry person is capable 
of. 
Not all evil elementals that cause havoc in a family 
originate with the family. In  1989, a lovely woman from 
Switzerland came to see Daskalos. She had a long scar 
down the side of her beautiful face and when she smiled is 
was a sad smile. There was a somberness about her that 
revealed something serious was going on. She had been in 
a bad  car accident and almost died. This  left  her scarred 
and afraid. In addition, other people in her immediately 
family had recently died in various accidents. She had 
come to Daskalos to find out what was happening to her 
family. 
Daskalos researched it and found that her father had 
cheated someone in business. That fellow went out and 
hired a black magician to curse her father and the entire 
family. Soon the father died unexpectedly, then her sister, 
226 

th
en 
oth
er 
close 
family 
members 
and then 
she 
nearly 
died. 
So 
here we 
see how 
destructive 
elemen
tals 
can 
be 
in
trodu
ced into a 
family 
and spread 
destru
ction 
to 
other 
fa
mily 
memb
ers. 
Fortunate
ly  Daskalos 
was 
able to break 
this 
curse 
caused 
by these 
demonic 
elemen
tals that 
had 
infected 
her family. 
What 
we call our Family 
is really 
a temporary 
family, 
which 
is associated 
with 
this particular 
incarnation. 
Of 
course at the highest level all human beings are brothers 
and sisters in the family of mankind. Our temporary 
family has to do with the bloodline from our ancestors, 
which 
are passed 
down 
to our descendants. 
Blood 
is a 
carrier 
of the etheric 
and consequently 
the elemen
tals. 
So 
the 
blood 
in 
a family 
is a means 
of transmissio
n 
of Family 
ele
mentals. 
Family 
elemenrals 
are like etheric 
genes 
that 
tra
nsfer 
the 
mental 
and emotional 
heritage 
of a 
family to 
its 
me
mbers
. What 
did Christ 
say about 
famili
es? 
He said, 
"Do 
you think 
I came 
to brin
g pea
ce 
on 
e
art
h? No, I 
tell 
you,  but 
division
. From 
now 
on th
ere 
will 
227 

be fh·e in one family divided against each other, three 
against two and two against three. They will be divided, 
father against son and son against father, mother against 
daughter and daughter against mother. A man's enemies 
will be the members of his own household." 
Of course Christ was not saying it is all right to fight 
with family members or  that this would happen in  all 
families. But he was advising us that sometimes our biggest 
life lessons could be with  our  own family members - so be 
prepared. 
Christ also gave us the remedy when he said, '1ove 
your enemies and pray for  those who persecute you, 
that you may be children of your Father in heaven." 
Following His instructions we should never criticize 
an
y
one, never accuse an
y
one and never sus
p
ect an
y
one 
because all that creates elementals that injure them. Instead 
try  being kinder to  that person because even if  you are 
correct in  your suspicion and that person had an  eYil 
intention, you create an elemental that actually  pushes them

Daskalos 
knew a  Cypriot man who 
brought 
a 
woman from Greece to  marry. 
HoweYer, 
there were 
rumors she was not of good morals. There was much local 
gossip about her. The man's aunt was the ringleader of the 
gossip. One day  she  said she  suspected that this  Greek 
woman would go  to  the  husband's first  cousin  for sex. 
Daskalos told her  that all  her  suspicions and accusations 
were pushing the  wife in  that direction. The aum would 
not  listen to  Daskalos and kept going on  and on about it 
and  how  bad  the woman was. 
Eventu
ally  the  husband 
did  find  his 
wife "ith 
hi
s 
first 
cousin
.  The 
aunt 
continued 
the 
edl

go
t 
t
he 
entire 
family 
into 
an  uproar, 
crea

The 
poor 
husband 
was

s 
229 

incident and the  family gossip pushed him over the edge. 
One day the adulterous cousin was playing cards in a local 
coffee house and the husband· found out.  Someone told 
Daskalos that the husband had a dagger and intended to go 
and kill his cousin for  sleeping with his wife. Daskalos 
said if the cousin dies from this, the aunt would be the real 
killer. 
Daskalos went  to  the  coffee house and  found the 
disloyal cousin gambling. Then the husband arrived pushed 
open  the  door  and  entered the  coffee house with  his 
dagger. The husband was so enraged he did not even notice 
Daskalos. 
The  husband reached for  his  dagger but  it 
would not  come out  of  its  sheaf. He  then  turned to 
Daskalos and  said,  ''Why are  you holding my  hand?" 
Daskalos was not holding his hand physically and yet the 
man  felt Daskalos' holding his  hand  and keeping him  from 
drawing the dagger to kill his cousin. 
What actually happened? Daskalos created a stron
g 
thought type elemental not to draw the dagger. Thought is 
230 

p
ow
er -
energ
y
. 
Every 
thought 
creates 
an 
elemen
tal. 
So 
th
e 
hus
band 
receiv
ed Daskalos' 
strong 
thought, 
"Don't 
do 
it," 
and 
felt his own 
hand energetically 
held 
from 
draw
ing 
the  dagger and killing. 
The final outcome was that the unfaithful wife went 
back to her family in Greece and the husband came to see 
Daskalos. He said, "Thank you, Daskale, I would ha,·e been 
hanged, or  be  in  prison all  my  life  had  you not stopped 
me." 
So we  see  here the power of elementals when they 
take over people. When the elemental becomes the master 
of  the  personality and  not  its  servant a  Yer
r 
dangerous 
condition 
is created. 
Look 
at all the conflict 
that is 
going 
on 
all around 
the world 
today. 
\'(1hat

about

are strengthening war-loving elementals. 
The next lesson will be an important lesson for 
231 

anyone wanting to approach God. We will speak about 
how the negative elementals that gather in our heart center 
obscure the connection to the light of our  Inner Self and 
God. We will also explain how to use  light meditations to 
cleanse our heart center and open  our connection to the 
Inner Self and God. 

Questions 
Q: 
Are 
there 
more 
ways 
other 
than 
dailv 
introspection 
for 
dis-energizing 
elementals. 
I ask  because there 
are many 
emerging 
approaches, 
accessible 
to anyone 
wishing 
to 
remove 
Light 
obscuring 
elementals, 
yet the Researchers 
of 
Truth 
might 
have 
new 
angles 
to this art. 
A.  This 
first 
step 
towards 
de-energizing 
undesirable 
elementals 
is to come 
to a clear 
and un-conflicted 
decision 
to eliminate 
them. 
This 
step 
can be the hardest 
and take 
the most 
time 
to truly  accomplish. 
Then 
before 
we can 
de-energize 
harmful 
elementals 
we first have 
to be able to 
detect 
them  and  learn 
the way they 
operate 
and how 
they 
affect 
us. 
This 
is exactly 
what 
you find 
during 
your 
nightly 
Introspection 
practice 
and 
by practicing 
Obset
T
ation 
throughout 
the day. 
Do not be in a hurry 
to remove 
anything 
at first. 
Take 
your 
time, 
study 
the situation 
in 
order 
to come 
to a clear 
understanding 
of what is 
reall
y 
233 

takin!! 
place 
in  rnu. 
Don't 
UY to work 
blindly. 
:\lost 
pcopk 
make 
the mistake 
to act before 
they 
fully 
realize 
the 
intricate 
workings 
and 
far reaching 
effects 
of their 
elementals 
and 
this 
leads 
to failure. 
Once 
you 
haw 
a solid 
grip 
on what 
is happening 
then 
you 
can 
make 
an effecti,·e 
plan. 
So introspection 
is more 
of a 
means 
for discorering 
what 
elementals are 
at work 
in mu. 
Then 
in Introspection 
we can 
also 
start 
visualizing 
how 
to 
free 
ourseh-es 
of the unwanted 
thoughts, 
desires, 
words 
and 
actions 
that 
are causing 
real 
problems 
in our 
life. 
The 
primary 
means 
of eliminating 
unwanted 
elementals 
is 
to dc-cncr.L,,jze 
them. 
This 
means 
that 
we must 
rtmo,·e 
our 
attention 
from 
them 
in  order 
to depri,·e 
them 
of the  ener�,y 
of our 
attention 
that 
is empowering 
them. 
Do 
not 
think 
on

do nm 
fed 
them, 
do not 
express 
them 
and 
do not

to act in undesirable 
wars. 
This 
is the 
simplest 
and 
fastest 
war 
to rid onescli 
of unwanted

men

Once 
we

our anention on something more posim·e and inreresring. 
]'.;ever de-energize an elemental without immediately 
replacing it with something more positl\'"e and life. 
affirming. Otherwise it is easy for that un11i1111ted 
elemental to rerurn to fill that empty place. 
There is another way to rcmO\"C elemcnws, but it is the 
harder way. Elementals can be eliminated by the creation of 
another opposite elemental. But here is the problem with 
t
hat method. The opposite or replacement elemental needs 
to be filled with about two times the amount of cne,gy the 
lln"l>'antcd elemental has been gn=-
235 

For example, say you have someone who smoked a pack of 
cigarettes every day for 30 years. Each time  that person 
wanted a cigarette it gave a bit more strength to their 
elemental of smoking. So at least 20 times a day, 365 days 
a year, for 30 years that person subconsciously 
strengthened the elemental to smoke - that adds up to 
something like 219,000 times that smoking elemental was 
re-vitalized. Now it is very strong indeed. 
Then after 30 years of smoking the person decides to quit. 
So to eliminate this smoking elemental by creating an 
opposite stronger elemental would be a tremendous 
amount of work and take some time. So this is the harder 
way, but it does work. 
But when you develop the skill to de-energize elementals 
the easier way, you will not want to waste time on creating 
opposite elementals to do the work. De-energizing

Q. You commented on the harm in being 'suspicious' of 
someone. Could you please expand on the definition of 
suspicious? 
A. By suspicious I mean the act of distrusting or believing 
something negative of someone else. Being observant to 
the actual words and actions of others is  not suspicion 
because you are observing what is actually happening. 
However upon observing their behaviors, if you then 
ascribe dark motives and evil intentions to those actions 
that is suspicion. 
I was saying that suspicion creates an elemental and that 
elemental takes a  form and the form is  the idea shape of 
237 

what you are suspecting that person of. By the act of 
suspicion we send that elemental automatically to the 
person we are suspecting and it creates an influence on that 
person to do exactly what we are suspecting them of. 
It is just like prayer. Praying for someone creates an 
elemental that goes to that person and influences them 
according to the idea of help you have in mind. So in 
suspecting someone of something negative or evil we are 
acrually creating a  force that pushes him or her in the 
direction of doing what we suspect. So we do not want to 
become  black magicians by beings suspicious. 
238 

Meditation 
Breathe deeply and feel in your whole material body. We 
do not 
w
ant kinetic ether. Don't feel any movement in your 
body.  When you feel your material body, you are in the 
aesthetic ether of your material body without really noticing 
it. 
Feel that you are in your entire material body. You are only 
in the aesthetic ether of your material body. When you feel 
that you are in your self-aware-self, which self are you in? 
Are you in   the present-day-personality-self, or in the self of 
the permanent personality? Think about this. 
You 
are in your material 
body as self-aware
ness. 
You are a 
co
nsciou
sness. 
What is this consciousness 
you are in at 
this 
m
om
ent? 
Are you in the consciousness of 
your 
present­
day-
pers
onality 
or the Permanent

239 

Chapter 8 
Master of the Heart 
As we mentioned before we should try to enter 
deeply into the meaning of the prayers we make. In our 
beginning prayer, we make an invocation to God: "God of 
Life, Love and Mercy, enlighten our minds to understand 
your Truth." What truth are we asking to understand? It is 
the truth that all human beings are our brothers and sisters. 
Next we make the invocation: "Clean our hearts ... 
which means clean the hearts of all the human beings. 
"Clean our hearts, to reflect your love towards You and 
towards all other human beings." This means to reflect 
God's Love towards Him, the One God, and towards all 
other human beings - to really Love all human beings 
without exception. 
As seekers of truth we cannot have enemies. There 
may be others who consider us as their enemy but we must 
not consider others as our enemy. Can we have friends? 
Well as Daskalos advised, "Have neither enemies nor 
240 

fri
ends. 
Con
sider all as brothers 
and 
sisters bel 
, 
o
ngm
gto 
th
e sam
e fam
ily, the human 
family: 
brothers and 
sisters 
belon
ging to the same house, the planet 
earth." 
This is the real truth concerning 
the human race. 
All are part of the same family because 
we are all part of 
the common 
selfhood 
-The Logoic Selfhood. 
This truth 
is expressed 
in Christ's 
statement, 
''Whatever 
you have 
done to the least of these my brethren, 
you ha,•e done it 
unto me." 
Do you want to hear God? Daskalos 
asked a man 
that question 
once. Of course that fellow eagerly said, 
"Yes, 
I do." So Daskalos 
told him to lie down, close his eyes and 
put his hand 
on his chest, slightly 
above the heart. "Wbat 
do you hear?" Daskalos asked 
him. 
"I hear nothing." 
The man replied. 
"Are you sure? Don't you hear your heart beating?" 
Daskalos 
asked. 
'CV 
es, of 
course I 
do," he answered, 
"but, it's only 
the 
sound of my heart 
beating
." 
241 

Daskalos 
continued 
by asking 
him, "Who 
makes 
your heart beat? 
Who gives you the heart? 
You didn't 
think about it, but it is God doing that!" 
Daskalos 
told him the beats of his heart was God 
saying, 
"I love and you live. I love you and you live.  I love 
you and you live." 
Where 
do we want to find God? God is Life and 
Life is everywhere. 
God is the Life in you and around 
you. 
What other kind of God do you want to find other than the 
Author 
of Life itself? 
Christ 
said, "I am the Way and 
the 
Truth and the Life." 
Now I ask you, "Do you want to see God?" 
What 
did Christ 
say about seeing 
God? He said, "Blessed 
are the 
pure in heart for they shall see God." 
So he is referencing 
the heart. 
He is not meaning 
the material 
heart but the 
heart center 
- the psychical 
center 
- the center 
of our 
personality 
self-awareness. 
As a human 
being we have the ability 
and the 
privilege 
of using the Mind to express 
human 
intelligence. 
242 

We also express a partial self, which is but a shadow of our 
real Self.  This little personality self is mostly centred on its 
name, its bodily form, and its limited way of understanding 
and conceiving things. Yet even as a temporary personality 
it has The Life in it. So, its nature is God, but its 
expressions are human. 
It is through that gate, which is the heart of our 
personality that we can enter and find our real Self, to find 
that we are an Eternal Spirit-Soul. But the   gateway of the 
heart we are speaking about is not the Material Heart 
Once, an uneducated Cypriot woman came to see 
Daskalos and said, "Oh, Sir I feel a pain in my heart." 
Daskalos said, "Show me where you feel the pain." 
She held up her hand. 
He said, "Your heart is not there." 
She said, "Yes it is  there, it is beating, my doctor told 
me so." 
So the doctor must have told her he want to check 
her heart and took her pulse in her wrist.  In reality, she 
243 

knew nothing about the heart as a physical organ and yet it 
was working quite nicely. This means that the 
material 
heart does not need the personality to do anything to make 
it 
beat. Nor does it even require the personality to be 
aware that there is such an organ as the heart. 
Yet without any effort on our part, the heart and the 
other organs are in good order, giving our bodies perfect 
health - unless we interfere. If by the way we are behaving 
it interferes with the work of the Archangels and the Holy 
Spirit, then it is we ourselves who are depriving our organs 
of the energy needed to function properly. This will 
ultimately bring consequences in this life or a future 
incarnation. 
Every moment, in each one of us, our heart is 
beating and the blood is circulating throughout the body. 
But who is making all that happen? Are you doing that as a 
Present-Day Personality? If it was up to us to rememb
er to 
make 
our 
heart beat, 
we all would 
be dead 
already. 
So, 
w
ho 
is 
making 
the 
heart  beat? 
Who 
is making 
the circula
tion 
of 
244 

th
e blo
od 
and 
how 
is the blood 
create
d? 
If you 
medi
tate 
a
nd 
try to 
unde
rstand 
these 
thing
s by 
study
ing the 
human 
body
, you 
will  start 
to understand 
some
thing 
of the 
Total 
Wisdo
m of the 
Infinite 
Bein
gn
ess and the 
Archang
elic 
workers. 
Most 
of the people 
are ignorant 
of what 
takes place 
in their 
bodies. 
So how 
can they 
know 
about 
their 
etheric 
double 
or about 
their 
psychical body 
though 
they use them 
without 
realizing 
it? Most 
people 
if they 
are provoked 
a 
little 
they 
get  angry 
or excited, 
they shout 
and maybe 
get 
red in the face 
if you 
ask them, 
''What 
are you actually 
doing? 
Why 
are you 
acting 
like that?" 
They 
don't 
know 
that 
subconsciously  they 
are using, 
or rather 
misusing 
their 
psychical 
body. 
Now 
unlike, 
the physical 
bean, 
the heart 
of 
the 
psy
chical 
body 
does 
require work 
on the 
pan 
of th
e 
per
son
ality 
to function 
properly
.  This 
means 
we 
have 
c
on
tr
ol ov

kinds 
of feelings 
and 
desires 
we harbo
ur

rts. 
We

that we

body ready -  made for us, but it  is we who have to work to 
construct a proper psychical and noetical  body. 
We do this work by following the Archetype held by 
the Guarding Angel. It is he who presents it to us as a 
perfect model. And just like a sculptor who uses a real 
human body to follow as a model when making a statue, 
we should try to emulate the model presented by our 
Guardian. He is presenting it by the way he is behaving to 
us, which the way of unconditional love. And of course 
the life of Christ demonstrated this archetype most 
perfectly. 
Now, when we do our exercises and meditations we 
should never concentrate in the material heart. This is 
hard on the organ and dangerous. The danger is we can 
disturb the work of the heart regarding the circulation of 
the blood. If people concentrate on the material heart, they 
get disturbances like excess heartbeats and irregular 
heartbeats. People who practice Yoga have noticed this. 
246 

We should not concentrate 
on the material heart, but 
we can concentrate 
in the chest, the entire space within the 
chest cavit
y 
including the lungs. We can safely concentrate 
on the etheric double of the entire material body all at 
once. But what do we mean by concentrating? 
We mean to 
feel it intensely but with   absolutely no tension. We want 
full artention but without any tension. If we concentrate 
on the material heart with tension, we interfere with the 
work of the Holy Spirit.  Tension creates an overflow of 
blood in the  organ and this   is not safe. 
Certain exercises we teach are safe because it is not 
dangerous 
to concentrate 
on the  entire heart center, in the 
whole chest area. To move around in it, using the kinetic 
and aesthetic ethers, 
and touch certain centers -but do 
not 
concentrate 
directly on these centers. By 
using the 
imprinting ether 
we can create certain colors and shapes. 
You can find some of these exercises in the Practices 
section of the Researchersoffruth.org 
web site. 
247 

At the beginning we use disks of light moving them 
around and passing them through certain centers. Later, we 
incorporate spheres of light, the holy spheres. The specifics 
of this training practice have been given many times. 
The centers of energy are to be approached wisely 
and with reverence. We should not violate them, by 
interfering in the creative work of the Holy Archangels in 
our body. This should be understood be for attempting any 
of the esoteric practices in our system. 
Now our first step is in purifying the heart. By 
purifying your heart, your whole body is purified. 
Controlling your emotions, controlling your desires, 
controlling your egoism, you clean the Heart Center. As we 
said in another lesson, unhealthy emotions and desires 
create dangerous toxins and poison our material body. 
The Hindus refer to the "Heart Chakra" as the 
center of energy on the etheric double that coincides with 
our material heart. This center of energy is of great 
importance to the Researcher of Truth. This center is 
248

is 
in the

heart 
that we 
h
ave 
the 
direct 
connection 
between 
the 
m

body 
and 
the psychical body. 
Don't we have this connection through the solar 
plexus? We do, but it is an unconscious connection 
through the center in the Solar Plexus. In the Heart Center 
the connection is conscious, and later it will be self­
conscious. If we do certain exercises and concentrate in the 
solar plexus, we could have subconscious vision, 
subconscious clairvoyance or subconscious clairaudience, 
but none of it conscious or Self-conscious. 
For Researchers of Truth, our aim is Self­
consciousness and it is through the Heart Center, we as a 
personality get control of all our emotions and desires. The 
center of our psychical body, of our emotions, is the heart 
center on the etheric double. 
This 
center 
is located 
slightly 
above 
the

flame of your love to flicker or make dark smoke. It should 
be a steady, strong and perfect light. 
Clean your heart to become the lamp of the Beloved 
One, Joshua the Christ. Or if you prefer call it the lamp of 
God, or the lamp of the Divine Selfhood, or call it the light 
of your own Self-Super-Consciousness. Different people 
give it different names. But it does not matter what you 
call this love-light. It is, exists, and expresses itself through 
a purified heart. 
Up to now your heart was His cradle, His manger. 
Now let it be His lamp so that one day your heart may rum 
into a bright sun through which the Divine light will shine. 
May your hearts become a spiritual sun, a sun of justice and 
total love, a sun through which the Divine light will 
enlighten you and shine its light on every human being 
around you. 
When you make your heart your church you can 
enter there and worship your God. Your heart is your 
church in reality. Now in the book of Revelations Saint 
254 

Jo
hn 
in 
his 
nativ
e Greek 
language 
referr
ed to 
the 
seven 
chak
ras 
in the 
etheric 
double 
of the 
material 
body 
as 
eglis
ia. 
This 
word 
is typically 
translate
d 
as 
"chur
ch". 
The 
w
ord is also 
translated 
as  a "meetinghou
se" or "gathe
ring 
place"  and 
this was 
Saint 
John's 
meaning. 
From 
the Esoteric 
standpoint, 
the gathering 
place 
gives 
us a muc
h 
better 
description 
of these 
centers. 
This is 
becaus
e the  chakras, 
the etheric 
centers 
associated 
with the 
material 
body, 
are  places 
where  our 
thought 
and emotion 
based 
elementals 
really 
do gather. 
Depending 
on the 
quality  and  quantity 
of these 
elementals they affect 
the 
functioning 
of the energy 
in these 
centers 
for better 
or 
worse 
and 
since 
these 
centers 
are assoc
iated 
with 
certain 
organs 
in the 
material 
body 
this also 
affects 
the health 
of 
those 
organs. 
Referring 
to  these 
same 
ethetic 
centers, 
but 
in 
the 
psychica
l body, 
Saint 
John 
called 
them 
lamps
, which 
g
ive li
ght. 
In 
the 
noetic
al body 
he called 
the 
seven centers 
of 
ener
gy, stars, 
which 
give 
even 
more 
light. 

So we must investi
ga
te what kind of congregation 
we are keeping in our churches and make them clean, and a 
suitable place for the Divine light to reside. We do this by 
observation and introspection of the thoughts, desires, 
words and actions of our personality. Then, we endeavour 
to eliminate the negative and empower the positive ones. 
We do not attend to the in between ones.  We must 
exercise care in working with these centres for, while it is 
necessary for us to develop and awakeu certain of them, 
others, like the root chakra, are in the domain of the Holy 
Spirit and Archangels. And we should not rry any 
manipulation or direct interference with these. 
Again the heart center is not simply the physical 
organ but the spiritual centre of our Being.  The heart 
center is our inner sanctum; the place of the mysterious 
union between our Divine Nature and our Human Nature. 
The material body itself, as an instrument, is purely 
holy-spiritual. But when the Soul-Self, the Permanent­
Personality-Self and present-day-personality-self enter in it, 
256 

the Logoic existence starts its expression. Then the Logos 
starts to rule in the heart center. The Logos is the true 
master of the Sacred Centre of the Heart. 

Questions 
Q.  We all say we have to  fight to the death our Egoism 
and present day personality! Why did God or the universe 
make this battle so difficult? Many people jeer at the fact 
that we have such a loving father because he asked his son 
to die a horrible death!!! 
A. Is it really God or the universe that makes the battle to 
overcome our egoism so difficult? Or is it that we 
ourselves have let the egoism of our personality go 
unchecked for so long? Because we are gifted with free 
will, we have created a kind of Frankenstein like monster 
called our egoism. In Greek mythology, egoism was 
symbolically depicted as the Minotaur. The Minotaur was a 
mad beast that had the head of bull and the body of a 
human and lived in a twisted underground maze called a 
labyrinth. Maybe this is where we get the term "Bull 
Headed" to describe a stubborn egoism. The 
258 

und
ergrou
nd 
labyrinth 
is a 
symbol 
for 
the 
sub­
con
sciou
sness 
where 
our 
egoism 
hides 
from 
us. 
And 
it is 
up 
to us 
as the 
hero 
of our 
own 
mytholo
gical 
story 
to 
brav
ely 
enter 
the 
subconscious 
layer 
of our 
egoism 
and 
slay 
it  just 
like 
the 
Greek 
hero 
Theseus 
did 
in the 
myth. 
Some egoism is more entrenched than others and this is 
what makes the battle so difficult. But we should never 
fight against or try to kill our present day personality, 
because at the core of our personalit
y 
is the Ray of our real 
Spirit-Soul self. So we are to kill the personalit
y
's egoism 
as  we clean and redeem the present-day personality until it 
is pure  enough to be transmuted into the Soul Self 
Awareness in the process called Self Realization. 
Certain

hor

nce.

was 
259 

\\-hipped and wounded so badly. Then they nailed his body 
to the cross and it died by hemorrhage. That was the 
purpose of the crucifixion - to die by the loss of blood. 
And at the very last moment, He looked down on his 
killers with love, saying, "Father, forgive them, they do not 
know what they are doing". Could anyone other than God 
make such a loving statement in such a horrific moment? 
He also taught that man was an eternal Spirit Being who 
continued to live after the death of the material body. And 
he proved it by allowing his body to be killed and then 
resurrecting it.  Other masters past and present have 
brought other people back to life whose bodies had died. 
But Joshua was the only one who resurrected his own dead 
body proving the truth of his teachings. 
Q. What would Daskalos say to someone in grief and 
would he try to heal them? What is the role of grief in our 
journey? 
260 

A. 
Of 
course I 
cannot 
speak for 
Daskalos 
But f 
· 
ro
m
my 
obs
ervations, 
I always 
saw Daskalos 
make 
e,·ery 
effort to 
try 
to heal 
someone 
who came to him 
for help. 
How
eY
er, 
we 
must be 
very gentle 
and careful 
should 
we 
try to 
help 
someo
ne in grief.  Grief is a process 
we 
under go as 
a 
p
ersonalit
y 
in releasing 
our attachment 
to someone 
or 
something that has passed from us. 
The Swiss-born psychiatrist, Elisabeth Kiibler-Ross, aptlr 
described the five stages of Grief, which are: denial, anger, 
bargaining, 
depression, 
and acceptance. 
Not that eYeryone 
goes 
through 
them in the same order or experiences 
each 
one 
exactly 
in the  same 
way.  But these are the 
stages 
experie
nced by 
most during 
the grieYing 
process 
especially 
over 
the loss 
of a loved one.  As a 
personality 
we come 
into 
each 
other's 
lives and pass from 
each othe
r's li,·es 
- no 
way to stop that. 
261 

However as our Inner Self - the Soul Individuality we are 
always connected. There is no sense of separation at this 
level, because we are all like different cells in the same body 
- the body of God. In our system we call this the 
common selfhood. Christ pointed this out when he said I 
am in you and you are in me and I am in the Father. So at 
the highest  level we are not separated even by the change 
we call death or any other physics 1  separation. 
But be very careful, it does not help someone to state this 
truth at the early stages of grieving in fact it may hurt them 
even more. Introducing this type of understanding is best 
left to the very last stage of acceptance .. .if at all. Christ 
knew this truth better than anyone, but when he saw 
everyone crying because Lazarus had passed over - he also 
wept with them as it says in the Bible. He felt the sorrow 
of the personalities around. To help someone in grief we 
should try to understand what stage in the grieving process 
262

Pra
y
er/Meditation 
This prayer was given by Joshua Emmanuel the Christ, in 
the synagogue of the Essene Brotherhood, to His disciples 
before sending them into the world to work as teachers and 
healers as is mentioned in the Bible. The word Essene 
came from the Aramaic word Asa, which means healer. So 
these were the 70 healers Christ trained until he was 30 
years old that are mentioned in the Bible. Up to this point 
in time he had only being teaching and healing in the 
Essene communities. It was when he was 30 years old that 
he chose the twelve companion disciples and began 
teaching to the Jewish communities and the general public. 
Relax completely. Visualize Joshua Emmanuel the Christ 
standing before you as you sit peacefully, listening. In 
perfect At-One-Ment with His own Divine Self, the Logos, 
and attuned with each and every human being, Joshua 
spreads out his arms and says:

"I am the Mind vitality everywhere in the world. I am Spirit

ARCHANGELS, ANGELS 
Holy Spiritual Beings assisting in the construction and 
maintenance of the worlds. They possess Total Wisdom 
and Absolute Self-awareness (though lacking the self­
conscious individuality specific to humans). We speak in 
praise of the Archangels of the elements, the Orders of 
Authorities, of Cherubim, of Dominions, of Overlords, of 
Principalities, of Seraphim and of the Thrones. In our work 
we speak of seven Orders of Archangels, each composed 
of billions and billions of Holy Monadic Beings serving 
Creation. Angels are Elementals of the Archangels. 
ARCHANGELIC MAN 
Archangelic Man is one of the Ideas (see 'Heavenly Man' 
and 'Causes, Ideas and Principles' below). The Holy 
Monadic emanarion passes through the Idea of Archangelic 
Man on its way to the Idea of Heavenly Man, thus the 
Archangels are the brothers of humanity. 

AT-ONE-MENT 
The su
per-conscious state in 
which a 
Be
ing 
is a
ble 
to 
m
erge 
itself 
in total 
oneness with any 
other 
Be
ing 
or e
xiste
nce, 
and 
with 
Absolute Beingness in Theosis
, without 
e,·er 
abandoning its Ego. 
ATTUNEMENT 
Attunement means adjusting our vibrations to the 
frequency of any other existence or Being to the extent that 
we can observe and study its nature. Atrunement is reached 
prior to at-one-mint. 
BEING and EXISTING 
Existing has a beginning and an end and is thus a timed or 
temporal phenomenon. Being is timeless and eremal, 
without beginning or end. 
269 

CAUSES, IDEAS and PRINCIPLES 
The Will-pleasure of Absolute Beingness is the primal 
Cause, as it is the cause of Creation. It is from within the 
Will-pleasure of Absolute Beingness, all the Causes spring. 
Causes then give rise to Ideas. Every Idea holds within it 
the whole Cycle of Possibility of the form to be created. 
Archangels work through the Ideas and impart Total 
Wisdom to each form. Principles govern the expression of 
Causes in time and space. 
CAUSAL STATE 
Above the Noetic State, the causal state is a condition of 
pure Ideas and Principles. It is also known as the fifth 
heaven. 
CAUSE AND EFFECT, LAW OF 
Scientists as well as mystics recognize the Law of Cause 
and Effect. This Divine Law requires every action to result 
270 

in 
a reac
tion. Y

The Law

Caus

operates 
over several 
lifetime
s as 
well as 
within much shorter periods. 
CHRIST, CHRIST LOGOS, LOGOS, LOGOI, 
LOGOIC 
The Greek word Logos can be translated as 'word' (as the 
Authorized Version does in the first chapter of St. John's 
gospel). Christ, as used here, alone or in conjunction with 
Logos, refers to the 'Only Begotten Son'. \\'hen Jesus, as 
the incarnation of tbe Christ Logos, is specifically meant, 
He is sometimes referred to as 'the Most Belm·ed Logos'. 
In our work, we often speak of the Holy Logos and the 
God-Man Jesus Christ, a full, direct, and pure incarnation 
of tbe Logoic expression of Absolute Beingness, 
271 

synonymously. Logoi is the plural of Logos, Logoic is the 
adjective. 
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, COSMIC MEMORY 
Here every event, past and present, in all the worlds is 
recorded. A mystic can perform research by attuning 
himself to the Cosmic Consciousness. Contained within the 
Cosmic Consciousness is the Cosmic Memory. This is the 
'heavenly archive' where the impressions, actions, thoughts, 
emotions and desires of all the Beings are recorded. 
CYCLE/CIRCLE OF POSSIBILITIES 
The Cycle of Possibility of each form is laid down in Total 
Wisdom in the Divine Laws and Causes. All forms are 
continually developing: from seed to tree, from child to 
adult. Each form changes so that experience may be 
gathered. In the Eternal Now a form is complete and based 
on a Principle, with its Cycle of Possibility already 
established. On entering the Worlds of Existence (material,

CYCLE/CIRCLE OF PROBABILITIES 
While the cycle of possibilities is the ideal development and 
is inescapable, the cycle of probabilities allows for the 
halting of a developing life at any point of its de,·elopment. 
A

DIVINE 
Used only for the Qualities, Causes, Ideas, Laws and 
Principles, and Beings, which emanate directly from 
Absolute Beingness. 
DIVINE GRACE 
It is a gift of  Divine Grace that we exist as humans, in our 
bodies, in  the uniYerses. 
DIVINE LAWS 
The Divine Laws are the basic structure of Creation, 
governing all worlds and universes, and corresponding to 
our higher nature. Epitomizing Reason and Love 
manifested, it is our recognition of, and ali
gn
ment with, 
these Laws (e.g., of Cause and Effect, of Harmony, of 
Order, of Growth of Love), which leads to our balanced 
and enhanced spiritual development.

most-wise Divine Plan of Absolute Beingness is the

ECSTASY 
Ecstasy is a going out from oneself into the Kingdom of 
Heavens through expansion, At-One-Ment and/or 
Attunement. Ecstasy implies a passing beyond all 
conceptual thinking of discursive reason. 
EGO and EGOISM 
Our use of these terms is not to be confused with 
contemporary psychological terminology. Egoism defiles 
Mind by the construction of selfish desires, and by the base 
emotions of greed, malice and envy. The Ego (with a 
capital E) is the Self as Beingness, the Soul nature, and is 
reflected through a reasoning and loving personality. While 
egoism (a weakness of our present personality) is the 
source of disease throughout the personality, the nation 
276 

and 
the 
world, 
our 
Ego 
nature 
brings 
forth 
love, 
compassion, 
reasoned

ETERNAL NOW, ETERNAL PRESENT 
Beyond the Worlds of Existence is the Eternal Now, the 
state of Everlasting Life. There, past, present and future 
collapse into a single present, without time or place. 
ETHER, ETHERIC VITALITY 
'Our daily bread', Etheric Vitality (l\iind) is obtained 
through breathing, meditation, eating and rest. We swim in 
a sea of Etheric Vitality which surrounds and permeates the 
globe, yet, through disharmonious lifestyles; most of us 
exhaust our portion of Etheric Vitality and are unable to 
restore it, leading to physical and psychic distress. All 
existence, including our bodies, is constructed within a 
mold of ether (the Etheric Double). We speak of four 
conditions of ether: creative, sensate, imprint and kinetic. 
278

from 
the gross 
material to 
the 
more 
refi
ned, 
displays these centers, 
which correspon
d to 
organs 
of the 
material 
body. We must exercise 
care in 
working 
with 
these centers, 
for while it is necessary 
for 
us to 
develop 
and awaken 
certain 
of them, others are the domain 
of the Holy Spirit, the Archangels and the Logos (e.g., the 
'root' and the heart centers) and we should refrain from any 
manipulation 
or direct interference. 
(For 'Heart Center' see 
below)

as the

(wh

material, Psychical or Noetical) is projected. When a body 
is withdrawn (passes over) its Etheric Double dissolves. 
The Etheric Double serves as the mold for the body's 
construction as well as in the preservation of the body's 
health. 
EXOSOMATOSIS 
Exosomatosis, is the literal Greek equivalent of the English 
expression 'out of body experience'. We all leave our bodies 
each night, during sleep, and travel to other planes 
subconsciously. 
The aim, however, is to live consciously while out of our 
bodies. We know of first, second and third Exosomatosis. 
GUARDIAN ARCHANGEL 
At the point of our first incarnation, upon passing through 
the Human Idea, the Self-aware Soul is protected and 
guided, throughout its long sojourn into the worlds of 
280

GROSS 
MATERIAL WORLD, 
BODY 
The material world is the lowest manifestation and 
vibration of Mind. Matter is :\lind made solid to compose 
the material world and material bodies. 
FAITH 
Not only an individual or theoretical belief in the dogmatic 
truths of a religion, but an all-embracing relationship, 
recognition of, and love for Absolute Beingness. As such it 
involves a complete transformation of a person's 
personality, whereby we are taken up into the whole the 
anthropic activity of God in Christ and of man in Christ 
through which we achieve Theosis. Faith, aboYe all, is an 
active virtue: 'Faith without works is dead .. .' Games 3:26). 
Also see 'Repentance' below.

INNER SELF 
Inner Self is a term indicating the Self in its expressions 
above the present-day personality. 
KARMA 
See under Cause & Effect, Law of 
LOOKING WITHIN 
This is the process of introspection or self-examination, of 
'knowing thyself'. This is the core practice of every 
Researcher of Truth and all those interested in Self 
Realization. 
MIND 
The Mind is a Divine emanation of Absolute Beingness to 
which all existences owe their construction. Imbued with 
the Divine Wisdom, Love, Power and Purity of its Creator, 
Mind is not an immortal Being, but is eternally used as the 
284

NOETIC STATE 
This is a state of Ideas and unexpressed fonns beyond the 
worlds of separation. This state is where we come to rest in 
between incarnations and where the Archangels derive the 
forms into which to breathe life. 
NOETICAL IMAGE 
A multi-dimensional image of Noetical or Psycho-Noecical 
substance, fanned by thought by means of Noetic light. 
Once formed it is everlasting, as are all Elementals. 
NOETICAL WORLD, BODY 
The five dimensional worlds and the most rarefied of the 
three worlds of separation. In the Noecical Worlds (home 
of the Noetical Body), the Total Wisdom of Absolute 
Beingness first finds expression as fonn, ranging from 
285 

uniYerses and galaxies to unicellular organisms. Time and 
place are attributes of the Noetical World, but not in the 
sense understood in the psychic and material worlds. 
OVER LORDSHIP 
In Yarying degrees, we find over lordship as in a sense of 
dominion and Divine Authority as ordained from above. 
PERMANENT ATOM 
That part of the Permanent Personality, which acts as the 
recorder of the experiences, it has received in the place­
time worlds. The Permanent Atom is situated in the etheric 
heart of each body simultaneously, and registers all the 
emotions, thoughts, reactions and experiences as they 
occur in the three worlds of existence. 
PERMANENT PERSONALITY 
The Permanent Personality is the acti,·e and expressh·e part 
of Soul in Self-awareness within the worlds of separation,

A personalin· deYeloped during each incarnation, whom we 
call 'George or :\lary' or ,,·hate,·er. The presem-da1· 
personality is a projection of the Permanent Personalitr 
into the worlds of separation. 
PSYCHIC/PSYCHICAL WORLD, BODY 
The psychical world is the four dimensional world, also 
known as the '\'i"orld of emotions'. The super-sensuous 
psychic World is composed of seYen planes. each ha,ing 
se,·en sub-planes. It is to the psychic \\"odd that we rra,·el 
in first Exosomatosis, in our Psychical Bodr, and to which, 
on passing owr, we first return. 
287 

PSYCHO-NOETICAL 
The relationship between the psychic World (emotions) 
and the Noetical World (thoughts) is often so intimate and 
interwoven that we need to consider them as semi-unified. 
In a thought there is often emotion, and in every emotion 
there is a measure of thought. 
REPENTANCE 
The Greek word for repentance is metanoia, which 
signifies primarily a change of 'mind' or 'change of 
intellect': not only sorrow, contrition or regret, but also 
more positively and fundamentally the conversion or 
turning of our whole life towards ali
gn
ment with Absolute 
Bein

The Personality

Dhine, 
Being. 
Selfhood 
encompasses 
all the expression 
of the Self from Its apex as 
the Holy Monadic Spirit-Ego-Being filtered 
down to the

289 



SELF-REALIZATION 
Self-Realization of the Permanent Personality as 
Individuated Beingness. This is the culmination of the 
gathering of experience in the worlds of separation. At the 
point of Self-Realization, the Permanent Personality 
reunified with Self-aware Soul is prepared to assimilate with 
the Spirit-Ego-Being in Theosis. 
SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
Self-Sufficiency is the primary Nature of Absolute 
Beingness, in complete Abundance, Blessedness and 
independence of all needs. 
SEPARATION, WORLDS OF EXISTENCE 
This phrase covers the three worlds of existence (material, 
psychic and Noetical) in which our personality spends 
periods of seeming separation from the Spirit states of At­
One-Ment and Beingness 
290

SPIRIT-EGO-BEING 
Our Self in its full divinity; it is eternal and urunonble. Our 
Spirit-Ego-Being is the Self as Holy l\fonad; in total At­
One-Ment with the Self-sufficiency and Multiplicit
y 
of the 
Godhead. The Will-pleasure of Absolute Beingness to 
express Itself within Itself is identical "�th the Will   of our 
Spirit-Ego-Being to express Itself in Its own Selfhood. 
291 

SUB CONSCIOUS, SUB CONSCIOUSNESS 
Researchers of the Truth understand the triadic nature of 
Sub Consciousness. One chamber of the subconscious 
contains all the Elementals composing our personality. A 
second chamber is the storehouse of Etheric Vitality 
(sometimes called our 'animal vitality') The third and most 
valued chamber is that of the Logos and Holy Spirit, for it 
is through the subconscious that the Holy  Spirit and the 
Logos impart Total Wisdom,  Total  Power and Total Love. 
SUPER-CONSCIOUSNESS 
Super-consciousness is total awareness in Beingness. 
SYSTEM FOR THE RESEARCH OF TRUTH 
Our system of Esoteric Christianity celebrates the eternal 
truths known to all great religious traditions, while firmly 
based in the teachings of the God-Man Jesus Christ and the 
New Testament. Through directed study, exercises and 
292 

medi
tations, we seek the balanced ev
olution 
d · 
an 
Int
egr
ano
n 
of 
our 
entire being. Our approach 
is metho
dical, safe 
and 
self-evident. 
TETRAKTYS 
(Pronounced tet-ruk-TEES) A group of four. The elements 
of Earth, air, fire and water compose a tetrakt
y
s. 
THEOS IS 
At-One-Ment with the One God, Absolute Beingness. 
TOTAL LOVE, WISDOM and POWER 
These are the Primary Natures of Absolute Beingness and 
Beings. Forming a sacred triangle each Nature is dependent 
on the other to be expressed properly. 
WILL-PLEASURE 
The Greek word 'euareskeia' has no   exact equh·alent in 
English. It carries a sense of pleasure deri,·ed from 
293
