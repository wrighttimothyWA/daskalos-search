So,	our	spirit,	soul,	ego,	is	life.	That's	why	we	are	gods.	And,	we	are	living	for	a	certain
period	of	time,	as	human	beings.
As	human	beings,	we	have	a	beginning	and	an	end.	We	have	to	go	around	the	circle	of
possibilities.	Now,	what	is	this	circle	of	possibilities?	A	few	moments,	a	few	hours,	a	few
days,	 a	 few	 years,	 many	 years,	 it	 depends	 upon	 the	 form,	 the	 living	 form,	 the
manifestation	of	life.
What	is	the	duration	of	the	circle	of	possibilities	of	a	macro,	of	an	ant,	of	a	fly,	of	any
animal,	of	a	tree,	of	a	little	plant?	So,	starting	naturally	around	us,	we	will	see	the	circle
of	possibilities.	Which	it	means,	you	cannot	go	from	your	circle	of	possibilities	to	another
circle	of	possibilities.	We	start	with	the	seed.
Many,	many	kinds	of	seeds.	Billions	of	seeds	having	the	same	size	and	the	same	color.
The	same	substance.
Matter.	Yet,	in	each	seed,	there	is	this	circle	of	possibilities.	The	seed	of	a	mustard	plant
and	the	seed	of	an	eucalyptus	tree	are	the	same.
When	you	see	that,	you	put	them	in	your	palm.	And	no	scientist	can	distinguish	which	is
the	seed	of	the	mustard	and	which	is	the	seed	of	the	eucalyptus.	For	the	total	wisdom	of
the	Almighty,	it	is	there	in	them.
Planting	them,	your	seed	will	give	you	an	eucalyptus	which	may	live	for	hundreds	of
years.	Maybe.	That's	the	circle	of	its	possibilities.
What	is	the	circle	of	possibilities	of	the	mustard	seed?	A	season.	A	few	months.	After
producing	again	seeds,	what	is	to	be	distinguished?	All	forms	of	life	are	favored	by	the
archangels	of	the	creation	and	their	archangels	supervising	it.
With	 the	 creativeness.	 That	 means	 creating	 seeds	 which	 will	 carry	 on	 the	 circles	 of
possibilities.	Now,	is	that	not	most	wise?	Can	we	not	just	see	now	that	super-intelligence
we	call	God	or	life?	We	should	just	understand	that	God	and	life	are	the	same	thing.
But	what's	eternal	life?	What's	the	phenomenon	of	life?	So,	these	things	can	be	studied
in	deep	meditation.	Meditation	now.	We	meditate	usually	on	the	circle	of	possibilities.
Which	means,	after	learning	the	concentration,	training	yourself	for	that,	then	you	start
the	circle	of	possibilities.	You	get	something,	anything.	A	plant.
Find	the	beginning.	A	seed.	A	cutting	to	be	rooted.
A	bulb.	How	does	it	start	its	life?	Now,	until	you	reach	that	point,	don't	go	behind	it.	Go
forward.

The	circle	of	possibilities.	What	should	you	do?	You	see	it.	See	it	in	your	bulb.
If	it	is	a	bulb,	or	a	sheet,	or	get	the	scissors	and	have	a	cutting	from	a	rose	bush	or	some
other	bush.	You	multiply	them	by	rooting	them.	And	see	how	it	is	done.
How	people	are	doing	it.	Plant	it,	sow	it,	see	it.	Which	means	meditation	means	also
visualization.
How	to	train	yourself	in	this	visualization	to	get	the	skill	of	it.	See.	Sit	with	the	closed
eyes,	comfortably.
After	relaxing	completely,	definitely.	No	tension.	And	peaceful.
Start	to	visualize.	And	then	sit.	And	sit.
Let	us	take	now	the	seat	of	quit.	Sit	in	your	palm.	Close	your	eyes.
Sit	in	your	palm.	Drop	it	down	on	the	ground.	Fertile	ground.
Now	see	a	landscape.	See	the	rain.	See	the	drops	of	the	rain	making	their	jump	and
covering	it.
Continue	singing.	Shooting	roots.	Two	quite	little	things	piercing	the	ground.
Going	down	and	then	again	over	it.	The	greenish	thing	to	come	on	the	surface.	See	it
growing.
Making	roots.	Growing	up.	And	see	it	as	you	can	see	it	in	the	field.
See	it	growing,	growing.	Not	just	jump.	Jumping.
See	it	growing.	Continuously.	Not	to	sit	just	like	that,	the	speaker	with	the	ears.
No.	Meditation	means	see	it	growing	naturally,	properly.	Then	see	the	ears	of	course.
See	the	whole	landscape.	There	are	billions	of	such	seeds	of	corn	now.	But	stick	on	that
one.
You	are	meditating	on.	Sitting	with	just	a	wave	in	the	field.	See	the	combined	now.
Working.	See	those	who	are	reaping	this,	if	you	like.	Conditions	changed.
See	what	you	can	see	and	what	you	like	to	see.	But	continuously.	See	heaps	of	that	kind
of	seed.
The	 grace	 of	 God.	 That	 one	 seed	 made	 it	 so	 many.	 And	 each	 of	 them	 will	 have	 a
beginning	on	what	I	call	circle	of	possibility.

It	cannot	escape	from	you.	In	all	centuries,	all	seeds	of	corn	have	been	seeds	of	corn.
They	didn't	become	the	seeds	of	something	else.
Now	this	is	a	study	on	what	I	call	the	total	wisdom	of	God.	And	you	just	realize	that
everything	 in	 the	 material	 plane.	 The	 vegetable	 kingdom,	 the	 animal	 kingdom,
everywhere	are	under	this	total	wisdom.
You	don't	like	to	call	him	God.	Call	him	super-intelligent.	Doesn't	matter.
Anything	you	do	will	not	be	able	to	comprehend	what	is	the	absolute	infinite	beingness.
Unless	you	bring	the	absolute	beingness	to	your	measure	of	understanding.	He	is	not
offended.
Don't	worry.	The	absolute	infinite	beingness	is	not	offended.	If	we	try	to	understand	it,
bringing	it	to	our	measures.
But	not	to	our	weaknesses,	for	God's	sake.	To	our	measures	of	reasonably	understanding
what	it	might	be.	Because	during	the	past	ages,	people	created	many,	many,	many,
many	gods.
When	I	say	to	their	measures,	giving	to	these	gods,	they	are	false.	They	are	vices.	They
are	weaknesses.
Now,	any	gods	they	have	created.	All	human	beings	from	the	earth.	It	is	the	infinite
beingness.
Everything	existed	and	exists	in	the	infinite	beingness.	It	is	created	by	what	we	call	the
mind.	Which	is	emanations	of	the	infinite	beingness.
So,	whether	you	go	to	South	Africa	or	to	any	place.	And	you	see	a	very	ugly	form	of	God
made	of	wood	or	of	anything	else.	And	they	kneel	and	pray.
They	pray	to	the	infinite	beingness.	Without	knowing	it.	You	call	them	idolaters.
No.	They	are	in	need	of	believing	that	they	have	a	protection	from	an	intelligence	higher
than	themselves.	That	was	the	need	of	the	human	beings.
Of	the	cavemen.	That	was	a	necessity.	So,	why	should	we	see	them	as	idolaters?	Since
everything	is	of	God	and	from	God.
Without	knowing	it.	And	now	Christians.	Even	Christians.
They	are	calling	themselves	not	idolaters.	Even	for	the	saints.	Of	the	Roman	Catholic
Church	and	the	Orthodox	Church.
The	Protestants.	Luther.	Took	away	from	the	Lutheran	Church.

The	saints.	Even	the	Virgin	Mary.	What	to	really	see?	Subconsciously.
Instinctively.	Not	consciously.	The	Mother	of	God.
Is	in	our	consciousness	the	Mother	of	God.	Before	the	birth	of	Mary.	Yes.
The	Virgin	Mary.	Because	she	remained	virgin.	She	reflected	the	real	Mother.
But	the	Mother	of	Nature.	Was	before	the	birth	of	the	Virgin	Mary.	Who	gave	birth	to
Christ.
And	for	me	it	is	the	infinite,	absolute	femininity.	Creativeness.	Which	it	was	always.
Is	 now	 and	 will	 always	 be.	 It	 is	 an	 aspect	 of	 the	 absolute,	 infinite	 beingness.	 The
pansympathic	femininity.
Which	was	reflected.	In	its	highest	degree.	In	the	Virgin	Mary.
But	the	Virgin	Mary.	Had	a	form	of	a	woman.	Perfect	though.
Yes.	But.	Phenomenon	of	life.
In	a	period	of	time.	And	in	a	space-place	which	was	Palestine.	She	passed	over.
As	we	believe.	Dematerialized	her	body.	Because	the	body	of	the	Virgin	Mary.
In	 substance	 should	 be	 different	 to	 the	 body	 of	 any	 other	 woman.	 Just	 so	 that	 the
absolute	infinite	beingness.	Has	perfect	laws	to	be	incarnated	as	Joshua	the	Christ.
Also	the	body	of	Joshua	the	Christ.	Just	like	the	body	of	anybody	else.	Walking	on	the
waters.
So	this	is	not	something	to	be	discussed.	Let	the	theologians	do	it.	But	Luther	had	done
the	greatest	mistake.
In	punishing	noble	elementals.	Which	were	the	saints.	Which	people	were	feeling	the
need.
Of	having	them.	So.	What	are	the	Christians	now?	Believing	for	the	saints.
What	were	the	saints?	The	saints	were	human	beings.	Who	succeeded	by	prayer	and	by
the	way	of	their	life.	To	raise	their	self-consciousness	to	the	highest	levels	of	self-super-
consciousness.
Therefore	can	be	conducted	now	even.	These	are	the	saints.	We	can	call	them	Christ.
Because	whatever	ever	existed.	Exists	in	the	cosmic	consciousness.	Either	active	or
dormant.

Everybody	can	investigate	that.	In	reaching	in	higher	levels	of	self-super-consciousness.
So.
We	said	everything	is	the	mind.	Good.	These	elementals	do	exist	now.
And	you	have	purified.	Good	archangelic	and	angelic	elementals.	You	have	also	evil
elementals.
Why	should	we	conduct	all	the	time	evil	elementals?	Kneeling	before	that	idol.	There	is
an	idol.	Our	request.
And	not	before	pure	and	good.	Evil	elementals.	Which	might	be	called	the	saints.
And	the	saints.	Most	of	them	are	unknown.	And	most.
Canonized	as	the	saints.	In	reality	they	are	not	the	saints.	Because	they	have	been
human	beings.
With	even	criminal	tendencies.	Because	we	are	not	going	to	discuss	that.	I	don't	believe
in	all	the	saints.
But	I	do	believe	in	the	saint	ship.	Of	Francis	of	Assisi.	Of	the	Dominican	founder.
And	many	many	others.	Which	now	these	intelligences.	Their	super-consciousness.
Are	around	us	and	ready	to	help	us.	But	they	don't	accept	a	name	now.	We	can	contact
any	of	these	super-intelligences	now.
Around	the	planet.	Whether	you	call	Saint	Nicholas.	Or	Saint	Savas.
Or	Saint	Dominic.	Or	Saint	Francis.	Or	Saint	Antonio.
Giving	any	name.	Now	in	their	super-consciousness.	They	are	all	one.
And	 they	 are	 ready	 to	 help.	 Because	 this	 you	 will	 find	 it.	 When	 you	 raise	 your
consciousness.
To	 their	 level.	 Because	 there	 are	 many	 many	 levels	 of	 consciousness.	 One
consciousness.
Raising	to	its	level.	And	you	can	do	that.	By	continuous	meditation.
Reaching	that	level	we	call	intuition.	Which	is	now	the	interference	of	your	guardian
angel.	Going	further	to	what	we	call	contemplation.
And	to	other	states	of	consciousness.	There	is	not	a	name	for	them.	You	have	just	to
reach	to	them.

Know	them.	Without	giving	names.	No	need	to	give	names.
Which	means	meditation.	Which	means	using	the	mind	now.	Which	is	our	property.
It's	our	right	to	use	it.	To	know.	To	know	what?	That	we	are	not	the	mind.
And	 we	 are	 not	 the	 bodies.	 And	 we	 are	 not	 the	 phenomenon	 of	 life.	 Though	 it's	 a
reflection	of	ourselves.
Now.	Reaching	a	state	that	now.	I	know	that.
I	am	I.	No	more	Mary.	Or	George.	Name?	Yes,	it's	enough	the	name.
I	am	I.	But	it's	common	to	me.	What's	wrong	in	that?	We	enter	in	our	nature.	We	enter	in
the	heavenly	man.
In	the	idea	of	man.	Through	which	we	have	been	humanized.	There	is	not	any	special
name.
On	the	divine	and	heavenly	man.	We	are	reflecting.	And	even	Christ,	Joshua.
Who	was	God.	The	locus	incarnated	directly.	Coming	through	the	idea	of	man.
He	calls	himself.	The	son	of	man.	Honoring.
The	idea	of	man.	Can	you	come	in	contact	with	the	idea	of	man?	Yes,	when	you	reach
the	self	super-consciousness.	And	you	have	in	you	are.
Not	personality	now.	But	individuality.	The	qualities	of	the	divine	man.
You	know	what	is	the	divine	man.	The	heavenly	man.	Because	we	belong	to	that	order	of
the	archangels.
Called.	Man.	And	man	is	a	class	and	an	order	of	archangels.
So.	Why	do	we	neglect.	This	origin	of	ours.
Our	source.	The	heavenly	man.	The	ideal	man.
Who	teaches	about	it.	Our	guardian	angel.	Who	took	that	form	and	that	shape.
In	us	and	with	us.	Sometimes.	Of	course.
In	 the	 innermost	 circles	 of	 our	 order.	 The	 brother	 guide	 is	 teaching	 the	 way.	 Of
conducting	and	coming	in	touch.
Even	with	the.	Divine	heavenly	man.	Which	means.
You	come	in	contact	with	Christ.	Because	we	cannot	reach	Christ.	In	its.

Logoic	nature.	It	is	too	high	for	us.	Unless	we	see	him.
As	a	human	being.	As	the	ideal	man.	Which	means.
Unless	we	create.	And	conceive.	Pure	elementals.
It	is	through	elementals.	We	shall	see	the	reality.	Behind	the	elementals.
So.	In	reality.	In	meditating.
That	means.	Getting	the	skill.	To	understand	the	nature	of	the	mind.
And	how	to	use	the	mind.	It	is	creating	elementals.	And	we	create	elementals.
Even	now.	In	an	instinctive	way.	Because	we	are	sentimental	life.
In	a	subconscious	way.	For	our	feelings.	Not	knowing	very	much.
About	things.	With	right	thinking.	Creating	now.
Creating	elementals.	Even	creating	elementals.	In	higher.
In	higher	levels.	But	all	the	time	it	is	elementals.	Which	means	forms.
Until	we	reach	that	level.	We	don't	need	anymore	the	forms.	But	we	enter.
In	the	origin	of	forms.	Which	are	the	ideas.	The	laws.
The	causes.	Now	I	think	we	are	in	very	deep	waters.	We	have	come	to	the	surface.
So.	Anybody	has	the	right.	And	this	is.
The	persuasion.	Of	the	Godman.	Joshua	the	Christ.
Be	ye	perfect.	As	perfect	is	your	Heavenly	Father.	That's	clear.
We	have	the	right.	He	is	persuading	us.	How?	We	ask	him	now.
How?	He	says	I	taught	you.	Know	the	truth.	And	the	truth	will	liberate	you.
From	all	illusions	in	life.	He	came	to	us.	Should	we	be	now.
Violent.	Asking	what	is	the	truth.	What	is	the	truth?	Why	Christ	did	not	reply	to.
The	 Roman	 Governor.	 What	 is	 the	 truth?	 Because	 even	 if	 he	 would.	 He	 would	 not
understand.
But	he	taught	us.	I	am	the	way.	And	the	truth.
And	life.	Which	means	the	truth	is	life.	That's	clear.

And	how	we	should.	Understand	all	that.	By	making	use	of.
Their	mind.	As	right	thinking.	Meditating.
Visualizing.	Observing.	Understanding.
Understanding	God.	I.	Who	understands.	I	am	not.
The	object	of	understanding.	Which	means.	I	am	a	different	person.
Now.	I	can.	Master	and	control.
My	material	body.	I	am	not	my	material	body	then.	But	I	live	in	it.
We	will	study	what	is.	Going	on	in	the	material	body.	Just	to	appreciate	and	value.
The	work	of	the	Holy	Archangels.	Creatively.	In	our	material	body.
A	great	honor.	To	engage	themselves	all	the	time.	Continuously	to	create	a	body.
And	keep	it	in	good	hands.	So	that	we.	We	live	in	it.
But	we	are	not	a	material	body.	It	is	theirs.	Let	us	call	it	ours	also.
Do	not	get	angry.	Study	our	emotional	body.	Psychical	body.
And	see	that	we	can	control.	Our	desires.	Control	our	emotions.
Control	the	element.	As	composing	our	personality.	And	our	subconsciousness.
Be	able	to	clear	up.	Completely.	And	clean.
That	dirty	pool.	Of	our	subconsciousness.	From	our	weaknesses.
Jealousies.	Enmities.	Hatred.
The	desire	of	attacking.	So	we	are	not	that.	Because	we	can	control	that.
And	then.	Now	I	am	using	the	mind.	And	I	can	use	the	mind	now.
Properly.	Instead	of	using	it	before.	In	serving	our	emotions.
In	serving	our	desires.	Now.	I	give	to	the	mind.
My	mind.	The	mastery	to	check	them.	Control	them.
And	through	the	mind.	I	come	to	certain	decisions.	I	am	not	in	the	mind	also.
Because	I	cannot	control	the	mind.	Ich	bin	nicht	das	Geist.	Many	are	making	the	mistake.

To	think	that	they	are	the	thought.	We	are	not	the	thought.	And	also.
The	mind	is	not.	The	Holy	Spirit.	You	Germans	make	a	great	mistake.
To	connect.	The	mind	with	the	Holy	Spirit.	Because	the	Holy	Spirit.
Is	the	manifested	one.	And	the	mind.	The	mind	is	the	means	of	manifestation.
So	you	have	to	make	this	distinction.	The	Holy	Spirit.	Is	the	infinite	beingness.
Itself.	You	shouldn't	separate	it.	So	what	emanates.
From	the	Holy	Spirit.	Emanates	from	the	absolute	infinite	beingness.	Which	is.
Everlasting	life.	Now.	First	of	all.
By	starting	the	meditation.	Not	at	the	beginning.	Because	it	is	a	difficult	subject.
To	know	what	is	life.	Even	as	a	manifestation.	What	is	life.
As	a	phenomenon	of	life.	But	this	is	still.	More	difficult.
Than	just	using	the	mind.	In	concentration.	And	in	meditation.
Of	what	you	call.	The	circle	of	possibilities.	Of	anything	you	choose.
To	meditate.	To	meditate	upon.	So.
Knowing	after	all.	What	is	the	mind.	How	you	use	the	mind.
What	is	the	reasoning.	You	understand.	The	value	of	the	phenomenon	of	life.
Your	life.	In	a	material	body.	Of	a	man	or	a	woman.
Is	not.	To	be	considered.	That	it	is	of	not	much	value.
It	is.	Because.	If	it	was	not	of	much	value.
Why	should.	The	holy	archangels.	Engage	themselves.
Continuously.	To	create.	For	you	the	spermatozoon.
And	work	in	a	body.	You	call	it	work.	Until	the	time.
They	decide	to	dissolve	it.	So	that	they	will	give	you	another	one.	So.
These	things	are	to	be	studied.	By	means	of.	Meditation.
That's	what	I	said	the	other	day.	We	must	occupy	our	minds.	With	the	right	meditation.

Because	there	are	certain	things.	Given	as	meditation.	From	this	text	book.
Leading	nowhere.	Now	we	have.	By	studying.
The	circles	of	possibilities.	And	probabilities.	I	can	say.
These	are	not	difficult	things	to	do.	But	they	are	possible.	And	we	need	to	do	it.
You	are	going.	Really	to	gain	the	right	knowledge.	On	nature.
And	what	is	going	on.	All	around	us.	And	also	study.
Our	own	personality.	Boldly.	Facing	it.
Acknowledging	the	force.	Which	means.	You	are	working	doubly.
As	the	present	personality.	And	as	the	ego.	But	the	reality	you	are	not	doubly.
You	are	one.	And	I	gave	an	example.	To	create	a	coin.
I	need	two	faces.	But	one	coin.	On	the	one	side	of	the	coin.
Is	the	nature	of	the	coin.	It's	your	nature.	God.
Absolute	infinite	being.	But	you	never	care	about.	The	value	of	the	coin.
You	see	the	other	side	of	the	coin.	Which	is	your	present	day	personality.	So	it's	better	to
see	that	you	are.
A	golden	coin.	With	some	value.	Because	we	have.
Variety	of	values.	In	what	we	call	the	coin.	As	money.
So.	Now.	What	is	the	most	precious	thing.
Given	to	us.	By	the	infinite	being	as	God.	Or	by	our	inner	nature.
Our	spirit	soul.	Because	we	emanate	also.	Mind	as	God.
But.	Now.	This	does	not	emanate.
From	our	personality.	Of	George	or	Mary.	It	emanates.
From	our	ego.	But.	Do	we	know	our	ego	now?	But	we	have	fixed	our	attention.
Too	much	on	our	present	day	personality.	A	creation	of	time.	And	a	certain	place.
In	space.	So	we	have	to	free	ourselves	from	this	illusion.	So.
What	do	we	understand?	One.	Can	gain	money.	Properties.

Owners.	Everything	around	him.	Calling	all	these	things.
His	property.	With	what	right?	Did	you	make	matter?	Never	mind.	Shall	not	discuss	that
matter.
But	what	is	really.	Our	right.	And	our	right	property.
We	are	not	giving.	Too	much	attention	to	it.	Our	mind.
Because	our	mind.	The	mind.	Expressed	through	us.
That's	why	I	call	it	our	mind.	It's	our	identity.	It's	our.
Little	self	even.	The	material	plane.	As	George	and	Mary.
Unless	you	lose	the	mind.	The	way.	The	one	way	or	the	other.
How	do	you	know	that	you	exist	and	you	are?	So	our.	Biggest	property.	Given	to	us	by
the	father.
Is	the	mind.	Our	daily	bread.	We	are	asking	for.
So.	We	have	to	use	the	mind.	Do	we	use	our	mind	as	a	reason?	All	of	us.
We	are	living	instinctively.	Like	all	the	other	animals	around	us.	What	does	it	make	us?
Feel	that	we	are	different.
From	the	other.	Forms	of	life.	Around	us.
Just	the	use	of	the	mind.	Expressing	ourselves.	As	a	self.
As	an	I-ness.	As	an	ego.	So	knowing	that.
We	value	life.	Because	as	a	spirit	soul.	We	are	life.
And	we	are.	The	everlasting	life.	Because	our	spirit	equals.
We	are	immortal.	But	not	as	a	personality.	So	we	reach.
To	this	point.	By.	Training	ourselves.
In	concentration.	In	the	right	meditation.	In	cleaning	our.
Present	day	personality.	By.	Introspection.
Or	looking	within.	Or	checking	the	nature.	Of	our	subconsciousness.
And	we	are	masters	of	it.	We	can	make	changes.	We	can	cause	this	change.

And	by	doing	it.	The	real	gain.	Is	to	realize.
Who	we	are.	And	so	we	advance.	And	advance.
Of	course	this	is	for	the	general	public.	For	everybody.	For	the	seeker	of	the	truth.
The	Brotherhood.	Has	more	complicated.	Exercises.
Which	cannot	be	used.	By	anybody.	From	the	public.
Unless	one	reaches.	Those	degrees	of	the	order.	Which	are.
The	innermost	center.	And	the	innermost	center.	Not	the	inner	center.
Because	even	in	the	inner	center.	Many	can	enter.	But	it	is	very	difficult.
To	enter	in	the	innermost	circle.	Which	is	three	degrees.	And	the	innermost	circle.
Which	are	the	three	degrees.	Leading	to	what?	Much	beyond.	The	real	self-realization.
You	know	who	you	are.	You	are	everything	else.	Spirit,	soul.
And	what	is	after	all.	If	we	reach	there.	To	become	most	powerful.
Matter.	Is	in	your	hands.	All	the	words.
Are	in	your	hands.	To	deal	with.	The	psychical	plane.
To	become	there	an	invisible	helper.	Entering	all	the	sub-planes	of	the	psychical	world.
With	authority.
To	help.	The	nautical	world.	Is	in	your	hands.
You	can	master	the	mind.	But	of	course	you	are	not	black	magicians.	To	influence	the
other.
Changing	their	mind.	Even	for	their	good.	Because	everybody	should	get	experience.
Mind.	In	each	step	of	the	development.	Is	the	devil.
To	persuade	you.	To	change	route.	That's	why	I	am	telling	all	the	time.
We	must	kill	egoism.	Because	egoism.	Is	the	worst	devil.
Because	of	all	good	evil	of	the	world.	And	present	itself.	As	an	angel	of	light.
As	the	bible	says.	You	must	be.	Just	cautious	to	see.
This	angel	of	light.	Coming	here.	As	the	sense	of	good.

Is	that	so	or.	It's	the	devil.	Which	means.
When	you	gain	the	authority.	Of	mind	reading.	Of	being	able	to	change.
The	minds	of	others.	You	don't	have	the	right	to	do	it.	Even	believing	that	you	are	doing.
For	their	good.	No.	They	are	on	the	stage	of	the	development.
They	should	have	their	lessons.	Interfere.	Free	them	from	pain.
Without	influencing.	Their	personality.	Now.
The	devil.	As	egoism	comes	to	you.	As	the	angel	of	light.
But	I	mean	good.	Dominating	over	others.	This	is	a	warning	for	the	seekers	of	the	truth.
Because	somebody.	Who	just	now	entered.	In	this	circle.
Said	yes	but	what	I	have	done.	I	have	done	it	to	myself.	Just	for	his	good.
I	said	stop	it.	But.	Stop	it.
You'll	get	his	lessons.	Advice	and	keep	silent.	So	the	first	thing.
A	seeker	of	the	truth.	Should	know.	Is	to	value	the	freedom.
Of	the	will.	Of	the	others.	And	allow	them	to	get	their	own.
Lessons	from	life.	Interfering	only.	To	minimize	the	pain.
But	not	to	change.	Their	dispositions.	Advising	them.
To	change.	Yes.	Forcing	them	to	change.
No.	Because	this	is	something	that	needs	much	clarification.	And	this.
Is	needed	by	everybody.	Many	parents.	And	some	of	them.
Think	that	by	forcing	your	will.	To	your	children.	For	their	good.
You	are	doing	your	duty.	You	are	wrong.	You	have	to	persuade.
Convince	him.	To	accept	it.	And	make	the	change.
From	inside	him.	And	not	by	compassion.	By	you.
Either	threatening.	Or	claiming.	Because	what	is	the	result?	Is	opposition.
Because	the	nature	of	man.	Is	to	oppose.	So.

Now	we	make	a	meditation.	Relax.	Completely.
Start	from	the	toes.	The	legs.	The	thighs.
The	abdomen.	Feel.	Your	body.
But	completely	relaxed.	Not	with	tension.	Start	breathing.
Deeply.	Feeling	the	lower	part	of	your	abdomen.	First.
And	then	the	lungs.	Then	emptying.	The	abdomen	first.
And	then	the	lungs.	Start	with	three	beats.	All	beats.
It	is	the	beats	of	your	heart,	yes?	I	beat.	In	breathing.	Out.
In	breathing.	Out.	In	breathing.
Out.	In	breathing.	Out.
In	breathing.	Out.	You	do	it	when	you	are	alone.
For	five	minutes.	Without	any	other	thoughts.	If	thoughts	are	coming	to	you.
Take	them	away.	Just	concentrate.	In	the	lungs	and	the	abdomen.
You	are	feeling.	Not	with	air.	But	with	etheric	vitality	also.
Later	you	will	just	see	it.	With	visualization.	Now.
In	breathing	four	beats.	And	out	breathing	another	four	beats.	Start.
Out	breathing.	In	breathing.	Out	breathing.
In	breathing.	Out.	In.
Out.	Do	it	the	next	day.	The	four	beats.
For	five	minutes.	Now	five	beats.	Start.
Out.	In.	Out.
In.	Out.	Do	it	the	other	day.
Again	for	five	minutes.	You	must	train	yourself.	Comfortable.
To	breathe.	And	feel	the	lungs	and	the	abdomen.	Now	six.
Start.	Out.	In.

Out.	In.	Out.
In.	Now.	This	kind	of	breathing.
You	should	get	accustomed	to	it.	And	then	after	the	course	of	time.	You	will	find	which	is
the	most	comfortable	for	you.
For	the	work	to	do.	I	prefer	the	four	beatings.	For	the	beginning.
And	later	the	six	beatings.	Don't	do	any	other	breathing	exercises.	You	find	in	yoga
books.
They	are	dangerous.	Just	holding	the	nostrils.	Breathing.
And	do	all	that.	Many	who	are	practicing	them.	Have	succeeded	to	break	down	their
nervous	system.
So.	These	are	the	safe	ways.	Of	breathing.
For	future	work.	Of	meditation.	Concentration.
These	ways	of	breathing.	Later.	Of	course.
With	visualization.	You	will	see	in	breathing.	The	vitality.
As	light	entering.	In	your	body.	And	when	you	take	out	the	other	air.
The	vitality	remains.	Only	the	air.	Comes	out.
Then	in	breathing	again.	You	load.	Your	body.
Which	is	the	etheric	double	of	your	body.	With	this	vitality.	And	see	it.
Because	the	seeker	of	the	truth.	Has	more	complicated.	Exercises	to	do.
With	the	breathing.	And	how	to	load.	The	etheric	double.
With	more	and	more	vitality.	And	then.	By	using	the	colors.
To	give	qualities.	To	this	etheric	vitality.	So.
Start	learning.	How	to	breathe	properly.
