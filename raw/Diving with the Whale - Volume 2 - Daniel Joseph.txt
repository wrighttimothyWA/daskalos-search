FOREWORD 
Divin
g 
tvith the Whale 
is a three part series on the 
intermediary teachings 
of Daskalos 
and the Researchers 
of Truth. 
In this series 
we will plunge 
more deeply 
into some of the most 
advanced teachings 
on God, Man and the 
Nature 
of Realit
y 
a,·ailable 
anywhere. 
The information 
contained 
wirhin 
these three volumes 
will 
add much mearung 
to any seeker's 
fundamental 
search 
for the 
t
ruth of who they are what they are, where 
they have come 
from 
and what the purpose 
of their life is. We will also answer 
some of 
the deeper questions 
such as:  What is Life and what is my way of 
life'  What is death? 
Where 
do we go after the change 
called 
death? 
Do we have a Soul? What causes 
our suffering? 
And 
most importantly: 
How can we reduce 
our suffering 
and live a 
happier 
life? 
Today 
we often hear the terms 
"outer 
self' and "inner 
self"; "lower 
self and higher 
self'. 
Bu, we do not have two selves! 
There 
is only one Self that extends 
from our Divine 
Nature 
as 
Spirit-Soul-Self 
to our Human 
Nature 
as a personality-self. 
As 
this Selfhood, 
we are on a marvelous 
journey 
traveling 
through 
the glorious 
but sometimes 
painful 
time, space and 
place worlds 
of existence. 
Upon 
the completion 
of these incarnational 
journeys 
we assimilate 
with our Real Nature 
and God. 
God speed 
on your journey, 
Darnel

DEDICATION 
The search for truth concerning God, man and the nature of 
reality is perhaps  the greatest undenaking one could ever engage 
in during their life.  It is a calling of many, the duty of some but 
really it is an underlying necessity for all. 
The gentle persuasion to all is to: "Seek the truth and the 
truth  will set you  free," because the truth sets us free from our 
suffering, which is born from an ignorance of the truth. It is with 
great  pleasure I  dedicate  this book to my family, friends and to all 
seekers of truth worldwide.

Chapter 1 
PIONEERS OF THE NEW SCIENCE 
We have spoken about the nature of visible light (light in 
the material world which is a range of etheric vibration that is 
perceptible to our eye).  We all  know  from  school any etheric 
vibrations that are higher or lower than the range perceivable by 
our  eye is what we call darkness. We also spoke of a main 
characteristic of the ether, and thus a main characteristic of visible 
light, called imprinting. The imprinting nature of light is what 
makes  sight possible on the material plane of existence. 
We gave the example of visible light striking on a tree, and 
that light is reflected back to our eye and contains a complete and 
perfect imprinted image of the tree's form and texture. Then, that 
image enters the eyeball, strikes the optic ner
Y
e and is converted 
into minute electrical impulses that register on the ,�sual cortex in 
the brain as sight. 
Once that visible light containing the image of the tree is 
transformed into electrical impulses it is no longer visible light. 
Now the electrical impulse carries the imprint of the image of that 
tree along the optic nerve to the visual cortex of the brain and we 
"see".  But there is no visible light in the optic nerve or the brain. 
All etheric vibrations and thus visible light has this imprinting 

quality by nature. This is true not only of light in the third 
dimension, but in all of the higher dimensions as well. 
Now in the higher dimensions we also have more abundant 
light.  There is the light of the fourth dimension Psychical World 
that some call the astral light. At a higher level there is the 
Noetical light of the fifth dimensional worlds. Still higher we find 
the Noetic light, which is what religion is calling the Everlasting 
Light or Inextinguishable Light. Scientifically speaking we can call 
it the Super-Light. 
Attuning to Noetical and Noetic light gives us profound 
understandings and inspirations. The phrase "The light of 
understanding" is a reference to knowledge and inspiration carried 
by the Noetical and Noetic light. 
Where is all this higher dimensional light? It is coexisting 
simultaneous throughout the entire material universe but it is 
vibrating at an octave higher than material light. So unless you 
can raise your consciousness high enough to reach the level of 
psychical and Noetical light, you will not be able to perceive 
anything of the reality of these higher dimensions. 
It is interesting to note that what mankind calls inspiration 
and understanding is so often associated with light. We have all 
seen the image of a light bulb illuminating over someone's head 
when they get a great idea. Great moments of scientific 

discoveries often come as flashes of insight. Gutenberg described 
his idea for the first printing press, "as if   it were coming on a 
beam of light". Einstein is said to have had his idea for the theory 
of relativity in a dream where he was riding on a beam of light. 
Scientific, artistic, and spiritual breakthroughs are commonly 
referenced as a kind of mystical light dawning experience: 
Because it is! 
In all of creation, there is infinitely a greater amount of 
light than what we can perceive with our material eyes.  In fact, 
there is no place where there is not light; it is maybe at a higher 
rate of vibration than we can see with our material eyes. But it is 
light.  In Christianity and other religions they call God -The 
Light.  For Christ, they say He is the Light from the Light. 
Since God is, that means the light is.  Since God exists the 
light also exists. Since God is omnipresent the light is also 
omnipresent. But of course this kind of light is not only the range 
of visible light. 
As stated previously, these higher dimensions worlds 
c
oexists and are intermingled with our three dimensional 
rea
lit
y
. 
But 
they exist 
in higher rates of vibration. These higher worlds 
exert influence the on the lower worlds of existence. 
This is what Plato was teaching 2400 years ago.  He was 
saying that all the forms we see existing around us get their shape, 
3 

definition 
and owe their existence 
to a higher state of reality of 
chat form.  He called this higher state the "World 
of the Pure 
Ideas". 
In our system 
we call it the Noetic 
state. 
In this higher 
'>; oetic state, 
we find the Archetypal 
Ideas for everything 
that 
exists.  Religion refers 
to th.is as the Divine 
Plan.  An Archetypal 
Idea contains 
the laws, causes and principles 
that govern 
that 
form of life.  Plato referred 
to the world of the Pure Ideas in a 
similar way.  Stating 
the transient 
life forms we see around 
us are 
like shadow 
cast from this higher reality. 
He gave his famous 
Cave shadow analogy 
to describe 
this. 
Today we could state this truth like this.  All the forms of 
life we see around 
us are like holograms 
that are projected 
from 
the Archetypal 
Ideas contained 
in the eternal 
Noetic 
State. 
The 
unchangeable 
Archetypal 
Ideas, Laws, Causes 
and Principles 
are 
permanent, 
whereas 
their shadows, 
the material 
forms we see on 
earth are short lived and temporary. 
All these material 
forms as 
well 
the mundane 
heavens 
and earth are not permanent. 
But the 
laws 
causing 
them and governing 
them are permanent. 
Christ 
stated 
it this way: " ... it is easier for heaven 
and earth 
to 
pass, 
than 
for one tittle of the law to fail." (Tittle means 
the 
smal
lest 
part of something) 
Now 
the Researchers 
of Truth are not 
teachin
g 
ima
ginary 
things. 
What we teach 
comes from centuries 
of 
researc
h and 
is 

confirmed by our own direct engagements with these higher-level 
realities. Really what we are teaching could rightly be called the 
science of sciences. The researchers of truth are pioneers of this 
new science. 
Our teachings are congruent with knowledge from the 
scie
nces but 
this knowledge is also more advanced that what 
sciences have discovered so far.  That is the textbook definition of 
mystical knowledge. Mystics are those who have knowledge and 
abilities beyond that of the common person. 
Let's talk about God. What are the prime characteristics of 
God? In its appearance as the trinity we understand God the 
father as the Total Wisdom and God the Son, the Christ Logos, 
expressing Total Love. We also understand God as the Holy 
Spirit 
expression 
of Total 
Power 
or what 
the Church 
calls the 
Almi
ghtiness. 
We see these Divine 
characteristics 
imbued 
in the 
arch
etypal 
ideas 
laws, 
causes 
and principles 
we just mentioned. 
T
hey 
are 
express
ed on earth 
and in the other 
dimensions 
as well. 
For 
exa
mple, 
we see the Total 
Love 
expressed 
in the 
material 
u
niv
erse 
as  the 
scientific 
law of cohesion, 
creating 
the chemical 
b
on
ds 
of 
matter
.  What 
is the law by 
which 
energ
y beco
mes 
ma
tt
er 
and 
m
atter 
converts 
back to energy? 
Science  found 
this out 

_ we are 
not 
teaching 
something 
opposed 
to orthodox 
scientific 
theory. 
�'here 
is the 
total 
wisdom 
in mater? 
It is the 
in motion 
and 
in  the 
harmony 
of the 
laws 
of order 
and 
balance. 
When 
science 
split 
the 
atom, they 
found 
a nucleus 
made 
of neutrons 
and 
protons 
with 
electrons 
orbiting 
around 
this 
nucleus 
- that 
is 
morion. 
Their 
different 
combinations, 
distances 
and 
speeds 
of 
the 
orbiting 
electrons around 
the 
nucleus 
are 
in perfect 
harmony, 
and 
that gives 
us  all the 
forms 
of solid 
matter. 
Despite 
the 
fact 
that atoms 
are 
made 
up of 99.9% 
of "empty 
space", 
they 
seem 
solid 
to our 
touch. 
These 
kinds 
of things 
have 
been 
proven 
by 
orthodox 
science 
in recent 
history 
but 
have been 
known 
by the 
mystics 
for 
centuries. 
For 
example, 
it was 
around 
1900 
that 
an American 
mystic 
named Blavatsky 
described 
and 
drew 
the 
internal 
structure 
of the 
atom, 
as  we know 
it today. 
This 
was 
a decade 
or so before 
Danish physicist, 
Niels 
Bohr, 
even 
suggested 
that 
an atom's 
electrons 
were 
confined 
into 
defined 
orbits. 
Now, 
looking 
at a solar 
system, 
what 
do we see? 
The 
same 
laws, 
causes 
and 
principles 
that 
govern 
an atom, 
govern 
an entir
e 
solar 
system. 
It is the 
same. 
The 
solar 
system 
has 
a 
nucle
us 
just 
like 
an atom. 
This 
nucleus 
is our 
sun 
of course. 
Llke 
the 
orbiti
n
g 
electrons 
around 
the 
I 
f 
nuc 
eus 
o 
an atom, 
the 
planets 
orbit 
at 
6 

different distance and speeds around the sun. Each planet is 
getting its proper  orbit  based on size,  distance and speed - this is 
the  total wisdom of God expressed in the material laws of order 
an 
balance. 
Just think our earth orbits 93 to 95 million miles from the 
sun. Any closer or farther away and life on  eanh as we know it 
would be  impossible. Just like the  eanh, atoms  also  have nonh 
and  south  magnetic  poles. Just like the atom the solar system is 
also 99. 9% so-called empty space. Could all these parallels 
between an atom and a solar system just be a coincidence? 
It turns out the "empty  space" of the universe is not really 
empty. Today physicists  speak of space as a quantum vacuum 
flux. They are calling this vast field of potentiality: zero point 
energy. 
Mystics 
refer 
to the energy 
of space 
as the cosmic 
energy, 
which 
they  have 
determined 
has nine 
main 
discernible 
frequencies 
and 
is present 
everywhere 
in space. 
There 
are many 
points 
in 
agre
ement 
between 
the mystic 
and the scientist 
concerning 
the 
nat
u
re of 
reality
. 
This should not be a surprise. Scientific research often 
comes to prove empirically what mystical research has previously 
stated. Or as a Sufi mystic said in the early 1900's: "What science 
realizes in  the  end, mysticism realizes from the beginning". 

For example, mystics in the distant past, in India, China 
and other places gave detailed information about the body's 
nerrnus system and the circulatory system hundreds of years 
before medical science discovered there existence. 
If you go deep enough into the research of both science 
and mysticism you will find that both are researching and 
discovering the same truths concerning the material universe. 
Yet we see different descriptions of the one reality created by 
different scientists, religions and mystics. Just think about the 
maps of North America drawn by the early explorers during the 
age of discovery. Those maps do not all look the same even 
though they all are attempting to depict the same reality. So it is 
similar with the scientific and spiritual explorers, they too draw 
different maps of the same reality based on their own 
Observations and perspective. 
This 
brings 
up an important 
point 
to remember. 
When 
we 
are 
researching 
the truth 
of anything, 
we must 
not be 
impatient. 
\X"e 
should 
not rush 
to conclusions 
or be overly 
excited. 
In the 
research 
of truth there 
is a need 
for rationalism, 
concen
tration 
and 
as we  progress 
we will correct 
our pre,�ous  views 
and 
understan
dings 
accord· 
l   W 
. 
mg 
y. 
e 
are 
continually moving on. 
We 
do 
not stop 
at any one 
point, 
because 
there 
is no 
end 
to the 

research of truth. We are always advancing. We are always 
ascending the ladder of relative truth towards the absolute truth. 
Day to day, week-to-week and year-to-year, orthodox 
science tends to prove the truth of mysticism. The great 
knowledge of the mystics and  researchers  though all the ages is 
being  proved by science using their method. Mystics find the 
proof of God in all the forms of life as expressions of Total 
\1(lisdom, Love and Power. 
Just think of the marvelous and complex work being done 
just in your material body in perfect harmony. This alone should 
be enough to convince us of the reality of Super Intelligence 
behind this great work. It does not matter if you call that God, 
the Absolute Beingness, the Super Intelligence or True Life. In 
fact, these terms come closer to the reality than the over used 
word  God. Just because we do not fully perceiYe God with our 
earthly brains it does not mean such a thing, as God does not 
exist. There is a life giver behind all the phenomena of life and in 
all the  phenomena of life. 
Loo
k at a 
seed, 
for example 
of a Eucalyptus 
tree. 
Its 
seed 
lo
oks 
like 
the  tiny 
seed 
of a mustard 
plant. 
It is 
smaller 
than the 
h
ea
d 
of 
a 
pin. 
Not 
even 
a scientist 
can tell them 
apart 
by looking 
at 
th
em
. 
Yet E
ucaly
ptus 
trees 
can reach 
a 
heigh
t of 200 
feet, 
h 
h   feet tall  So here we 
W 
ere
as 
a m
ustard 
plant 
grows 
one to t 
ree 

h
ave 
one 
of the 
smallest 
of seeds but it encloses 
with in it, 
the full 
set 
of 
instr
uctions as genetic 
code, necessa
ry to produ
ce a giant 
Eucalyptus 
tree. 
Give 
it the 
proper 
growing conditions 
and that 
single tiny 
seed will 
grow into a 
mature 
tree and produce 
a countless 
number 
of 
other seeds. 
Each one of those seeds contains 
the 
code for the 
entire 
circle of possibilities 
of its form of life.  No 
matter 
what 
kind 
of seed we have, it always 
gives us the same kind of 
plant 
and 
a multitude 
of more seeds of its own kind. 
Never 
can 
we sow 
one kind of seed and get a different 
kind of plant. 
An apple seed 
will always produce an apple tree.  Likewise, mankind has never 
seen a lion or any other animal give birth to a   different kind of 
animal. A lion always begets a lion, and a lion today behaves as all 
lions have behaved 
in all past times. 
This is due to the 
inescapable 
laws governing 
the circle of possibilities 
for each and 
every 
form of life.  We all see these different expressions 
of life, 
and 
according 
to the 
Christian 
Religion, 
it is the Holy 
Spirit, 
the 
giver 
of life that 
is the source. 
A Researcher 
of Truth 
studies 
both 
science 
and religion 
to reach the truth. 
What 
is the relationship 
between the 
researc
h of 
truth, 
orthodo
x science 
and orthodox 
religion? 
Does 
our 
rese
arch 
of 
tru
th 
con
flict 
with 
th 
d 
· 
· 
or  o 
ox 
saence
? It, m fact, comple
ments 1t. 
10 

We do 
not 
underv
alue the achievements 
o
f modern science, 
we 
learn from them. 
Does our research of the truth clash with orthodox 
religion? No! We agree with the teachings of those enlightened 
ones in the past who gave us religions.  However, we are not 
obligated to accept the religious prejudice and shortsighted dogma 
that for centuries have been heaped on all religions. 
Studying the different religions we can see that religion 
e
xplains the nature of reality just about as completely as science 
does, and  the religions reward their  followers with exactly the 
same thing that science gives their  followers - Certainty. The 
major difference is that science's certainty changes all the time -
Religion's certainty not so much. 
The research 
of truth is not a difficult 
way.  The 
t
hing you 
need 
most is to be honest 
w
i
th yourself. 
We need sincerity 
and a 
little 
time to study 
and practice 
each day.  In t
o
day's w
o
rld we all 
have 
access 
to great scientific 
and esoteric 
knowledge. 
But 
just 
b
eliev
ing 
what others 
say in blind fa
i
th 
i
s not 
satisfying 
to 
a 
rational 
person. 
Christ 
said, 
"Seek 
the truth and the truth will set 
you free". 
He 
did 
n
ot 
advi
se us to just believe 
what others 
say 
the truth is. 
H 
. 
uld fi  d   th 
th a
n

ther 
e 
did 
not say 
one person 
sho 
m

o
p
le 
fo

him blindly. 
This is a very 
i
mporta
n
t p
oint 
to 
11 

remember. Christ's gentle persuasion was that we must seek and 
find the uuth for ourselves. What does that truth set us free 
from, The truth frees us from our illusions, which is the source 
of our troubles, sorrows and despair. 
Of course in the beginning you may accept a truth from a 
wise authority or someone you love. But beware; you should not 
accept eyerything a person says without thinking about it. 
Personalitj• cults do this and as we have seen many times, they are 
quite dangerous. We must accept guidance from our teachers 
that we know to be honest and trustworthy people. But always 
we leave room for questioning. A Researcher of Truth should be 
like a burning question mark. 
So we have our system, a system by which we research the 
truth. Our system is just like the scientific method used by 
scientist. That means that the system we teach can be followed by 
anyone, anywhere and will give the same results regardless of their 
belief, nationality, or religious orientation. 
It 
is a positive 
and practical 
way to approach 
the 
truth of 
God, 
man and 
the nature 
of reality.

and 
the 
research 
of truth 
follow 
a similar 
path 
towards 
knowledge. 
O
ne 
branch 
of our 
research 
concerns 
the 
nature 
of reality. 
Th

to understand 
the

also

4th,

d
imension. 
The 
Church 
does 
believe 
in  them, 
but 
without 
kn
owing 
what 
they 
are. 
The 
Church 
just 
refers 
to these 
as the 
heavens. What the Church calls the seventh hea,·en is really the 
seventh  dimension. Even the most advanced mystics, who have 
been  able to reach this state, cannot express much about this 
luminous reality. They can say it is splendid, beautiful and 
glorious, 
but 
no 
earth 
language 
can 
adequately 
express 
the 
reality 
of 
the 
seventh 
heaven. 
Christ 
spoke 
about 
the 
Kingdom 
of the

not  just 
one

meant 

br 
the 
state
ment: "As a personality 
you live on

but 
as a 
Spirit Soul the earth lives in you". 
Let speak about the world we all know - our material earth. 
Earth is the first heaven. Going back before the time of Christ, 
rhe ancients believed and taught about the four building blocks of 
matter. These are the so-called four elements: Earth, Air, Fire and 
Water. Then Plato and his student Aristotle came along and 
began to speak of an additional element they called Ether. This is 
the first western public record we know about that mentions the 
Etheric element. Of course in India and other places they knew 
and taught about the ether long befnrp this.  In the India they call 
it Prana. Aristotle called the ether the Fifth Element. In his 
Greek language, the Fifth Element was pempte ousia". Later this 
became in Latin, "Quinta Essentia", which meant the "fifth 
essence" and that word eventually became the word 
"quinte
ssence" 
in English. 
Today 
quintessence 
means, 
the 
purest 
example 
of something. 
Certainly, 
Ether qualifies 
as the 
purest 
example 
of 
matter.  It is invisible 
to the eye like the air 
is and yet 
it 
is 
still matter, 
still 
part of the third dimension

Young, Thomas Young, demonstrated that light traveled in waves, 
through some unexplained medium. Scientists of the time 
correctly labeled this unknown medium the "Luminiferous 
Ether", which means light bearing ether.  Scientists at the time 
correctly theorized that Ether was an electro-magnetic medium 
that filled the atmosphere and outer space and was the carrier of 
electromagnetic waves. Now all this scientific speculation about 
Ether started a race to quantify it led by the top brainpower of the 
day.  At the end of the 1800's Albert Michelson and Edward 
Morley attempted to identify and measure this mysterious 
invisible substance. Unfortunately, when their rudimentary 
instruments could not detect Ether, conventional science seemed 
to lose interest in the idea of Ether as the fifth element. Yet in 
later years we still see great scientists like Einstein and Nicola 
Tesla confirming their belief in the Ether. 
For 
the researchers 
of truth, Etheric 
Vitality

�la}-be you have felt that scientific knowledge and mystical 
knowledge are opposed to each other because of their different 
approaches to finding the truth. On one hand, we have the 
esoteric knowledge of the mystic. Esoteric comes from the Greek 
� and means "knowled
ge 
from within us". Scientific 
knowledge is exoteric knowledge. Exoteric is also from the Greek 
and II mean, knowledllC that comes from the external outside 

wasted their time. The reason they could not rum lead  into gold 
was not that it was totally impossible buc because mankind had 
not advanced enough to reach such a state. 
There is an old :\luslim story about a simple, unassuming 
,-illager who had been able t0 learn hov.· t0 rum  lead into gold. 
Word spread of his miraculous ability and came ro the attention 
of the king, which interested him great!,·. The king immediately 
summoned the alchemist and asked him to re,·eal the secret for 
ruming lead  into gold and he would =,,an! the alchemist with 
an
ything he wanted. 
The alchemist said. ":-.o, You have found the wrong man". 
"But everyone tells me mu can do this", the king retorted. 
Again the alchemist claimed. "I do not knov.· such things, 
you have found the wrong person". 
So the king countered with, "Then I v..;J! put mu in prison 
for six weeks and if you have not told me by then. mu ,,,ill be put 
to death". 
The 
alchemist 
said. "Do what you like but 
I am  not the 
penon 
you seek". 
He 
was 
imprisoned 
and "'�- mo

E,·ery night the king also tried the opposite approach. At 
night the king took on the role of a prison guard and came to the 
alchemist and ser
v
ed him humbly. Each night the guard would 
bring the alchemist food, and care for him. He brought him 
blankets when it was cold and fanned him when he was hot. The 
king really became a loving servant to the alchemist and 
eYerything a person could do, he did for the alchemist. Six weeks 
passed 
like this. 
Then one morning the king came and declared, "Your time 
is up!  This is your last opportunity to tell me the secret, or 
tomorrow you die"! 
But the alchemist confirmed  once more that he did not 
know 
this secret.  That night the guard came to the alchemist for 
the last time and told him, "I am sorry I do not know how to save 
you .. .I only know how to serve you". 
The 
alchemist 
leaned 
over 
and whispered 
the secret 
of 
alchemy 
in the 
guard's 
ear and then 
said, 
"It is better 
for 
me to die 
than 
give 
the 
secret 
of alchemy 
to the unworthy
.  You 
are worthy
, 
the king is  not". 
The 
next 
day, the morning 
of the 
executio

the  king 
op
ened 
the 
prison 
cell and told the alchemist, 
"You 
are

you

alchemist 
said,

Now in this symbolic story we see two ways in which to 
approach gaining mystical knowledge. One is by demanding it, 
which never works. The other way is in becoming it.  The 
process the king went through to become the humble, loving 
servant is true alchemy. The king as the servant, did not really 
learn how to turn lead into gold, he rumed his heart to gold. This 
was done through the process of tbe king humbling himself and 
serving tbe imprisoned alchemist witb real love. 
We see in our society today that a tremendous effort has 
been made to advance materially by impro,ing tbe standard of 
living, which is good. This explosive material adnncement has 
brought a great increase in tbe quantity and easy of material life, 
but has it provided an improved inner quality to our life?  Are we 
happier? 
If we overlook our spiritual needs for tbe pursuit of 
material needs, we will not find lasting peace or satisfaction in life. 
Real spiritual growtb, real and lasting satisfaction requires 
harmonious and proportional achievements at all le,·els not just

dangers of progressing in science without developing humanity,

succeeding in business without developing ethics, or engaging in 
politics without having principles. These dangers are even more 
prevalent in today's world, just turn on the TV news and you will 
see. 
Now many of you have read un-official accounts about 
Daskalos' life. Some of you already know that once Daskalos did 
an Alchemy experiment. But to avoid any sense of materialistic 
gain, he tried turning gold into silver. I heard him tell the story 
this way. 
The day he tried this experiment he sent his children to a 
neighbors to play so he could concentrate on the experiment and 
not be disturbed. He asked his wife to stand guard outside the 
front door and not to let anyone come in or tell anybody about 
what he was up to.  Then he took his wife's gold wedding ring 
and went to his room and began. 
He explained the steps he went through and the specific 
process of how he changed the gold into silver at the atomic level. 
And he did manage to change his wife's gold wedding ring into a 
silver one. While he was doing this experiment, a couple of his 
students came to the house to see him, and his wife would not let 
them in.  However, as Daskalos  admitted, his wife  could not keep 
20 

this secret, succumbed to temptation of gossip and told the 
students what Daskalos was attempting to accomplish. 
After the experiment he emerged from the house to find 
his wife and the keenly interested students on the front porch. 
One of the students said, "W'e know \vhat you were tryin
g 
to do". 
But when they saw that he actually was successful it frightened 
them a bit and they soon left.  At which point, he turned and gave 
his wife back the silver wedding ring.  She immediately 
complained saying, "I want the gold one
l
"  So Daskalos changed 
it back for her 
As I said, an un,official version of this story was published 
in the late eighties. It came to the attention of an American 
interested in Alchemy. So this fellow got on a plane and flew to 
Cyprus to learn the secret of Alchemy from Daskalos. He 
requested to talk to Daskalos in printe and tells him he read 
about Daskalos work so he came to Cyprus. 
"Good, what branch of our teachin
g
s interest you?" 
Dask
alos asked: 
"Physical healing or psycho
therapy"' 
The Am
erican 
said, "No I want to learn how to turn lead 
into gold". 
Das
kalos 
asked, "Don't 
you want to help 
relieve the 
s
uffe
ring of people" 

The American brazenly admitted he did not care about the 
people he just wanted Daskalos to show him how to turn lead in 
to gold. 
Daskalos said, "I am not going to teach you this, besides if 
I did tell how it was done, you would not understand". 
The American reassured Daskalos that indeed he would 
understand if Daskalos would only tell him. 
Daskalos started laughing and said, "I will not teach you 
how to turn lead into gold. But I can teach you how to turn the 
lead in your heart into gold!" 
"I am not interested in that", the American replied and left 
Daskalos home thoroughly disappointed. 
For me this story reveals much about who and what 
Daskalos is.  He was not one to put a sharp knife in the hands of 
child, but he was one who would put a sharp knife in the hands of 
a surgeon who would do good works  with it.  In other  words he 
did not reveal the secrets of the teachings to curious or ambitious 
people. But he would diligently help any sincere seeker of truth, 
whether that person was a true believer or an atheist. 
This alchemy story also reveals the essence of the teachings 
of the Researchers of Truth, which is about the transformation of 
our personality's imperfect self-awareness in to the perfect Soul 
Self-Awareness. This is the aim of the Researcher of Truth and 
22 

this aim is called Self Realization. 
Which is the breaking 
of ow 
misidentification 
with the baser elements 
of our personality 
self. 
We do this by cleaning 
the personality 
of its fears, jealousies, 
hatreds 
and weakness. 
We do this in order to transmute 
our 
personality 
self-awareness 
into the gold of 
Soul-Self 
Awareness. 

Questions 
Q.  Daskalos 
mentions 
two different 
realms: Noetical 
and 
Noetic. 
Can you speak of the difference? 
A.  The word Noetic and Noetical 
come from the Greek 
word Nou, which means the mind.  The Noetic state has a higher 
and a lower part.  No words from any language 
can adequately 
describe 
this glorious 
realm.  Here is the home of the Archetypes 
of eYerything 
in coming 
into existence. 
These archetypes 
contain 
the laws causes and principles 
that govern everything 
in the 
worlds of existence. 
The Noetical 
Worlds 
also have a higher and a lower 
component. 
It is in the Noetical 
worlds that we first see the 
appearance 
of all the living forms of life.  By forms of life I mean 
bodily forms. Not the archetypal 
forms which are in the Noetic 
State. These Noetical 
worlds just like the Psychical 
worlds are 
made up of seven main planes of existence 
each with seven sub 
planes - 49  in all. 
The Noetical 
World is much bi
gg
er and brighter 
than the 
Psychical 
World. 
These worlds obey different 
laws.  The 
Noetical 
Worlds 
are in and around our material 
earth, the sun and 
our Solar System. 
Our entire solar system floats as it were in the 
'.'Joetical. 
But the Psychical 
worlds are not as big and they are 
24 

contained within and slightly around the earth and each planet, 
the sun moon and all the heavenly bodies.  So the psychical 
counterparts of each planet and the other heavenly bodies do not 
touch each other.  What about the Noetic World? It is literally 
everywhere -there is no place it is not.  All the worlds of 
existence, the material the psychical and the Noetical are all 
contained in the Noetic State. 
Now a book has just been released a few days ago, called 
the Hidden Reality by physicist Brian Greene. In it he shows how 
the mathematics of Quanrum Physics suggests that there are 
parallel universes coexisting simultaneously with the material 
universe.  The mystics teach of the Psychical World with its 49 
sub planes and the Noetical World with its 49 sub planes are the 
parallel universes they are theorizing about.  Of course Science 
has yet to prove to itself this is the reality. But this is just like  how 
decades ago the mathematics of Einstein suggested an expanding 
universe but that was only recently proven. How cenruries ago 
mystics in India, China and elsewhere were teaching about the 
circulation of the blood and the nervous system. This was 
hundreds of years before so-called Scientist "discovered" it, 
accepted it and could prove it.  So if you want to know what 
science will discover in the future - just look at what the mystics 
ar
e 
s
ay
ing 
now
. 

As you know, we receive etheric vitality through breathing, 
resting, sunlight, food, water and sleeping. But we also can 
recei,·e it directly from etheric vitality itself. We know we can 
consciously draw the vitality to us, shape and color it through 
,�sualization in our Meditation. We can increase our supply of 
this etheric energy anytime we want with this exercise. 
In this Meditation we will use this etheric vitality to 
harmonize and balance the body of our thoughts, the body of our 
emotions and our material body. This exercise can be done as 
much and you want, in the morning or at night. 
It is only necessary do it for fr:e to ten minutes at a time. 
Longer is not better in this case. 
OK, close your eyes now. Relax completely. Feel your 
whole material body. Have love and respect for your body .. .it is 
a gift from the Holy Spirit. 
Feel and see the luminous etheric double of your entire 
body. See it shine in and around your material body ... it is LIFE. 
Now concentrate and feel your toes. Feel that you are there in 
your toes. 
Breathe 
deeply 
but comfortably 
and move 
your 
attentio
n 
from 
the toes 
slowly 
up to your 
knees. 
Now 
you 
are fully 
concent
rated 
in your 
knees. 
Continue 
to move 
from 
y
our 
kne
es 
up to your solar 
plexus. 
26 

Breathe deeply and concentrate in your whole solar plexus 
area. Breathe in and see misty sky-blue light radiate from within 
your solar plexus and expand throughout your whole body. 
Now move your attention up to your chest area and feel 
being in your chest. See a beautiful rosy light radiating from your 
chest. Silence all emotions and all desires ... you feel only Love in 
your heart.  Love life!  Love yourself.  Lm·e all human beings, 
especially those who think they are your enemy.  Now consciously 
expand this luminous rosy light radiating from your heart and 
spread it over the entire planet.  Earth is your temporary home; 
See it covered in rosy-white light. 
Now move up to your head and see a brilliant golden sun 
within and around your head. Clear all distracting and unnecessar
y 
thoughts from your mind.  Have only creative thoughts in your 
mind.

Chapter 2 
THE 
LIFE 
AND ITS 
EXPRESSIONS
Wha
t is 
Life 
and 
what 
distinguish 
the 
difference 
between 
Life 
and 
the 
expressio
ns of Life? 
These 
are 
two 
different 
states 
of 
Life. 
Of 
course, 
Life 
is God, 
the 
Absolute 
Beingness, 
and 
the 
Absolu
te Infinite 
Reality. 
At 
the 
highest 
level, 
Life, 
Light 
and 
Lov
e  are 
synonym
ous. 
Life 
is  also  God, 
in its  plurality. 
However, 
Life 
manifest
ed 
as its countless 
expressions 
in all the 
worlds 
of 
existence is what we are calling the phenomenon of life. A 
"
p
henom
enon" 
is an a
pp
earance, 
some 
observable 
occurrence; 
whereas a "nounena" is the real  thing itself apart from the 
appearance of it as a phenomenon. This is what we were talking 
about in a previous lesson. That the eternal Archetypal Ideas are 
the 
New-Menon 
"nounena" 
that 
are 
the 
cause 
of, 
all the 
forms 
of 
life, which we are calling the  phenomena of life. 
We 
have 
two 
states: 
Life, 
Absolute 
Life 
and 
within 
it 
are 
the 
cou
ntless 
forms 
of the 
life, 
all the 
phenomena 
oflife. 
The 
o
ne 
state 
is Absolute 
Life, 
the  Absolute

your material eyes.  What we can understand is something of the 
Relati,·e Tmth that points us in the right direction towards 
Absolute Tmth, the Absolute Life. 
With all the expressions of Life in its countless diversity in 
all the phenomenon of life there are many stages and forms of the 
life.  It is obvious by looking that the life expressed in the plant 
kingdom is not the same as the life expressed in the animal 
kingdom, the human kingdom or the Archangelic life of the 
various Archangelic orders. These forms of life are different from 
Absolute Life.  But can we say the life of the Christ Logos is 
different from the Absolute Life?  No. 
As consciousness we are as cells in the Absolute Holy 
Spiritual Consciousness. But as Self Awareness, we are as cells in 
the Absolute Logoic Self-Awareness. Please notice these two 
different states - Self Awareness and Consciousness. The Christ 
Logos is the light, which gives us self-awareness ... at any level of 
development. But in our Divine nature we are not just cells, we 
are not just an expression of the life but we are also Life. 
So we have the self and the Consciousness. Then what is 
self-consciousness? Our self-consciousness is determined by how 
as self, use the Mind. Your self-consciousness is how you as self­
awareness, at any level, are using the Mind to shape and formulate 
your thoughts, desires and feelings. Your self-consciousness is 
30 

diff
erent from 
ever
y
one else's self-conscio
usness, 
which is to say 
y
our 
personality is different 
from everyone 
else's personali
ty. 
Thi
s is 
because 
the different 
qualities, 
quantities 
and combinations 
of 
your 
particula
r thoughts, 
desires and feelings are not exactly the 
sam
e as everyone 
else's.  A human being is the life but 
also is Life 
as 
a Holy 
Monad in the Multiplicity 
of the Absolute. 
So which form of life does our real Self haYe?  Not as an 
expression of the life from the Soul, because all that has a 
beginning and an end.  The Life of our Holy Monad is Absolute 
Life.  But this Holy Monad can and does extend into the worlds 
of existence by passing its radiation through the Human 
Archetypal Idea, forming the Soul, which in rum projects itself 
into the conditions of time, space and place.  Now it projects a ray 
of life into the worlds of existence as an expression of life. 
Everything in existence has a beginning and will one day will 
come to an end, but the Life behind any phenomena of life is 
everl
asting. 
This 
process 
begets the concept 
of On Toe Peisis 
"O
nto
peisis", 
which is a Greek word that basically 
means, "to 
b
eco

Ontopei

way up to the point returning back in Theosis. Theosis is seen 
from the point of view of the human being self, concerning his or 
her enlightenment, Self-Realization and unification with his or her 
Spirit Being Self. In returning back home through Theosis, we 
have been enriched, edified and become "fuller" than our 
Archangelic brothers who never entered the worlds of duality and 
only know of goodness. The human being returning through 
Theosis however, now understands good and evil, the light and its 
shadows. As a present-day personality we are Logoic life that gets 
its own unique experiences in these worlds of duality and thus, on 
its return, we retain the understanding of duality, which gives us a 
benefit the Archangels do not have of knowing both good and 
evil. 
As a personality incarnating in the three worlds of 
existence, we have our three bodies we use in these three worlds. 
The material body grows and develops Holy-Spiritually. Our 
psychical and Noetical bodies are also Holy Spiritual. Yet, as a 
means of expression of our Soul Self, these bodies have Logoic 
expression. It is the Logoic expressions that give mankind this 
form of self-awareness - the personality's self-awareness. 
However, this self-awareness is within the limits of time, space 
and place. While our real Self as Life is not within these 

conceptual limits, but  within the eternal present of the Absolute. 
This is an important difference to notice. 
This 
is one 
of those lessons 
where 
you 
need 
deep 
cont
empla
tion 
and Meditation 
to understa
nd 
this concept 
and 
exp
erienc
e it in 
a direct 
way. 
When 
you 
experienc
e the dawning 
of the 
awarene
ss of what 
you 
are, you 
will become 
disentangled 
with 
who 
you 
thought 
you 
were. 
In this experienc
e you 
have 
reach
ed to the 
level 
of the Permanent 
Personality, 
not 
as a 
hypoth
etical 
concept, 
but as your 
own 
Inner 
Self, 
clothed 
in your 
present-d
ay personality's 
self-awareness. 
We seek 
the point 
where 
the 
rwo 
states 
connect 
and 
are perceived 
as one. 
It is the joining 
of the present-day personality and the Permanent Personality. As 
we have  said  many times, a human being is like a line with two 
ends. 
From 
the middle 
to 
the one is our human 
nature. 
From 
the 
middle 
point 
to the other 
end is our 
Di,ine 
Nature. 
But 
we do 
not 
recognize 
this 
truth 
until 
we touch 
both 
ends 
of 
the line. 
Until 
this 
is done, 
we are not in a position 
to distinguish 
w
h
ere 
the 
pres
ent-da
y personality 
self is or 
is not, and 
where 
the 
Pe
rm
ane
nt 
Perso
nality 
is or is not. 
So a 
fundamenta
l task of  our 
r
es
ea
rch 
is to 
extend 
our self, 
up to the ends 
of this line. 
In 
rea
chin
g the ends 
of the line of our 
Selfhood, 
we will 
. 
. 
d ·     · 
le point 
on this line but 
n
ot 
co
ntinu
e to be only 
m
terest
e  m 
a sm
g 
o
n 
tw
o 
po
ints -
the bright 
luminous 
end point 
and the less brig
ht 
33 

end point. Now it is the bright point of our real Self that shows 
the truth to the less bright endpoint called our present-day 
personality self. Because the temporary personality's less bright 
end does not know the realit
y 
and therefore must learn the truth 
from the bright end, the real Self. As a personality living in a 
material body we can take off our clothes and say this is my body 
this is my clothing. The Permanent Personality cannot take off its 
expression, the present-day personality, and say this is my 
expression this is my real Self. So the only way to understand 
this is for us to reach and know both ends of the line called our 
Selfhood. Then the present-day personality will surrender its 
control and allow itself to be governed by the real Self. There is 
no other way. This is the way. 
Do we start concentrating on one end of this line and then 
proceed to the other end? No, we must simultaneously practice 
concentration on both ends of the line and not on any single 
point. If we only concentrate on one end we cannot compare, 
and we learn the truth by comparison. 
Our Soul-Self Awareness pulls memories up from the 
present-day personality's sub-consciousness, and from its own 
Permanent Personality's Self Awareness. Thus it can and does 
know 
everything concerning the life of the present-day personali
ty 
as 
well as that, which was in its 
past incarnations. 
This inner Sel
f 
34 

can bring such past life recollections up to the surface of memon· 
of the present-day personality. Those that have relieved past life 
experiences, insights and flashes  know this experience, so we can 
draw recollections from yesterday, last year, a hundred years ago 
or thousands of years ago. In all these cases we are onk drawing 
memories, whether it is from this life or many lifetimes ago.  Slow 
down and concentrate on this point: This recollection is not a 
revival of past events. All past events are simply the recollection 
of memories in to my own self in the present now. Here we are 
penetrating into  our Noetical body, which contains the 
recollections of the  past. This is a very great ability we should 
develop
. 
Now, let's go back to the lesson on Life: Life is Beingness 
and but exists as all the phenomenon of life in the worlds of 
existences. So we have Life in these two states of reality -
Beingness and Existence. In existence we see life infinitely large 
as all the life in the universe, but we can also find it in the 
infinitely small. Look at a drop of water under a microscope it is 
teaming with  life as viruses and microbes. The prime 
characteristic of life at both ends of this spectrum is  motion. We 
cannot really understand life except through motion and 
v
i
b
ra
tio
n
. 

Now science found out two things about the phenomenon 
of life in the material world.  One is that all life has movement, 
vibration. The other is everything must have a form in which to 
exist.  This is the relative truth but the absolute truth is still 
hidden. Scientists and mystics also know that for any 
phenomenon of life to exist it must have a cause that brought it 
into existence. Yet, the scientist still needs to realize that living 
forms of life are the expression of Life but not the Life itself. 
To reach the truth of this a scientist or a researcher should 
not just focus on the outer characteristics of an intelligent 
phenomenon of life's form and motion. We can call a   personality 
intelligent if that person can use his mind to think and understand 
the relative truth.  But even the most intelligent person makes 
mistakes. Is the  Absolute Intelligent Life making mistakes? No, in 
every phenomenon of life there is an expression of the Divine 
Intelligence and Almightiness. What is this Divine Intelligence 
and Almightiness but God?  We can understand God expressed in 
the worlds of existence as the life.  But can we conceive of any 
phenomenon of life  without a source of that life? Seeing a life 
form moving can you imagine that it moves without a source of 
energy? So for any form of life we must have a source and the 
source is the Absolute Life, even though Absolute Life is really 
incomprehensible to our material brain that does not mean there 
36 

are no other ways to know what Life is.  That means 
that as an 
incarnated 
human 
being you cannot understand 
it.  But when you 
realize 
you are Life and not only a phenomenon 
of  life, then you 
can know what Life 
is.  That means 
you must reach Se
l
f Super­
Consciousness. 
Christ 
said, "It is the Spirit that gives Life" and 
"God 
is Spirit". 
We give the example 
of God as the sun.  A sunray 
of light 
coming 
from the body of the sun is like the Spirit Ray 
of our own 
Selfhood. 
In nature 
these rays do not detach 
and become 
disconnected 
from the sun they remain 
connected. 
Similarly 
the 
waves 
on the ocean 
rise up to form seemingly 
separate 
waves, 
but 
they still remain 
connected 
to the body of the entire ocean and 
eventually 
sink back into to become 
one with the ocean. 
In a corresponding 
way we can say that the ray of our Spirit 
Self rises up 
from the entire 
body of Spirit, 
which is God.  In 
doing 
so it gains a seeming 
separate 
existence 
from the Spirit 
itself, 
which 
gave  rise 
to this Spirit 
Ray and, like the wave, our 
Spirit 
Ray of 
Life Light 
eventually 
returns 
back to its 
source. 
But 
u
nlike the 
wave 
when out Spirit Ray returns 
in 
unification 
with its 
sou
rce, 
God, through 
Theosis 
we retain 
everythin
g of our 
i
n
di
vid
uality -
nothing 
is lost.  TI1at is the 
nature 
of it 
all. 
The 
act
ual 
experie
nce of the individuali
zed 
seeming
l
y 
s
ep
ar
ate 
existe
nce of our personalit
y 
is differ
ent. 
37 
To the 

personality the experience is maybe metaphorically more like this. 
Let's say the entire life stream called the humanity is like a river 
flowing along as one integrated whole. Then it comes to the 
edge of a very high waterfall. Now when the river goes over the 
waterfall what happens? The unified stream of water fragments 
into billions and billions of individual drops of water as it falls. 
Each drop, let's say, is like a personality projected from Beingness 
into the worlds of separateness. Each drop, like our personality 
now has a temporarily and seemingly separated existence as it 
plummets to the bottom of the falls, in the exhilarating experience 
called incarnation. What happens at the bottom of the waterfall? 
The drop of water is destined to once again merge back into and 
become one with the river from which it came. This is a poor 
example that is not exactly right but the analogy shows something 
of the incarnation experience as perceived from the personality's 
vantage point. We have all heard that we are like drops of water 
from a large ocean. But when the water of the ocean gets 
separated in to individual drops some of them catch the light and 
sparkle brightly. These sparkling drops metaphorically are the 
enlightened ones who during their incarnation catch and reflect 
the light of truth to those all around them. 
Again, the etheric double is the mold in which and by 
which 
our bodies are 
built and maintained. This etheric 
double 
of 
38 

our bodies is indestructible and therefore not effected by our 
thoughts, emotions or actions.  Even the amputation of a fi nger 
or a limb from the material body does not affect the etheric 
double in the least.  However our thoughts, emotion and actions 
do affect the currents of etheric vitality coursing through our 
etheric double. Our thoughts and desires affect the flow of 
etheric vitality and its distribution to our material body through 
the etheric double.  We all have noticed that when we are 
experiencing feelings of strong fear, anxiety, and especially anger it 
weakens us.  It is powerful feelings such as anger and jealousy that 
burn vast amounts of etheric vitality needed by the Holy Spirit 
and Archangels to keep our body healthy. 
We have said many 
times that the etheric vitality has four 
main natures: the creative, which is not under our control but 
used 
by the Archangels 
for things like generating 
new tissue. 
We 
have 
the kinetic 
ether, which facilitates 
motion and movement. 
We 
have im
printing either which makes sight possible 
and along 
w
ith 
the 
kinetic ether 
make memory possible.  Then 
we have the 
ae
sthetic 
ether, which 
gives us the sense 
of feelin
g pleasure 
and 
p
ain. 
That is what 
anesthetics 
are all about
; they 
prevent us 
from 
c
on
sci
o
usly 
feeling pain 
or pleasure. 
W'hat we kno
w and 
u
n
d
er
sta
nd  is 
that God is Beingness 
and exists 
manifesting 
Itself. 
Wh
er
e 
d
oes 
it 
manifest?  It manifests 
in Itself, in 
Its 
39 

omnipresence, which includes of course, all the worlds of 
existence. It manifests  Itself; we say Itself because God is not 
expressing a male or female gender. So it manifests as the life­
Light. These two are really the same: life and light. 
In the Absolute Infinite Reality, in God, life is everlasting. 
So life is the nature of the Absolute Beingness. But who can 
understand that. Really nobody can understand that until he 
comes to understand his real Self as Spirit Soul as the life and the 
light. You cannot claim to know God without understanding 
your own Divine Nature. In knowing one you will know the 
other. 
What is the light? As we said before the full spectrum of 
light, the full spectrum of etheric vibrations is much, much more 
than the visible light we can see with our material eyes. Material 
light comes from the Sun, a flame or electric light. But can we 
say the light from a candle is the same as the light coming from 
the sun? Again maybe we can say that it is in nature but not in 
expression. 
Aside from a source like a sun, candle or lamp what is the 
underlying cause of material light? It comes from the element we 
call fire, which is something much greater than just a flame of fire. 
When the atoms of something material vibrate to a certain level of 
excitation, a certain frequency of vibration, we get heat, flame and 
40 

light. 
This is the 
trinity 
of fire: heat, 
flame 
and light. 
U
ltimately 
we 
can say 
that the element 
of fire is the 
Absolut
e Infinite 
Bein
gness 
it is 
the 
Absolute 
Total 
Wisdom. 
But the element 
of 
fire 
cannot 
be fully known 
by only using 
our 
brains. 
Yet we 
can 
see the 
manifes
tations, 
the presentations 
of the 
fire element. 
We 
can 
unders
tand it 
as motion 
(,�bration) 
and we see 
the effect 
of 
these 
vibration
s.  The material 
sun is ,�brating 
to those 
rates of 
vibrations we call the fire element. 
So 
we can say fire is a nature 
of the Absolute 
Beingness, 
but 
who 
or what 
is behind 
it?  Is there 
no intelligence 
behind 
the 
element of fire?  Could it be just a blind force? There are great 
intelligences manifesting the element of Fire when something is 
burning in  flames. These great intelligences are not entities but 
Beings 
in the Absolute 
Beingness. 
These 
Super 
intelligent 
Beings 
are 
thousands 
of times 
more 
intelligent 
than the smartest 
human 
being. 
They 
have 
a completely 
different 
kind of selfhood 
that 
what 
a human 
being 
has and we call these 
beings 
the 
Archangels
. 
By 
now, 
you all know 
the Archangel 
j\[ichael 
is associated 
w
ith 
the  fire 
element
.  Can we say that Michael 
is someho
w 
m
ani
fes
ting the 
element 
of fire? 
No they are 
not 
manifesting fire 
th
ro
u
gh 
so
me 
means. 
The element 
of Fire is 
the nature 
of the 
Ar
ch
a
ng
els 
called 
Michaels. 
They 
are just 
presentin
g this element 
from 
themselves. 
41 

What is the substance from which they present fire? It is 
the Mind, the M.ind Super-substance that emanates from God and 
from them. Because the Michaels are eternal Beings with in 
Absolute Beingness as we have said before. 
So 
in this way we have the element of Fire - heat, flame and 
light in all the worlds of existence. But is the fire element only 
burning and destroying things? Burning and dissolving things, yes 
but destroying things, no. As the mystic and the scientist both 
agree, mater cannot be destroyed but it can change states and rurn 
into energy. Energy becomes matter by certain processes and 
matter becomes energy by certain processes. So the process of 
burning is dissolving mater because a characteristic of heat and 
fire is expansion. 
The Archangelic order of Michaels, who are everywhere in 
the omnipresence of God present by their vibrations the element 
of fire. But not only on the material plane in the ways we 
understand the element of fire - heat, flame and light. But we 
also have the element of fire, and the other elements, in the 
psychical and the Noetical World. We have them at still higher 
rates of vibrations in the Noetic and in God, in the Total Wisdom 
of God. 
So how is the fire element presented in the Psychical 
World? We still have flame and some other different qualities. 
42 

Human beings are using these other qualities now, but sub­
consciously. Can you recall a time when you felt or saw someone 
in a fit of intense anger?  The enraged person screams and shouts. 
Their face gets red and their temperature rises.  That is psychical 
fire; and the psychical fire of anger burns vast amounts of etheric 
vitality. This is why angry fights with people drain both 
participants in the fight and they feel exhausted after the fight is 
over.  They are under the influence of a psychical fire within them 
and have lost control of this fire.  We say of such a person they 
are hot, they are on fire, their blood is boiling. These are all 
references to this kind of sub-conscious use of psychical fire.  So 
this is a purpose of our daily Introspection, to understand the 
Elements and learn to control them. 
There is no sun entering into the worlds of the 4th 
dimension, 
the psychical planes 
of existence. 
Yet within 
a 
person'
s own shell, 
good or bad, there exists wha
t
ever t
h
a
t 
person 
kno
ws from 
his earth life.  So a person in their s
h
ell hell 
or shell 
par
adise, may perceive 
a sun or anything 
else they 
knew on 
earth. 
S
uch 
a 
person may 
see a sun, or sun and clouds, 
or clouds 
c
ov
erin
g a s  un. 
So to   them they may 
experienc
e more 
or less lig
ht 
in 
th
eir 
pers
onal 
shell while residing 
in the 
Psychical World. 
Now 
as 
refe
rred to a question 
in the previous 
lesson, the 
Ps
y
ch
ic
al 
W
orld 
is self-illuminated. 
Unlike 
material subs
t
ance on 
43 

earth, every particle of the psychical and the Noetical substance is 
self-luminous. But in the Psychical World of existence we have 
the real planes and sub planes and we also have the individual 
shell worlds of each person residing in the sub planes of the 
Psychical World. This shell in one sense is boundless and in 
another sense, it is very, 
small and limited; yet it is the entire world 
for them. So by everything we notice and give attention to is 
creating elementals and by these we create our shell hells or shell 
paradises. So we are creating a shell world by our thoughts, 
emotions and by the way we are living now on earth. 
In the Psychical World the element of fire gives us light as 
noble emotions and it can give us the phenomena of a flame as 
well. Again ever particle of psychical substance that composes the 
Psychical World is created by the Archangels and emanates light. 
The fire in a person's own psychical shell is the way one is 
expressing one's self as activity, tensions, emotions and desires. 
Is the element of fire as light in the Psychical World 
dissolving substance as it does in the material world? In the 
material world we can burn something combustible. The element 
of  fire starts vibrating in the combustible material and dissolves it. 
The growth of a tree is made possible by the light of the sun. If 
you take a log from that tree and burn it, what remains after the 
44 

fire 
is a 
small 
about of ash?  So what happen 
to the rest of the 
log? 
.
All combustible materials whether solid, liquid or gas has 
the element of fire latent within it.  When we apply the vibrations 
of fire we get combustion or incandescence. This gives an 
emission of electromagnetic radiation we call material light.  So 
by burning the wood from a tree we are releasing the sunlight that 
has been captured and stored in the tree's wood. Where does 
released energy go?  It goes everywhere in the omnipresence of 
God. Fire in any rate of vibration is l\,[ind in a  specific state of 
existence. The element of Fire is not only in the material sun. 
The sun is a phenomenon that is giving the Fire element to the 
material plane. 
Fire in the Psychical 
World has another 
quality of gi,·ing us 
nourishment. 
The element 
of Fire in the shells of the   people in 
the 
Psychic
al World 
in the positive 
giYes something 
desirable 
-
int
ense 
activity. 
But in the negative 
it gives that 
person 
un
desir
able things like anger and 
aggressivene
ss in 
their 
p
ers
onality. 
Wate
r is 
and 
exists. 
It is  in the Omnipresence 
of God as 
Min
d 
S
upe
r-s
ubst
ance. 
As we said that a 
characteristi
c of Fire is 
e
xp
an
sio
n, a 
characteristic 
of water is 
contrac
tion.  Fire 
and water 
a
r
e 
t
he 
tw
o 
main 
Elements 
in the 
Mind 
Super-subst
ance, which is 
4; 

e,·erywhere. On the material plane we see their expression as two 
opposite Elements. But in their own nature they are not 
opposed. 
Now a new element comes forward between the elements 
of fire and water.  The element of fire is under the Archangel 
Michael's domain and its vibrations are giving us the range of the 
red colors.  Similarly the Water element is under the domain of 
the Archangel Gabriel domain and its vibrations are giving us the 
range of the blue colors.  This third Element's vibration is giving 
the color of violet in all its shades and is in the domain of the 
Archangel Raphael. So here is a  clue.  The colors red and blue 
give us the color violet.  So this third element is made by the 
union of the Michaels and Gabriels and thus contains both.  At 
the material level we call that element air with its energy 
component, the mind vitality; in India they call it Prana.  Because 
what you call air is more than just the mixture of oxygen and 
nitrogen, there is also the Element of Ether Vitality. So this third 
element balances the other element of fire and water.  The Angel 
Shamel provides the earth element to the Archangels. Shamel 
does not work on this element within our bodies; the higher 
Archangels work with and use the Earth element. All these 
elements and others are used by the Archangels of Creation in 
building up the three worlds of existence, our three bodies and 
46 

the etheri
c counterparts 
to these 
worlds 
and 
our b
odies. 
When 
w
e say 
"wo
rlds of 
existence
" we are not only 
talking about the 
w
orld of 
exist
ence we live in now, which 
is the 
three dimensional 
material universe. 
The 
matter 
composing 
the entire material 
universe 
is the 
low
est 
vibrations of 
these elements. 
In the material 
universe 
the 
ele
ments of fire, 
water, 
and energy 
have a more distinct 
state of 
existence 
than in the higher 
worlds. 
What we call energy 
is the 
easiest 
way to understand 
the Etheric 
in the material 
plane. 
So 
this is the work of the Holy Archangels 
regarding 
the 
creation and the manifestation of all the forms of life. Just 
studying the creation and the life forms, we see harmony and 
order we naturally come to the conclusion that there is an 
absolute 
super intelligence 
governing 
it all.  It is ruling 
everything, 
all 
the universes, 
the material, 
the psychical, 
the Noetical and 
eve
rything 
beyond 
them. 
When we study all that, we discover 
so
methin
g about 
the Divine Plan 
in the Worlds 
of 
Creation. 
Now 
a new 
point ... what is the Self?  Maybe we 
have 
t
hou
ght 
about this 
before 
without 
corning 
to 
a definite 
c
o
nclu
si
on. 
Is the Self 
the consciousness? 
As 
we said before 
in 
t
his 
le
sson
: self-consciousness 
is 
determ
ined 
by how 
we our 
self, 
us
e
s 
th
e 
Mind in the 
creation 
of 
thoughts and 
feeling
s
. 
Note that 
t
h
e 
S
el
f a
nd 
the 
consciousness 
are 
different from 
each other.  In

this lesson we also spoke about the Everlasting Life as the true 
Reality the "numenon" and the expressions of life as 
phenomenon. This is the same: we have the Self as the true 
Reality and the consciousness as phenomenon. 
Can the Self be and exist without the manifestation of 
consciousness? Let's think: what creates the phenomenon of 
consciousness? It is the Mind Super-substance. The Mind is not 
the Self and the Self is not in need of the Mind in Beingness. But, 
for the Self to express itself in existence as a personality, it needs 
the Mind. So consciousness is an expression of the Self. 
Looking at the personality we see that it is the real Self 
enclosed by the Elementals we have created from the various 
Elements. Freeing yourself from these Elementals you will be 
able to see your real Self.  But without the elementals that form 
the personality is our Real Self now formless? No we keep our 
human form, which at this level is not a body. Now we can 
understand that Self differently than when it was using the 
different states of Mind as consciousness. Now we are in a better 
position to be able to separate the Self from its manifestations as 
self-consciousness. This subtle difference has gone unnoticed by 
many now and in the past too.  Some Eastern systems even state 
that when our consciousness ceases, we ourselves are lost; we are 
annihilated in the nothingness of Nirvana. But does our real Self 
48 

vanish 
just 
because that Self 
is not using the 
l\'.lind to express itself 
self?  No, that is not possible. 
So we 
under
stand that the Self is the Spirit 
and our Human 
F
orm is 
the 
Spirit-Soul Self. 
This Self 
is imm
ortal and completely 
i
ndep
endent 
of the Mind.  But again this real 
Self uses   the Mind 
as a 
means of expressing 
itself in the dual worlds 
of existence. 
We 
are dual, 
dual in one.  Being an immortal Self, 
expressing that 
Self through the elementals we create in all the Worlds of 
Existence. 
The researchers of truth must study this in contemplation, 
mediation and Introspection to find his or her Real Self. This is 
called Spirit Observation. We will not reach Self Realization 
without this study. This study is more than just studying what we 
already basically know.  We need to start a new investigation along 
these lines.  That means Introspection. Sufficiency 
Inspectio
n means looking within.  Looking within the 
pers
onality self at 
first, then 
go beyond the personalit
y 
to observe 
t
hat 
your 
Real Self is hidden within °'·en your 
personality
.  At this 
p
oint 
we 
are in a 
better position to free our sense of 
self from the 
p
erso
nality 
self that is composed 
of element
als.  Find 
that 
my
sterio
us Real Self of 
yours.

Question 
Q. I  sincerely would like to know about people with 
substance abuse, if when they are enraged do they create bad 
elementals .. .If you could explain this I would deeply appreciate it 
A. When anyone is enraged  whether they have substance 
abuse problem or any kind of problem, they create very negative 
elementals. The angrier and more they express the rage they feel -
the stronger the elementals they create. The intensiry of a 
person's energy and the number of times it is repeated, gives 
power to the elemental they form with their thoughts and 
emotions. With every expression of rage they send out, these 
elementals get stronger and form into large groups of elementals, 
which eventually return to the person who sent them - this makes 
the situation much, much worse. 
Of course these are quite dangerous to the person, but they 
are also very destructive to the lives of family members and 
friends who love and care about the afflicted person. Often the 
kind and quantity of elementals afflicting a person with substance 
abuse create such discord they cause a tonurous psychological 
division between the person and their family and friends. In an 
act of preservation, these elementals seek to separate the person 
they host on from those around them who try to help. 
50 

They seek to divide and cause conflict. This is how those 
elementals feed, grow strong and continue their life.  They feed on 
the attention of the person sending them and the feed on the 
attention given to them by that person's friends and family. This 
is why one should never fight directly against an elemental 
because: If you fight against elementals you will lose. 
So if you are facing an enraged person sending negative 
elementals - don't struggle and fight against that person because 
this energy and attention ends up perpetuating the conflict as well 
as the elementals driving the conflict. But do not be a doormat 
either.  Most of the times it is best to stop, step back and let 
things cool down for a while. After things cool down, then try 
talking with the person in a loving and reasonable way and you 
will have better results. As Daskalos simbolically advised, don't 
try to pick a piece of metal when it is hot, it will only bum your 
hand. Instead, wait until the metal cools down then you can do 
something with it without getting burned. 
Q. Within the past year or so I've read the New Testament 
a couple of times and even though I found it remarkable I also 
found it to be   somewhat confusing, especially the parables. I 
bought Daskalos' Parable book, which sheds light on the stories 
and it started to make a lot more sense. I am now reading the Old 
51 

Testament and I am several pages into the book of genesis. And I 
thought I was confused with the New Testament. 
I feel like I'm missing something. Either the world on the 
material plane was a very different place back then when God 
seemed 
to be a bit more of an angry God wiping out civilizations 
with floods and all that. Or the other thought I had was that all of 
this was not actually happening in the material plane but in the 
psychical and/ or Noetical planes. I would greatly appreciate if you 
could shed some light on this whole thing for me. 
A.  It does not take a biblical scholar to realize the angry, 
jealous, vengeful God of the Old Testament bears no resemblance 
to the loving, merciful; father God of the New Testament spoken 
of by Christ. The Old Testament is the earlier scripture of the 
Jewish tradition prior to the coming of Christ. 
For better or worse these rwo diametrically opposed views 
on God have been merged in to one book we now call the Bible. 
Christ said he did not come to abolish the old Jewish laws and 
teachings but to fulfill them. He did not try to destroy the pre­
existing Jewish Ten Commandments, which are really 
commandments of prohibition. They are prohibitions because 
virtually all of them start with "Thou Shall Not" Whereas: the 
only commandments given by Christ were gentle persuasions. 
52 

They are: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with 
all your Soul and with all your mind."  This was the first and 
greatest commandment. And the second commandment was like 
it, which stated: "Love your neighbor as yourself'' ...  because 
ultimately your neighbor is yourself. 
But for the stor
y 
of the Garden of  Eden, you are right. 
That did not happen on the material planet but in the etheric 
counterpart of Earth just prior to humans coming to the planet. 
It says in the bible that Adam and Eve were given "Tunics of 
Skin"  and cast out  of  the Garden of Eden by Archangel Michael. 
Leaving the garden means they left the paradise of the Etheric 
counterpart of Earth, and put on skins, which means they 
incarnated on earth in a material body covered in skin. And the 
apple in this metaphoric story represented Earth. 
There 
are 
great 
teachings 
in the 
Old 
Testament, 
but 
they 
are 
more  easily 
understood 
as a symbo
lic depiction 
of the 
truth, 
o
the
rwise 
they 
do not 
make 
much 
sense. 
For 
example 
Moses 
go
es 
up the 
mountai
n and 
receives 
the 
Ten 
Commandme
nts from 
Go
d. 
The 
sixth 
command
ment 
states 
"Thou 
Shall 
Not 
Kill". 
O
nc
e 
Mo
ses 
gets 
the 
commandments 
from 
G
od he comes 
down 
th
e 
m
ou
ntai
n and 
sees 
many 
of his followers 
worshipi
ng idols 
in 
t
h
e 
ol
d 
wa  y, 
which 
he prohibited. 
Mose
s' 
"anger 
waxed 
hot", 
he 
t
h
r
o
w
s 
do
wn 
the  stone 
commandm
ents 
breakin
g them. 
Then 
he 
53 

orders the followers who did obey him to slay by the sword 
"eYery man and his brother, every man and his companion and 
every man and his neighbor",  slaughtering 3000 of his disobedient 
followers. Does that actually make sense to anyone? Or should 
we believe that God gave a commandment not to kill unless of 
course others were not obeying us, then it is ok to kill them. 
As Daskalos revealed, this was a symbolic killing of the 
disobedient elementals within Moses. So try to view the accounts 
in the Old Testament as a   symbolic story. That does not mean 
some of these things did not happen. It just means that the 
authors wrote them down in a symbolic way to convey a higher 
meaning. 

Meditation 
In this 
cont
emplatio
n-mediation 
you will ask 
a question. 
But 
do not give 
a reply from 
your personali
ty. 
Fearlessly 
expect a 
repl
y tci 
come in its 
own time, but not necessary 
when you ask the 
question. 
Relax your material body and your psychical body. Be really 
relaxed, with no feelings, thoughts, desires or emotions to disturb 
you.  Your only thought is that you are you, now living in the 
material body and feeling that you are fully in    your material body. 
You are you in your material body. 
Say_ silently to yourself: I am I... I am I... I live in my 
material body having my name and under all the influences of my 
intentions, desires, and thoughts. But, all these things are not my 
Self.  My Self is different. My Self is not just an entity changing all 
the time whose body changing its shape and changing its 
emotions, its desires, its intentions, and its particular way of 
thinking. 
Silentl
y ask 
yourself: 
Who am I? 
Who am I 
who can 
ch
o
ose
, can 
reason, can meditate 
and study? 
Who 
am I who can 
le
ar
n 
thi
ngs 
that I want to know? 
How often 
have you come 
to 
kno
w 
so
methin
g and have 
the feeling 
that I always 
knew 
them? 
It 
wa
s n ot 
something 
totally 
new to 
me. 
All 
of 
you 
had 
this 
fe
e
lin
g 
at 
some time. 

"Yet, who am I?  One day I will leave my material body. 
Am I this body? After my body dies, will I stop being and 
existing? Should I be afraid of that change called death ... the 
death of my body"? 
In the New Testament, Joshua Emmanuel the Christ the 
perfect God and yet a man said that there is no such a thing as 
death of the personality or of the Spirit-Soul. He said: "Don't be 
afraid of those who can kill your body, they can do nothing to 
your Soul." 
Am I the body or the Soul? This body will definitely die 
one day. I am living in it now but c-,er
y 
day it is changing and 
getting closer to its death. 
Now think: I have lived in my body when it was only an 
emb
r
y
o in the womb, then as a child eventually growing to an 
adult, to the age I am now. Still this body of my body continues 
to change every day.  Who is it living in this body who is not 
changing? It is that mysterious Self, the 'I am I', that innermost 
Self.  Does that I-ness cease to exist after the death of the material 
body? Is there any proof that I do exist after the death of the 
material body?" 
Yes. Read it in the holy Bible. Joshua Emmanuel the Christ 
had healed the body of a boy in Nain who had passed over by 
cholera. Although being dead for four days, He healed the body 
56 

and 
called 
the 
Spirit-So
ul back 
in  to it.  This 
is 
in the Bible. 
He 
had 
done 
that 
to Lazarus, 
whose 
body 
had died 
and w
as also 
in a 
g
rave 
fo
ur days. 
He 
had 
called 
the Soul 
of L
azarus 
back 
into 
the 
body and resurrected the body. 
There are many, many other instances of the resurrection 
of the body and of the calling back of the Soul to its material 
body, which had been dead. This is the proof that our Soul-Ego 
Self is not annihilated by the death of the material body. 
And of course we have many, many  accounts of people 
having died and being certified as dead by medical professionals. 
And then they come back in to their body and confirmed things 
that occurred around them after their body was declared officially 
dead  that they could not have been known unless "they" did not 
die even  thought  their body was pronounced dead. There are 
countless numbers of these near  death experiences reported by 
reliable professionals from around the world. 
Now ask  sincerely: Who am I? By doing this kind of 
contemplation over time and with other exercises in Introspection 
and visualizing you'll get to know the nature of your real Self. 

describe three different characteristics of the Etheric Double and 
how with just a little training you can learn to use them to increase 
the strength vitality of your body and promote healing in your 
body and in the material bodies of other people. 

Chapter 3 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
For anything to exist, it must have an Etheric Double. 
Everything existing in the natural world from a grain of sand to a 
worm, a bird, a human body, or an entire galaxy has an etheric 
double. Nothing in the three worlds of existence can exist 
without its etheric double. Because the etheric double is the 
mould in which and by which that form is created and 
maintained. The etheric double of a flower is a mould or matrix 
governing the creation and building up of the physical flower. 
The etheric double of a flower is quite different than the etheric 
double of a human being. They are not of exactly the same 
composition. 
What are etheric doubles made of?  Everything is Mind 
manifested at different frequencies of vibration. Matter is Mind at 
its densest level of vibration, giving us  the sense of solids, liquids 
and gases. Does  this mean the etheric double of a material plant 
or a human material body is actually physical matter? Or is the 
etheric double of a material body psychical in nature? The 
etheric double of any physical form, although invisible, is 
considered matter in its highest rate of vibration. Similarly, wind 
is invisible but it is still considered mater and thus part of the 
t
hir
d 
di
mensional universe. 
59 

We have described our three bodies: the material, the 
psychical and the Noetical body. For a material human body the 
etheric double starts from inside the spermatozoa and as a mould 
it starts building the material body. Every cell, every molecule and 
eYery atom has its own etheric double. Every organ, every part of 
the body and the body as a whole must have an etheric double in 
order to exist. In reality we have an amalgamation of etheric 
doubles that composes the whole of our etheric double. This is 
also true for the various life forms in the material world. 
What about forms of life in the psychical and Noetical 
World of existence? Do they have etheric doubles too? Yes, as 
we ha,·e an etheric double in and around our material body we 
also have them in and around our physical body and Noetical 
body. We have three bodies and three etheric doubles. The 
etheric double of the material body is similar in substance but at a 
higher rate of vibration. The etheric double of the psychical body 
is similar in substance but it vibrates at higher rate of vibration. 
Likewise the etheric double of a Noetical body is similar in 
substance but vibrating at a still higher rate of vibration. 
It works like octaves in music - same notes but those notes 
can be played in higher or lower octaves. The etheric double of 
the psychic
al  body is vibrating at an octave higher than the 
ethe
ric 
of 
a material 
body. The etheric double of a Noetical 
body is 
60 

vibrating at an octave higher that the psychical body and two 
octaves higher than the material body. The expressions of all 
these etheric doubles are similar; they follow the laws of the four 
elements because the bodies they govern are under the laws of the 
four elements as administrated by the four prime Archangels of 
the Elements. These are the Michaels, the Gabriels, the Raphaels 
and the U riels. It is like the etheric doubles are the workshops of 
the Archangels, and Holy Spirit in building our bodies. They 
cause  changes in the material bodies through its etheric double. 
What ages a material  body? Do your think it is Time? 
Science tells us that after seven years not one cell in our material 
body is the same. That  means, as a material body composed of 
various cells  we cannot be more than seven years old. So what 
about 
our thoughts 
and emotions? 
They 
are changing 
all the time 
too. 
You  do  not 
have  the  exact 
same 
thoughts 
and feelings now 
that 
you  had 
as a child. 
Nor 
are the thoughts 
and emotions 
you 
har
bour 
and  express 
now  going 
to be the same 
as you 
have 
as an 
elderly 
person. 
It 
is the 
etheric double 
that is causing 
the aging to 
the 
mat
erial 
body 
according 
to the Dh�ne 
laws -
accor
ding to the 
Cir
cle
s 
of 
Poss
ibility 
of a human 
body. 
What 
does 
that 
mean? 
It

double

su 
sta
nce o 
e 
t
h
e 
s
a
me, 
they 
diffe
r in composition. 
It is just like 
materia
l bodies 
61 

their substance is the same but what about the quality. The 
quality of the material body of all human beings is not the same 
and neither are their etheric doubles. So it is all about quality. 
In what way is the etheric double of an animal different 
from the etheric double of a human body? The etheric double of 
any material body is vibrating, creating movement in the body. It 
causes circulation of the blood and metabolism. This is the same 
in a human body or the body of an animal. Yet their life is 
different. The circulation of their blood is different in a bird than 
in a human body. We have a different kind of circulation in trees 
and plants yet both are the movement of liquids (blood and sap). 
So the vibration, the motion and substance is similar. But the 
composition and combination of any etheric double of any body 
is specific to what it will create and produce. 
The characteristic of the etheric double of our material 
body is the life giving principle in the material body. This life 
principle of our material body is not our life, because our life as a 
present day personality also depends on the etheric double of the 
psychical body. But the life of the material  body  depends on the 
etheric double of the material body. 
The Holy Spirit and the Archangels regulate the 
movements, combinations of elements and vibrations through the 
etheric double independently of our awareness or the way we are 
62 

living.  A material body with all its organs is built atom by atom 
through the etheric  double. Since the body's organs are very 
different from each other in composition so too are the etheric 
doubles of the organs different in terms of function. 
Now here is a great mystical principle. Material bodies are 
not built up and sustained in a cumulatiYe way. Material bodies 
are  not created by addition from the food they consume. The 
food we eat provides energy and vitality but the building comes 
from  the center of each  atom outwards. Such great wisdom is 
expressed in the creation and development of a material body. 
This  is  the work of the Holy Spirit and the Archangels in the 
etheric double and should be respected and not wasted. 
What kind of use are we making of our etheric double? 
The life of the material body and its etheric double is really 
independent of our life as a personality. Yet we are using the 
energy of the Etheric Double in the way we are living. So we are 
using the Etheric Double subconsciously. 
The 
work 
and 
functions 
of  the etheric double 
is 
separated 
i
nt
o fo
ur 
natu
res 
or  characteristics. 
There 
are more 
than 
four 
but 
for 
no

we 
just 
teach 
about 
the first  four.

T
his is 
because

63 

We are also using the mind in expressing emotions and 
desires, but in this case it is the etheric double of the heart is the 
center we are using subconsciously. So as personality we are 
using the etheric double of the brain and heart centers. Now take 
notice to this next statement. The center in the heart is 
connecting the etheric double of the material body and the etheric 
double of the psychical body. So that the vibration of our 
emotions come through the etheric double of the psychical body 
to the etheric double of the material body and create an influence. 
Think of a time when your heart was full of love, that vibration of 
love created harmonious influence� on your body through the 
etheric double. It is the same with anger or any other emotion. 
Now we come to the real work. We have to wake up and 
start observing the way we are feeling and behaving. With 
patience and sincerity we discern the reasons we behave in certain 
ways. What is it that makes us angry and more importantly why? 
Why does a certain thing shake us up so badly? What is it about 
this thing that really gets under our skin and causes violent 
psychical vibrations in us? 
Studying all these things and coming to real conclusions, 
we may say "Wow, I really thought I knew myself as a 
personality". We may ask, "Who am I really?" Now we realize 
that we need to study more to find that out. So we start using the 
64 

eth
eric 
double as Imprinting 
Ether in v
isualiz
ing.  W
ith the 
Ki
netic 
Ether 
we retrieve the memories 
needed to 
observ
e our 
o
wn 
behaviour in 
order to catch our egoism. T
his is 
v
e
ry 
i
mp
ortant. 
There are more etheric centers in the etheric double over 
organs such as the liver, and the lungs and so on. These centers 
do not concern us as much as the four primary centers on the 
spinal column. We are not using these other organs of our body 
consciously. The Holy Spirit and Its Archangelic emissaries care 
for and govern these organs through the Creative Ether.  Human 
beings at this time do not have use of the CreatiYe Ether unless 
they are well-trained mystics and God has granted it to them. One 
should not expect that the Holy Spirit would grant you the 
creativeness 
of this ether unless you are worthy of it.  You have to 
work to be worthy it. But when this happens, the mystic learns 
how to make materializations and dematerializations. 
We 
all have 
other qualities of the etheric that we can 
use, 
su
ch 
as 
the 
Imprinting Ether.  Imprinting 
Ether 
makes it possible 
to 
use 
the 
Super-Subs
tance of the Mind 
in 
creating 
eleme
ntals. 
We 
are 
usin
g the 
Imprinting 
Ether now 
but m
ostly 
sub­
co
ns
ci
ous
ly. 
But with a little effort, 
we can 
start 
to use 
it 
consciously and have better results. 

Another quality of the Etheric Double is the Kinetic Ether. 
Kinetic is from the Greek language and means movement -
motion. We can simply not understand any form of life without 
movement. Motion - movement is the nature of God who is the 
author of all life. We also use the Kinetic Ether sub-consciously. 
Small children do not know how to walk. So they learn sub­
consciously how to control their physical body and move from 
one place to another. The autonomic functions of the body such 
as blood circulation,  breathing and so many others are all made 
possible by the Kinetic Ether. All of this is constantly under the 
supervision of the Holy Spirit and Archangels. 
The remaining quality of the Etheric Double that we are 
able to control is the Aesthetic Ether; this ether gives us the sense 
of  feeling. All through our life we are using  this  ether  sub­
consciously feeling our body and also that we are living in our 
body. When you bring the Aesthetic Ether  under  your control 
you can remove pain from your body and others. When you feel 
any part of the material body you are really using the Aesthetic 
Ether of the Etheric Double of your material body to feel it. 
So we have the three qualities of the Etheric Double we 
can use 
separately or together. If you move your leg 
conscio
usly 
and 
feel its 
movements, you are using the Aesthetic 
Ether and 
the 
Kinetic 
Ether. But if you move your leg and are 
thinkin

v
ement 
then y

a

the Kinetic 
Ether 
without 
the Aesthetic 
Ether. 
As we

In our training 
we learn

But it takes 
real sincerity 
on the part of 
our 
personality 
to disentangle

learns how to create such logoic elementals with faith, we as a race 
will be able to do things that seem incomprehensible to us now. 
Christ pointed this out when he said, "I tell you the truth, if you 
have faith and don't doubt you can do things like this and much 
more. You can even say to this mountain, 'May you be lifted up 
and thrown into the sea,' and it will happen." 
It is permissible for a Researcher of Truth to give birth to 
elementals through their Etheric Double as long as they are not 
deaf and dumb spirits but spirits for good. Up to now most 
people have been misusing their Etheric Double by sending off 
legions deaf and dumb elementals. All elementals return back to 
their creator, and when the undesirable ones return they inject and 
infect the person's etheric double. This creates  imbalance, and a 
chaotic sub consciousness, turning that part of our mind into a 
dangerous jungle. This means that every human being is in a 
condition of his or her own creation. When the elementals are 
negative, this condition is like a prison, which they have built 
themselves brick by brick - or rather elemental by elemental. 
When the elementals are good and positive the condition created 
is like a paradise full of benefit. In either case it is the person 
creating these conditions by the thoughts and emotions they 
harbor and express.

So
me 
people are 
not susceptible 
to an illness 
and other 
p
e
ople   are 
catching that 
illness - why?  Why 
are certain 
people 
im
m
une to 
certain illnesses? 
And what does 
it mean to 
be 
im
m
une?· There 
are germs, microbes 
and viruses 
around all of us; 
wh
at 
deter
mines if we catch 
them or not?  It depends 
on the state 
of the etheric double of the material body. 
If you look at a dead body anyone can see that the so-called 
"life-force" is no longer animating that body.  It is no longer 
gi
ving life to that material body. The Etheric Double of our 
material body is energy; electromagnetic Yitality and we know its 
nature. The Etheric Double is the principle behind all the 
phenomena of life in the material universe. But the Etheric 
Double is not Life itself.  It is not the source of life but it is under 
the authority of the source of Life.  But the etheric ,�tality is Holy. 
It is the Holy Mind vibrating at specific rates of ,·ibration just 
above matter. We must come to know it and be able to use it. 
We 
have said 
before that 
the Etheric Double cannot 
leave 
th
e m
at
erial 
body 
because 
if it did the body would 
die and start to 
de
ca
y. 
Yet 
in 
doing certain exercises 
for the whole 
body using 
t
he 
diff
ere
nt 
quali
ties of the Etheric 
Double 
we can 
learn how to 
h

mat
osis (O
BE) 
we, as 
self-

awareness, can leave the material body. But you cannot do this 
unless you master the material body and it's Etheric Double. 
During conscious out of the body travel, the Etheric 
Double is still in the material body as it continues to breath and 
the blood circulates. So what are we taking away from our 
material body in Exosomatosis? An elemental that has the image 
of our body we build through the Etheric Double and we are in 
this elemental when we leave the material 
It is in this etheric elemental, which has the image of our 
body, we use to leave our material body. Now here is the 
question: what is the difference between our Etheric Double and 
the etheric essence of the elemental that has the image of our 
material body? You cannot distinguish any difference between 
them either in quality or quantity. However, the etheric elemental 
that has the image of our body is under the control our self­
awareness to the degree of its ability. While the actual Etheric 
Double of the material body that stays in the material body 
remains under the control of the Holy Spirit and Its Archangelic 
emissaries. 
It is important to have killed or at least silenced our egoism 
so that we will not misuse this elemental of ourselves. A master 
can have the Archangels and Holy Spirit to take control of this 
elemental the master makes of themselves.

Please do not get a book about chakras and try to force 
them to open. However, we are allowed to use these centers 
when we are trained and know how to awaken them properly. As 
Researchers of Truth we must first use Introspection to know the 
reality before we ask for the authority to awaken and use these 
powerful centers of energy. 
We will do an exercise using our etheric hand and the end 
of this lesson. What will this kind of training give us?  We can 
extend this etheric hand, feel it, move it and with a dedicated six 
months or so of training, we can even learn to mo,·e an object at a 
distance.

such phenomena for any reason. First of all, they do not really 
convince people because there are so many popular magicians 
who are using stage tricks to imitate true Telekinesis. 
What are we allow to do? To facilitate a healing for people, 
but first we must learn how to use the Etheric Double in this 
regard. So which is better, to use Mind in Telekinesis to move 
inanimate matter, or to use the Mind creatively to relieve the 
suffering in someone's body if it is allowed by God? This is Holy 
work; it is the work the Archangels are doing all the time. With 
training over time a psychotherapist can learn to use this Etheric 
Vitality with real love for their patients and will come in contact 
with the Holy Spirit and the Archangels. When they are sure you 
will make good use of it, the creative ether will be entrusted to 
you. Train in the right way and the author of all Life will reward 
you. 

Questions 
Q. 
Is the 
etheric counterpan 
of material 
body 
the etheric 
b
ody? In 
what is called ethereal 
world? 
A. The etheric counter 
pan of our material body is our 
etheric double it 
is not an independent body. 
If the etheric 
double leaves 
the material 
body the material 
body dies. The 
ethereal 
world is in berween 
the material 
world and the Psychical 
World and in a higher state it is in berween 
the psychical 
and the 
Noetical 
World. 
Q.  Can we use the etheric double to cure ourselves 
and 
how? 
A.  We can if we come to know the nature of the Etheric 
Double 
as Aesthetic 
and Kinetic Ether even without the 
knowledge 
and use of the Creative 
Ether.  A so-called 
Psychical 
Healer learns 
is how to move the Etheric Vitality through his 
han
ds and into 
the body of a patient. 
But he also can 
and should 
im
plant 
a healing 
elemental 
into that patient at the 
same time. 
He 
ca
n 
im
plant 
this with hands on healing as well as 
send a healing 
e
le
m
ent
al to a 
patient anywhere 
in the 
world 
using 
absent 
healing 
m
et
h
o
ds. 
In b
oth 
cases the healing is done 
because it is

psychotherapist learns how to facilitate a cure, he or she then 
becomes a Mental Healer and cures by authority in cooperation 
with the Holy Spirit. 
So the difference between a psychical healer and a mental 
healer is that the mental healer knows how to use the Creative 
Ether. He knows the skill of materialization and 
dematerialization. A psychical healer does not know that and thus 
cannot transmute matter from one state to another. How does a 
mental healer change the nature of matter like this? He does it by 
changiog the nature of the etheric double of that matter. 

Meditation 
This is an exercise, which is also very important for 
practicing psychotherapists and those interested in becoming 
good psychotherapist for healing work. We usually do this with a 
white cloth or anything snow white placed on a table. 
Now, breathe deeply and comfortably as you silence your 
thoughts and emotions. Place your hand on a table, palm down, 
and feel it. Move the physical fingers and see your hand. With 
imprinting ether, see a light in the hand and feel tbat the material 
hand is inside a glove of white light. But also this white light is 
radiation outward from the center of your hand and arm. 
Now gently raise  your  physical hand to your shoulder, 
breathing in on six heartbeats. 1-2-3-4-5-6. now the fingers are on 
the shoulder. Feel them touch the shoulder. Exhale on six 
heart
beats 
and 
leave 
the 
hand 
on 
the 
shoulder.

. 

Do this five times. Now stop, because it is a tiring exercise. 
In the course of time, you will feel the etheric hand and it will 
become a reality for you. 
Again the Etheric Double cannot leave the material body 
or it will die.  So we have the material hand, and we have the 
etheric double. Aren't we using the etheric double of the material 
hand in lifting up the etheric hand? No! The etheric double 
remains in the material hand during this exercise. What we are 
doing is creating an elemental of the hand, and we are in the 
elemental when we raise it. We are not depriving the material 
hand from its etheric double. 
Next time we will talk more about that rate of Mind Vitalit
y 
we call Etheric Vitality and how it functions in the various centers 
or chakras. We will see how these centers serve as passageways or 
gates that connect with the higher bodies through the Etheric 
Doubles. 

Chapter4 
CENTERS 
OF MIND 
VITAL
ITY 
In the 
last lesson 
we spoke about the E
theric Double of 
o
ur m
aterial 
body, 
our psychical 
body and our 
Noetical 
body.  We 
s
aid 
that the 
Etheric Double of our material 
body fu
nctions as a 
m
ould in 
which the material body is built up and 
sustained -
ato
m-b
y-atom, cell-by-cell 
and organ by organ. This 
mould is 
ch
angi
ng over the 
course of time and by this, the whole 
material 
body is changing. 
Coming 
into contact and concentrating 
on the etheric 
double of the material body we discover that its energy, force and 
power constantly come from the ethereal, psychical and Noetical 
World of our planet.  As we said these are   all connected. Further 
study 
reveals that both 
our psychical 
body and our Noetical body 
each 
have their 
own etheric 
double.  So the etheric doubles 
of all 
three 
bodies are the 
connecting 
link between these 
bodies.  It is 
imp
ortant that 
we learn how to keep that link 
consciously. 
This 
p
ro
mot
es 
good health in all three bodies and 
facilitates our 
sp
iritual unfoldm
ent. 
Ne
xt 
we 
have to learn about the centers 
of energy 
on and 
i
n 
t
h
e 
eth
e
ric 
doub
le.  In the East they call 
these 
centers 
Chakras. 
Th
e 
w
or
d 
C
hakra is 
from the 
ancient 
Sanskrit 
mea
ning 
wheel 
or 

turning. That is an apt description of the look and working of 
centers of energ
y 
in the etheric double of the material body. 
In the etheric double of the material body, they are disks 
that rotate and concur with certain areas and organs in  our body. 
The disks are really funnel-shaped and opening up like flowers on 
the surface of the etheric double. They serve to funnel energy 
from the etheric double into these organs looking something like 
the whirlpool created in a bathtub as the water circles and goes 
down the drain. 
Now it is very unwise to get a book about the Chakras 
from the eastern systems and start experimenting without training. 
Reading those books you get the impression that these chakras are 
on  the material body. They are not, they are on and in the etheric 
double. But they do influence the material body. Improper 
concentration on these can cause damages to the corresponding 
organs in the material body. However, we can and should study 
them, come to know them, use them with respect and with care. 
Mystics from past ages have known about the etheric disks 
and consider them sacred. They have known something about 
these different points of energy on the etheric double, which 
perform 
certain 
functions according to their nature and locati
on. 
The 
entire 
etheric 
double 
is like 
a sponge, 
soaking 
up th
e 
etheric 
vitality 
all around 
us and 
giving 
it to the 
materi
al body.

It i

the minor

at the

The 
most

in our

are all under 
the contro

and 
s
upervi
s
ion 
of the  Holy  Spirit 
and it
s 
Archangelic 
emi

arie
s
.  When 
we 
s
tan 
to engage 
our self with 
the work 
on the etheric 
do
u
ble, we 
s
tan by 
concentrating 
on every 
pan 
of the surface 
of the materia
l 
body. 
We think 
we are feeling 
and concentrating 
on the materia
l 
body. 
But it is really the etheric 
double 
of the material 
body 
we are 
feeling. 
It is dangerous 
to concentrate 
direct
l
y on the bean 
o
r 
genitals. 
A lot of people, 
both 
men and women, 
mi
s

organ 
of the genitals 
and that cau

If we concentrate in the solar plexus what does that do? It 
opens the gates to your sub-consciousness. This is well known. 
It opens the gates of your sub-consciousness to the psychical 
planes. This is a benefit if you have already cleaned up the 
emotions and desires of your personality. But what if you open 
this gate if you have not cleaned up resentful, fearful, jealous, and 
other unclean emotions? What will happen? You can find 
yourself in a hell and see things happening that can greatly disrurb 
and unsettle you for days. So it is ill advised to open this gate 
before having mastery over the emotions and desires of your 
personality. 
Our approach is careful and in reverence for these Holy 
centers of vitality. Because the Holy Spirit manifests Itself in your 
material body and supervises the amazing work of these centers. 
The exercises we teach allow us to use the kinetic and aesthetic 
ethers to move and touch these centers. Then using the 
imprinting ether we use various colors that beneficially affect the 
etheric centers and  our etheric double. 
These centers of accumulated vitality are positioned at 
various points in the etheric double, the centers on the central 
column interests us the most. The function of these major 
centers is to maintain balance and flow of etheric vitality

body. 
Each cent

its 
magn

flow of etheric 
subst
ance 
through it. 
The 
first 
center that we mention 
is the last 
center a mystic 
a
tte
m
pts to 
awaken. 
It is the center of the Sacrum. 
In the 
e
ast 
th
is  is 
the 
l
ocation 
of the so-called Kundalini 
serpent fire. 
It is 
l
oca
ted 
at the base of 
the spinal co
l
umn.  Its 
creative fire 
rotares 
aro
un
d the tailbone 
in seven spira
l
s resembling 
a 
snake.  It is not a 
snak
e but this 
turrung, 
ribbon like light gives the impression 
of a 
dar
ting 
snake.  It has been depicted 
and described 
in this way 
espe
cia
ll
y in 
the east.  Pan of is luminosity 
energizes 
the organs in 
the material body through the creative ether.  The Holy Spirit and 
the Archangel Michael are in control of this powerful center of 
energy, which is depicted by the dark red color of fire and heat. 
In 
the Bible, Archangel Michael is described as having a "whirling 
fiery 
double edge sword". 
This is a symbolic 
refer
e
nce to 
this 
sacr
ed fire 
in center number 
ten, which is under 
his 
control and 
not the personality. 
T
he 
next one 
concerrung 
us is center 
number nine as 
d
ep
ict
ed 
on 
the 
Symbol of Life. The disk is 
located 
o
n 
the solar 
p

but 
its 
peri

with three

the liver 
(center

three 
centers the

representing our material existence. As we said, the center of the 
solar plexus is a portal leading to the lower planes of the Psychical 
World. Conscious work on the centers over the liver and spleen, 
gives a preliminary stage of intuition. It gives us a deeper level of 
perception of other  people's  thoughts and emotions. 
Next we come to center number six, the heart center, 
which is located slightly above the physical heart. Of course the 
physical heart is pumping blood through your body. But at 
another level the heart is a pump that is pumping etheric vitality 
through your material body distributing the pulse of life to every 
material organ, cell and atom. 
The heart is a center of self-awareness of the personality. 
This center of self-awareness is not in the material heart, it is in 
the psycho-Noetical counter part of the material  heart. Here you 
can come in contact with the Permanent  Personality your Inner 
Self. 
Our material heart beating in our chest is an organ through 
which we can hear the Holy Spirit and the Archangels talk to us. 
Every beat of the material heart is their love for us to sustain our 
material life. Every beat is their voice saying, "I love you". The 
heart 
of the 
personality, not the material heart is the energy 
cen
ter 
of our emotions. Now  what happens when you are out of the 
body during Exosomatosis or in sleep, where is your psycho-
82 

N
o
etic
al heart 
then? 
You carry it with you 
into the 
psycho­
Noetical World. 
Myst
ically our heart 
is our sancrum
, and the Holy 
of 
H
olli
es. 
In the Holy 
of Holies 
we worship 
God the 
Everlas
ting 
Lif
e.  B
ut the 
word 
worship 
means 
to approach 
not just praise. 
We 
can 
make our heart 
our sancrum 
where 
we contact 
God.  But 
first 
we have to clean it and make 
i
t free of such 
things as 
jeal
ousy, negativity 
and hostility. 
Concentrate 
not the 
heart organ 
pum
ping blood 
but on your Holy of Holies. 
You must clean 
all 
desires,  all emotions and their home, which is your sub­
consciousness. When you concentrate on your heart you 
concentrate on your selfhood. Here is your real church that you 
must enter and make ready. So that every time you need to 
connect  with God and receive guidance, inspiration and 
realiz
ation, 
you can enter there and have genuine 
communio

It is necessary for us to use the mind in order to control the 
conflicting vibrations racing through your heart. However, we 
should never be cruel to our heart. Yet we must use Noetical 
reason to control the psychical vibrations of the heart. 
Daskalos was giving this lesson once in Cyprus and a lady 
complained about controlling the heart with the mind saying she 
thought the best way in life was to follow your heart. Daskalos 
assured her that if she controlled her heart with her mind, her 
heart would be the first to thank her for setting it free from 
mistakes and weaknesses. 
So everyone must clean their heart because it is not with 
your material eyes you will see God. You will not even see God 
with your mind but with your heart. Christ came to show us the 
way and teach us that. He said, "Blessed are the pure in heart for 
they shall see God". God is Love, pure impersonal Love and he 
gives his Love for all and to all. 
The last of the prime etheric centers is in the head. 
Actually these are in reality two points in the head center, two 
tangential centers, which means they radiate out in different 
directions from the same source, the cerebellum. Residing in 
betwee
n the lobes 
of the brain, one radiates and opens on 
top 
of 
the head 
and the other one radiates and opens at the root 
of 
the 
nose between the eyes. 
84 

The 
one 
over 
the head 
is generally 
known 
as the crown 
c
h
akr
a 
and 
the one 
in 
front 
of the head 
is 
called 
the 
third 
eye 
ch
ak
ra. 
Whe
n the 
one 
over 
the head 
opens 
it gives 
us conscious 
Ex
oso
mato
sis. 
When 
the second 
one opens 
it 
gives 
us 
conscio
us 
clai

yanc
e. 
Never 
concentrate 
intensely 
in the head 
on the material 
brains 
as this  cannot 
only 
cause 
a severe 
headache 
but can do 
injury. 
We can 
concentrate 
on and 
around 
the whole 
area 
of the 
head, 
but we do it without 
any tension. 
Tension 
is burning the 
Etheric 
Vitality. 
We just 
calmly and 
gently 
put our attention 
in 
the head 
area. 
Concentration 
means 
feeling 
with 
attention 
but 
without 
any 
tension. 
It is also 
safe 
to concentrate 
in the etheric 
double 
of the 
head 
just 
some 
distance 
out of the head 
at the location 
of the root 
of the nose. 
This 
is  our 
so-called 
third 
eye. 
But never 
concentrate 
on the material 
eyes 
and 
never 
strongly 
focus 
on your 
own 
eyes 
as you 
look 
into 
a mirror 
to develop 
clain·oyance. 
Instead  close  your 
eyes 
and 
concentrate 
in your 
etheric 
double 
about 
three  or 
four 
inches 
out from 
the root 
of your 
nose 
and in 
ti
me you  may  start 
developing 
clairvoyance. 
Clairvoyance 
is from 
t
he French language 
and 
means 
seeing 
clearly.

only about seven heavens because that is as far as the human 
intelligence can reach. Even a person, who has raised his 
consciousness high enough to reach the seventh heaven, can say 
very little about it in any language. 
So we know of seven heavens and microcosmicall
y 
these 
represent the seven main etheric centers. In Revelations, Saint 
John the Divine, makes mention of seven churches using the 
word Ekklesia (s><><AYJ<Jisc;) In his Greek language the word means 
a gathering place and was a reference to the seven etheric centers 
in the etheric double of our material body in which elementals 
gather and collect. The elementals gather in the seven churches 
or seven centers and we must keep that congregation clean. 
Saint John further speaks of the seven candlesticks or 
lamps. These are a reference to the seven centers in the etheric 
double of the psychical body. John mentions the seven stars, 
which are a reference to the seven centers of vitality in the etheric 
double of our Noetical body. These centers in the etheric double 
of the Noetical body are brighter  than in the etheric  doubles of 
the psychical and material body. 
At 
the beginning we use disks of light moving them aro
und 
and 
passing them 
through the centers in the etheric double 
of 
the 
material body. 
Later we will use fourth and fifth 
dimension

centers in 
the etheric 
do

and Noetical 
bo

How 
do we 
do this work 
with the disks and 
spheres? 
It is 
b
y 
c
rea
ting an 
elemen
tal in our etheric 
double of 
a disk or 
sphere 
an
d 
moving in 
and on that elemental. 
Now in 
creating 
a
n 
elem
ental in the etheric double of our 
material 
body 
in
stan
taneously 
imprints 
on the etheric double of 
our psychical 
and 
N
oetical bodies. 
But it needs good skills 
ofvisu
a
lization, 
whi
ch 
means we must learn the ability of using the imprinting 
ether.  T
his requires 
practicing 
the exercises 
sincerely 
to develop 
this skill.  When we start working with the etheric double of the 
material body, we start to not only realize it really exists, but that 
we may use it.  We may use it like any other part of our body; it is 
ours in the same way our body is ours to use. 
Once 
you get to 
know it and start using it, 
n
o one 
c
an tell 
you 
it does 
not exist.  By using it you know it and are 
sure that it 
ex
ists. 
Are 
we granted 
powers when we lear
n 
how 
to use it? 
No! 
We 
alr
eady 
have these 
so-called 
powers late

us as our 
own

we just

the ability to get the vibrations from an ob

ether
, 
learn everything about that ob
j
ect and discover where it 
came from and what happened to it over the course of time. 
People tend to call them psychical powers but they are not 
the psychical powers, these are abilities made possible by the 
etheric double of the material body. We gain access to them 
when we learn to control our etheric double. 
All that sound very exciting but are there practical uses for 
these abilities? Yes especially for the psychotherapist. 
J
ust 
concentrating in the etheric double and using visualization you 
can coordinate with any part of the etheric double of a material 
body and remove pain and restore health. You can do this in 
your body or someone else's, provided the Holy Spirit permits 
this. Which means that provided that person is not under some 
karmic debt, which he has to pay. We have to pay our negative 
karmic debts not as punishments for bad actions but as an 
important lesson in our development. 
As a psychotherapist you will see that sometimes when you 
send the etheric vitality and visualize properly, there are still 
obstacles. Your efforts do not always work. So we make this 
effort again. We try up to three times, and if it does not work 
then 
stop 
for now. 
Do not continue 
and 
try to force 
it. 
Don'
t

Spirit.

all the centers 
become 
more

in

th
e 
Holy 
Spirit

Yes! We have

that the

intelligence 
which 
continually 
builds 
and 
sus
tains 
the material  body 
from 
the center 
of each

The Holy 
Spirit 
is not a personality 
but absolute 
su
per-consciousn
ess, which is 
very different 
from 
Self-Awareness 
but it still, knows
. 
The Holy Spirit according to the Divine plan has created 
the  eyes we see with,  the ears we hear with and the brain we 
perceive with. So  if it gives us these to make us  aware, then  of 
cou
rse it is  fully 
aware 
of  what 
is going 
on  with  us. 
It is aware  of 
our 
strug
g
le and helps 
us with  our effort 
to unfold 
spirituall
y and 
wake 
up
. 
Th
e

perishable bodies in the three worlds of separateness, we are not 
really away from God. We are always live by right within Its 
multiplicity. 
Back to the etheric doubles and centers, which we 
must 
learn how to use consciousl
y
, to move these centers and be able 
to clean them all.  This gives a feeling of satisfaction as we start to 
live happier, healthier and feel stronger. You start to realize who 
you are and your life takes on a deeper meaning. So in using 
matter and etheric substance in a correct way, we bring down our 
psychological prisons and build up paradises here and in the 
worlds beyond. 
Now the disks are not moving the same way in all people. 
The typical movement of the disks is clockwise. We see their 
movement clockwise. It is as if we were outside of our body 
looking back at ourselves holding a clock. This means the 
rotation of the disks is from the lower right part of our body, up 
to the upper right, to the top, then down to the lower left and 
back to the bottom again. We use the kinetic ether to make this 
rotation and then the imprinting ether to mentally see color light 
to energize the rotating disc. 
Various colors are in and on the etheric double 
but whit
e 
is 
the 
dominant  color. The so-called human aura is really 
just 
lig
ht 
emanating from the etheric double of the material body. This

The 
etheri
c aura 
radiates 
a white 
color 
but 
it  is  not

The 
etheric 
double 
itself 
has 
the 
shape of 
your 
material 
body 
and 
is within 
and 
slightly 
around 
your 
material 
body. 
Its 
ether 
is denser 
than 
the 
etheric 
radiation 
of the 
aura. 
The 
etheric 
do
uble 
has  different 
colors 
and 
shades 
according 
to 
a person's 
psycho-Noetical 
composition. 
This 
means 
according 
to  the 
emotions 
and 
thoughts 
a person 
harbours 
and 
expresses. 
The 
colors 
reveal 
the 
nature 
of 
emotional 
thought 
conditions. 

Questions 
Q.  Can you discuss what Daskalos meant by 
thought 
desires as opposed to desire thoughts? 
A.  Every thought, feeling and behavior creates an 
elemental. Daskalos classified the elementals in two prime classes. 
They are Thought-Desire elementals and the Desire-Thou
ght 
elemental. We can never have a thought without some emotion 
or desire in it.  Likewise we never can have a feeling or desire 
without some thought associated with it.  Thought and 
Desire/Emotion are joined. The Desire-Thought type elementals 
are far more common and make up about 80% of all elementals. 
These unclean spirits are the kind that Christ called "mute and 
meaningless". Desire-Thought elementals lead us astray. 
Thought-Desire elementals are much more powerful than 
Desire-Thought elementals. These have been created with more 
logical thought. In these kinds of elementals the desire serves the 
thought, it empowers the thought and the elemental tends to fulftl 
its purpose quicker. With the Desire-Thought type elementals, 
the thought becomes enslaved to the desire and this is not good. 
Thought should be the master of desire and not its servant. 
With Desire-Thought 
elementals 
when 
we desire 
something 
and want to possess 
it, we immediately 
start thin
king 
how to get the object 
of our desire. 
M
a
j'
be 
you think 
about it 
and 
92 

d
ec
id
e  to get 
a second 
job or a loan 
in 
orde
r to 
buy 
the obje
ct of 
y
o
ur 
de
sire. 
Or if you 
are not an honest 
person 
you 
may 
even 
s
tar
t 
to 
think 
how 
you 
can 
steal 
that 
object 
of 
your 
desire 
and 
p
o
ss
ess 
it. 
Now 
both 
types 
of elementals 
are empower
ed by 
Etheric 
Vi
tali
ty 
whic
h we 
give  the elemental 
by the intensity 
of our focus 
on 
it 
and 
the 
number of 
times 
we  repeat 
it and 
revital
ize the 
elemental. 
Q.  How does one master emotions "'ithout storing and 
energizing elementals? 
A. Emotions and desire are mastered by thought. We use 
our Noetical body, our mind body, to master our  psychical or 
emotional body. This is the  proper way. But  here we are not 
creating the deaf dumb spirits, the Desire Thought type which do 
not serve us. Now we are creating good well thought out ally t
y
pe 
elementals that serve us and not our lower emotions and desires. 

Mediation 
Get 
in a comfortable 
position 
and 
relax 
your 
mat
erial 
b
od
y. 
Feel 
your 
whole 
material 
body 
while 
relaxing  comfortably. 
Feel 
your 
material 
body 
means 
that 
you 
are coordinated 
with 
the 
aesthetic ether, 
one 
of the qualities 
of the etheric 
double. 
In this 
way 
your 
etheric double 
and 
body 
will 
be calm. 
Now 
feel yourself 
in the aesthetic 
ether 
of your 
body. 
But 
do not use the bnetic 
ether 
at the moment. 
Feel 
yourself 
in the 
whole 
etheric 
double 
of your 
body 
and stay 
there. 
Now 
start 
to 
breathe 
rhythmically 
and 
consciously. 
Through 
your 
will 
power, 
through 
the aesthetic 
and 
kinetic 
ether, 
you 
can 
feel 
more 
intensively 
in your abdominal area. 
Concentrate 
and 
feel 
in the abdominal 
area. 
In this 
way 
you work 
with 
the aesthetic 
ether. 
Through 
breathing, 
you 
concentrate 
more 
etheric 
vitality 
in this 
area. 
Breathe 
and 
concentrate 
deeper 
on the aesthetic 
ether. 
Feel 
it more 
and 
more. 
Now 
see through 
visualisation 
a sky-blue  colour 
disk 
about 
two 
feet 
in diameter 
inside 
and 
outside 
of your 
abdominal 
area. 
It 
is radiating 
brilliant 
sky blue 
light. 
Next 
we start 
to rotate 
clockwise 
on the periphery 
of the disc 
that 
is in the abdominal 
area. 
We just want 
movement 
on the rim 
of this 
disk 
only. 
The 
disc 
itself 
is immovable 
at the moment.

to over the spleen and back to the

N
ow you know a form 
of aesthetic and kinetic ether in the 
ab
do
minal area.  You are moving on the rim of this disc 
using 
o
nly 
your will power. 
This is Will-i\fovement. 
Contemplate 
this 
Will-
Movement 
within the etheric double on the rim of this 
beau
tiful sky-blue clisk. 
Now say silently: 
"I want perfect heath 
in my material 
body". 
Take a deep breath and enter in your chest.  Now see 
through 
visualisation 
a rosy white colour clisk 
about two feet in 
cliameter 
inside and outside of your chest area. 
The center of this 
disc in your chest is the etheric heart.  It is radiating misty rosy 
white light.  This 
clisc rouches the shoulders, passes through 
the 
thyroid and the armpits downwards 
to the sternum. 
Is this disk 
on  the surface of the chest or in the chest?  The disc before was 
within the abdominal 
area.  Now rnu feel you are 
on 
the surface 
of the chest. 
Visualise 
and see a rosy disc and rotate clockwise 
on 
the periphery 
of the clisc in the same way as before by using onh· 
your will power.  It is as if this rosy clisc is 
on 
your chest.  Now 
s
ay silently: 
"I want 
perfect 
heath 
in 
my emotional body" 
We 
95 

must practice this exercise repeatedly to become master of these 
two investigations. 
Have you ever thought about thought itself? Next time we 
will. 
We will examine  deeply  what thought really is where  it 
comes 
from and who the thinker  behind the thought is. 

Chapter 5 
THOUGHT 
If we research to see the spiritual teachings of the ancients, 
we find that the Eg
y
ptians, Hindus, Greeks and others were 
concealing their spiritual truth in mythological tales.  But we can 
also see this in Christian literature too. Take for example, the 
story of Saint George and the Dragon. Clearly real dragons did 
not exist on earth during and after the time of Christ; so this 
Christian story is a metaphor too.  However, Saint George really 
existed but dragons did not. 
This account is a metaphor for the central task facing any 
spiritual seeker - the killing of their egoism. The imagery of this 
teaching is Saint George riding a white horse killing a dragon that 
is holding a woman hostage next to a body of water.  Saint 
George kills this dragon using a spear. 
This 
and other 
legends 
have different 
versio

levels of

body

cleaned

So it is right 
thought 
that 
sav
es the 
day. 
But what is thought? 
Thought is a mental concentration to gain knowledge. 
Thought is the movement of:\loetical substance towards a 
subject and returns vibrations of the illind to giYe us information 
and knowledge about the observed subject. 
Thought is the formulation of the :\!ind super substance by 
an  entity. That means, as an in,fa�dual self-awareness take the 
formless super substance of the i\lind and formulate it into 
specific thoughts. In  other words we giYe this formless super 
substance form and definition. 
We do that mostly subconsciously, not really 
understanding what we are doing. But when we do this 
consciously whatever thought we formulate is much more 
p
owerful and effective. 
So 
as an 
enti
ty 
we formulate 
a thought 
for meaning, 
for the 
p
erc
eption 
of ideas 
and

second way we use the iVlind is done by the inner self; the results 
of which are enjoyed by the present-day personaliry. 
In our system we practice thought Meditation, which is the 
successive formulation of interrelated thoughts that leads to 
knowledge of a subject. This is the right kind of Meditation that 
leads to something meaningful. With this kind of mediation, 
knowledge is gained by our personality. Through this kind of 
Meditation a series of related Noetical images get implanted into 
our sub-conscious mind. From which point, the personaliry can 
recall these picture-images to the conscious part of their mind and 
relive the Meditation experience. 
This is what we are doing with the Meditations on the 
labors of Hercules. The Meditational scenes form Noetical 
images, which gets stored in our sub consciousness, along with 
the meaning. Then can be recalled when needed. They can also 
automatically come to mind when we facing challenges in life. 
For example the Hydra of desire  labor we spoke about 
before. After doing this labor many times it becomes a living 
elemental residing in our sub-conscious mind. Then when we are 
influenced by our own desires, the elemental of this labor, with its 
full meaning, will come to our conscious mind. This is an ally 
type 
elemental we create consciously and it comes to our 
aid wh
en 
we  feel the pressure of our unbridled desires. 
100 

N
ow 
we 
should ask, 
what is the difference 
between desire 
a
n
d 
tho
ught? 
Both are 
Mind but in two 
different 
states, 
in rwo 
d
iff
ere
nt frequ
encies of vibration. 
Srudiing 
the effec
ts of desire 
an
d 
thoug
ht in us what do we always find? 
We find 
all throug
h 
o
ur 
life we 
have been ensla,ing 
the higher 
vibrations of 
Mind to 
low
er 
\ibrations of Mind.  In other words, we 
are enslav
ing our 
thought _into the senice of our desires. 
So what should we do?  A realistic approach is to study our 
desires instead of blindly following them.  Leaming the narure of 
our desires and subordinating them to reasonable thought frees 
our personality. Because we find out that all these states of 
consciousness that we call unhealthy desire and passions lead to 
weakness and gives pain and sorrow to our personality. 
Maybe to the personality it does not sound so appealing to 
subordinate its desire to reasonable thought. But what will be the 
very first result of this kind of sensible thought? The purificarion 
of the heart! 
We 
have to 
study thought to find out just where 
we are 
dr
a
wing 
the po
wer 
necessary to form i
mages.  This 
creation 
of 
No
eti
cal 
ima
ges 
we are calling visualizatio
n. 
We 
mistakenly 
think 
t
h
at t
he
se im
ages are 
abstract and not concr
ete. 
But 
one da
y 
we 
wi
ll 
fi
nd 
that 
Noe
tical 
images are more real 
and 
durable than 
an
y 
101 

material 
object. 
A lot of contemplation 
and 
Meditation 
is 
required 
to really 
understand 
what 
thought 
is. 
Most 
believe 
they 
know 
what 
thought 
is. 
But 
once 
you 
deeply 
study 
this 
subject, 
what 
you 
know 
now 
of thought 
will 
seem 
weak 
and 
incomplete. 
What 
do you 
think 
thought 
really 
is? 
Do you 
think? 
Yes 
of course 
you 
think. 
But 
how 
are you 
thinking: 
Self­
consciously, 
consciously 
or in a sub 
conscious  habitual  way? 
As 
you 
will learn, 
sub conscious, 
mechanical  thinking 
does 
not serve 
us very 
much. 
So what 
is thought? 
Thought 
is a form. 
Thinking 
is a way 
to obtain 
an already 
existing 
condition 
from 
the Mind. 
So by 
thinking 
we reach 
and 
give 
this existing 
condition 
a form and 
we 
bring 
it as an image 
into 
our inner 
Noetical 
(mental) 
world. 
\X'e 
also 
project 
it into 
the Noetical 
world 
of our outer 
environment 
as 
a living 
elem 
en ta!. 
Up to this 
point 
in time, 
most 
of mankind 
has only 
learned 
to create 
these 
images 
mechanically 
or sub 
consciously. 
These 
images 
are simply 
the outcome 
of mankind's 
desire, 
motivations 
and 
intentions 
found 
in his or her em�ronment. 
Really 
people 
have 
not researched 
what 
thought 
really 
is 
or 
what 
causes  thought? 
Who 
is it that 
is actually 
doing 
the 
102 

th
i
nk
ing? 
What is 
the aim of the thought? 
What results 
from the 
eff
ort of thinking? 
First 
of all 
no one has ever thoug
ht of 
anythin
g 
that they 
h
a
ve 
not 
already 
noticed. 
People 
do not haYe 
thoughts 
about 
so
m
ething that 
has not already 
come 
to their 
attentio
n.  This 
is 
n
ot 
beca
use it  is 
impossible. 
It  is because 
people 
are  not 
used 
to 
doing that. 
Many 
mistakenly 
believe 
that ll,find 
is thought. 
It is 
not. 
Thoug
ht is a product 
of the Mind. 
If we think of the ll,lind 
as 
water, 
then thoughts 
are like pieces 
of ice.  Ice is also water but in 
a 
condensed 
state, 
in a lower 
rate of ,�bration. 
From this 
simplistic 
example 
we can now see the difference 
between 
the 
nature 
and the existence. 
We see the difference 
between 
the 
nature 
of ll,iind 
and its existence 
as a thought. 
So 
what is our relation 
to the ll,iind and thought? 
Are 
we 
the 
ll,iind?  No, 
we use  the 
ll,find 
to formulate 
thought. 
But we 
are 
not 
the  thoughts 
or the emotions 
we 
formula
te from 
the 
Min
d.  At 
this 
time  on 
earth 
a personalit
y needs 
the material 
brain 
to 
pr
oduce thought. 
Because 
Human 
Beings 
at 
this 
point in 
time 
te
n
d 
to 
live 
mostly 
sub consciously. 
In 
other 
words, 
they are 
c
u
r
re
n
tly 
under 
the do
main of the human 
brain. 
But as we 
teach 
a
n
d 
de
m
onstr
ate it is 
possible 
for us to 
use the 11,lin
d 
directly. 
The 
m
at
er
ial 
bra
in is 
nece
ssary for the expre
ssion 
of our 
human 
103 

nature, our earthly personality.  But the material brain is not 
needed for the expression of our Divine Nature as a god. 
With practice a Researcher of Truth advances and learns to 
make 
use of the Mind independently of the material brain. A
n 
ordinary 
person will not know how to do this. This method of 
using 
the Mind is better and the resultant thought is now a great 
power. We call this kind of thought "Creative Thought" 
But to have either ordinary thought or Creative Thought, 
we must have self-awareness behind it.  The self-awareness, at 
any level of expression, is the thinker behind the thought. But at 
this point in evolution, the thinker has not made it to the 
perfection of the father. Christ advocated this saying: "Be yea 
perfect as perfect as your heavenly father". 
The thinker is perfect when he can express the Mind as real 
Will Power. The outcome of this is materialization as an 
accomplishment of the thinker. But before reaching that state, 
the thinker projects his thoughts as a power-forms or elementals 
without realizing it.  These kinds of sub conscious thought 
projections Christ called: "Spirits mute and meaningless". This 
means that they do not have wisdom and are just time and place 
expressions without meaningful content. 
104 

C
learly 
this is 
not the real purpose 
of 
forming 
Mind into 
t
h
ou
ghts. 
With 
practic
e, over 
time, 
we will 
learn 
how to 
use the 
Mi
nd 
as 
thou
ght-p
owers, 
creative 
elemental
s 
endow
ed with 
life! 
Ask 
yours
elf again 
- what 
is thought
? 
Thoug
ht is 
m
ov

ent in time, 
because 
you cannot 
hav
e 
or 
u
n

stan
d

without 
movement 
over 
a period 
of time. 
To create a 
th
ough
t there 
is a drawing 
of the super 
substan
ce of 
Jl.,Iind 
from 
our sub consciousness 
where 
it already 
exists. 
When 
we concentrate 
and meditate 
we form 
the Jl.,Iind 
into 
something 
specific 
of our own. 
Not a single 
human 
thought 
can 
exist unless 
it is associated 
with 
at least 
some 
emotion. 
Likewise 
we cannot have 
any emotion 
without 
a least 
some 
thought 
associated 
with 
it. 
We said 
before 
that thought, 
is a means to gain 
knowledge. 
To gain  knowledge 
we must 
enter 
through 
the idea and into the 
meani
ng of the thought. 
Thought 
as radiance 
begins 
in the 
N 
aerie 
World 
and 
descends 
to the lower 
worlds. 
The shado
w 
of 
th
ou
ght is its 
specifi
c fo
rm
.  This 
shadow 
is 
formed 
in the 
lower 
wo
rld
s of 
thoug
ht not at 
the highest. 
That 
means 
a 
Noetic 
t
hou
ght 
gets 
its fo
rm 
in the Noetical 
\X'orld 
and even 
in the 
Ps
y
chi
cal 
World. 
But for a form 
to 
exist 
in 
the 
Psyc
hical 
W
orld,

t
h
o
u
g
ht 
t
hat 
comes 
from 
the Noeti
cal 
Worl
d.  If this 
did not 
105 

happen 
in both 
the psychical 
and material 
world 
both 
worlds 
would 
be devoid 
of forms. 
All the life forms 
around 
us in the 
natural 
world 
are projections 
of Di,·ine 
thought 
endowed 
with 
life. 
Now 
we ask - what 
is the cause 
of thought? 
The 
beginning 
of thought 
starts 
as we become 
aware 
of conditions, 
or 
an object. 
If there 
is no interest 
generated 
by that object, 
no 
thought 
will occur. 
This is saying  that 
interest 
is a prerequisite 
of 
thinking.  Thinking 
means 
we are creating 
Noetical 
images 
within 
our Noetical 
body. 
But what 
if the thought 
we create 
is trivial 
and something 
not so valuable 
to us at the moment? 
So we forget 
about 
it.  But 
does 
forgetting 
mean 
that the trivial 
thought 
is dissolved 
and lost? 
No
l 
J\ll thoughts 
remembered 
or not become 
part of our 
personality's 
sub consciousness. 
These 
can be retrieved 
and 
brought 
back 
to the surface 
of memory. 
They 
come 
forward 
as 
Noetical 
images, 
which 
bring 
with them 
the vibrations 
associated 
with the original 
thought. 
These 
resonate 
in our personality. 
It may be a positive 
or 
negative 
resonation 
of varying 
strength. 
The thought 
creates 
a 
vibration 
in us, which 
means 
it creates 
a condition, 
which 
we 
ca
ll 
desire, 
feeling, 
and emotion. 
106 

Now here is another good question: "What is the 
relationship between thought and feeling"? To know this we 
need to separate these two conditions. These are two different 
conditions but both are made from the same super substance of 
the Mind. For its continued life, a thought-form or elemental 
needs a consistent power, which means it must have some feeling 
and desire in it. 
Now why do we call the projected thought forms, 
elementals? We call them elementals because they are composed 
of different mixtures of Noetical, psychical and ethereal elements. 
Now let's create a thought. Say we see a tree.  When you 
say, "I see a tree", it means that you perceive it and have become 
aware of its existence outside of you.  We see it because of the 
visible light, which is a range of etheric vibration that is 
perceptible to our  eye. Any etheric vibrations that are higher or 
lower than the range perceivable by our eye  is what we 
cal
l .
.. 
darkness. 
When 
light 
falls on the surface 
of tree, for example, 
it 
i
mp
rint
s the 
light 
with the form, color and 
t
e
xture 
of the 
tree. 
Th
at 
im
printe
d light 
brings 
the image of the 
tree to our 
e
y
e 
and 
We 
sa
y: "
we see the 
tree". 
Remem
ber th
e 
imp
rinting 
nature 
of 
e
it
h
er 
is 
one of its prime chara
cter
isti
cs. 
107 

Now 
when we see that tree we   may become interested and 
want to know more about it.  That interest is wrapped around a 
thought and in a sub conscious way leads to other thoughts and 
vibrations 
in our psychical body. So in order to know that tree or 
anythin
g
, we concentrate on it and that initiates thou
g
ht. 
Now let's go deeper. When we see that tree, the light 
reflecting from it contains a complete and whole image of that 
tree. That image enters the eyeball, strikes the optic nerve and 
gets converted into minute electrical impulses that register on the 
visual cortex in the brain as si
g
ht. 
But think about this. The image of the tree transferred to 
the optic nerve is imprinted on the light. So light is the carrier of 
the image. But there is no visible light travelling in the optic nerve 
or in brain and yet still say we "see". \Ve can see the tree, the li
g
ht 
of the environment and other objects in the scene  with a full 
sense of depth perception. How does that happen without visible 
light? Really sight is a wondrous work being done in the brain on 
the behalf of the personality self-awareness. 
So now we concentrate on the tree and a succession of 
thoughts begin. But in reality are we concentrating on the real 
outer tree or the image of the tree in our brain? What could it 
be? Are we studying the vibration, the stimulus on the optic 
108 

n
erv
e 
that 
gave 
rise 
to the 
image 
in 
our 
brai
n? 
Or 
are w
e 
i
n
v
es
tiga
ting 
the 
real 
tree 
existing 
in the 
outer 
envir
onm
ent? 
W
ith
out 
und
ersta
nding 
it we are 
doing 
both. 
Because 
there 
is 
an 
ext
ensio
n 
of us in the 
ether 
of the 
envir
onmen
t to 
th
e 
tr
e
e, 
si
m
ulta
neous
ly we 
also 
inves
t
igate 
the 
image 
as 
well 
as 
the 
vib
ration 
of the 
tree. 
So we will 
study 
the 
image 
but 
also 
we   can 
feel and know something about the tree itself. 
With development over time, a deep researcher will learn 
how to project thought inside the tree itself. Then we can learn 
more in an instant than what a physical scientist could in a lifetime 
of study. This  is  done  through the higher powers of Attunement 
and At-One-Ment. Through Atrunement we will discover that 
the Mind super substance has many more qualities than we 
understand or  use now. We see  that thought is something much 
more superior that what we think it is now. 
Ok 
so we 
have 
said 
something 
about 
how 
thoug
h
t 
o
ccurs, 
a
nd 
we 
know 
that 
we are

light.  This stud,· will re,·eal in time a fuller understanding of our 
Self. 
�
o
w we start to disengage 
our sense of self from the 
limited 
personality 
with its strengths 
and weaknesses. 
That 
inadequate 
understanding 
will be replaced 
by the direct experience 
that we  are something 
truly great - the incorruptible 
Soul. 
As beings we will stop using the mind sub consciously and 
start using the Mind at will consciously. Mind is a N  oetic, 
�oetical and Ps,·chical mirror in on which we can concentrate in 
order to know things; including our own Self. 
As we said before, we draw from the super substance of 
:\find to form a thought. In this state Mind is hard to define 
before the formation of a thought. However, without the 
fnrmation of thought we can enter a state where we receive no 
impressions. 
This state is the state we all spend a few hours in each night 
in deep dreamless sleep. But the moment we come out of 
dreamless sleep we immediate!� start to form thoughts and pull 
up image5 stored in our sub conscious mind. 
Deep dreamless sleep is like a Yoid where no impressio
ns 
reach our personalit\". But upon waking we again start recei,;ng 
these impression and the memories from the past.  Thus rhe 
continuity of our personality is preserved. Nothing is loss. 
1111 

Ev

our 
personality 
is still

a few hours 
in

we awaken

what are we as self-aw

there is a state we can enter in 
deep 
:\Iedit

nothing 
from the outside 
world is received, 
no 
impress

In this state we do not express 
ourseh•es 
outwardly and yet we are whole and complete.  \
Y
hat are we then? 
\'<:ben you reach that state and experience it directly you 
understand you are a deathless Spirit, an Eremal Di,ine Being 
beyond 
mortality. 
This experience 
and repeated 
experiences 
of

travel prm·e to us unequi,·ocally 
that death 
does not

this may seem 
difficult 
to understand 
now, but once 
you 
ha,·e the direct experience, it will be so ob,ious. 
So 
we will look into to all this -
again 
by 
using 
the

to un

more about the object than before, because before we were not so 
interested in it or focused on it. The keyword here is focused: to 
be focused on something. So the prerequisite for gaining 
knowledge about anything is to be focused. 
When we investigate anything we are always using the 
same 
Super-Substance of the Mind as thought. From this substance 
we are building up our personality self-awareness. So from the 
same substance we can construct a good, loYing and wise 
personality or a disgruntled, suffering personality. 
It is not tl1e substance we use but what we do with it that 
makes the difference. It is just like in the physical world, we can 
take wood, glass, iron and concrete to build a beautiful  palace or 
from the same material we can build a prison. The choice is ours, 
we can dress our self in unclean thoughts and emotions or we can 
dress our self in the luminosity of loving feelings and noble 
thoughts. 
So we will initially work with our personal capacity of 
forming Mind into thoughts, which serve as mirrors to see and 
know things. With this way we have two points: the object of 
our 
study and the person doing the study. This way leads to 
knowledge. Later we will not work only in this limited way 
but 
in 
another better way. Then we will use another means of 
researching that does not require us to focus on an object we 
112 

wan
t to know. 
Then we will 
use 
the 
ivli
nd 
in 
a

not to knowledge but to

m. 
Kno
wle
dge is not 
wisdom 
but it directs 
us 
to wisdo

b
e
tt
er m
eans 
of using 
the Mind is called 
Attunem
ent, 
which leads 
to 
At-
one-m
ent.  Now the researcher 
become
s 
one 
with the 
o
bj
ect 
and 
knows it 
directly 
and not through 
some 
external 
study. 
No
w we 
understand 
though 
assimilation 
with the object. 
This is a 
capacity beyond time and space. 
Beyond 
space, 
means 
that you do not have to physically 
see 
a tree 
you want to know 
about. 
The distance 
between 
you an<l 
the object of study no longer matters. How is it we know 
something that we cannot see with the material light?  Well there 
is light beyond the ordinary physical light.  This light is the 
Noetical 
light. 
With the Noetical 
light we can perceive 
and know 
the 
tree.  We can do this provided 
we are able to attune 
to the 
vib
rations 
the tree 
emits, 
which 
are carried 
on the 
Noeti
c
al light. 
When 
we are 
able to perceive 
this light, we will be 
able to 
a
ttu
ne our 
self to the 
vibrations 
of the object 
and 
know it 
fully. 
So 
thi
s 
abilit
y is bey
ond what we call space. 
Space do
e
s 
no

exis
t

t 
thi

level 
since 
we can get these percepti
ons 
no matter 
what the 
dist

W
ith 
this 
method 
we do not

With

hod a 
113 

mystic 
will 
get the 
full 
and 
complete 
knowledge 
of the 
tree 
in an 
instant. 
Before 
we can 
close 
and 
open 
our 
eyes 
we will 
have 
full 
and 
complete 
knowledge 
of that tree. 
So this 
higher 
capacity 
to 
know 
is beyond 
the 
sense 
of time 
as well. 
Admittedly 
this 
is all very 
advanced 
stuff. 
But 
there 
are 
Researchers 
of Truth 
today 
who 
do use 
this 
method. 
But 
they 
are 
using 
the 
super 
substance 
of mind 
not 
as a personality 
in receivin
g 
the 
impressions 
through 
the 
five 
senses. 
They 
are using 
the 
Mind 
in a higher 
and 
better 
way 
as the 
inner 
self. 
Reaching 
this 
level 
we 
may 
be tempted 
to think 
that 
our 
capabilities 
to research 
and 
know 
have 
grown 
immensely. 
But 
it is not 
our 
capabilities 
that 
have 
grown. 
It is that 
our 
awareness 
of the 
higher 
capabilities 
of 
our 
inner  self  that 
has 
grown. 
So clearly 
human 
beings 
think, 
but 
do Archangelic 
Beings 
think? 
The 
Archangels 
definitely 
meditate. 
But 
do they 
really 
think? 
Yes 
but 
not 
with 
a material 
brain. 
They 
get an archetypal 
idea, 
like 
of a tree 
from 
the 
Noetic 
State. 
They 
consciously 
project 
it as a psycho-Noetical 
form-thought. 
They 
continue 
lowering 
its vibrations 
until 
they 
literally 
materialize 
the 
thoug
ht 
as 
a living 
tree 
though 
the 
circles 
of possibilities 
contained 
in its 
seed. 
114 

N
ow 
what 
is the 
relationship 
between 
Medi
t
ation and 
th
ou
ght? 
It is the 
same as the relationshi
p 
between a 
cause and 
e
ff
e
ct. 
M
edita
tion 
is the cause and thought 
is 
the effect 
or resul
t
. 
Or 
we 
could 
metaph
orically say Meditatio
n is like 
the na
t
ure of 
a 
tr
ee, and 
thoughts 
are like the fruit of 
the 
tree. 
In the case of the Archangels, they project the form from 
the archetypal idea and manifest it into the three worlds of 
existence. The forms they project and materialize are ali,·e -they 
live!  The thoughts human beings project and construct in the 
world do not live. In building the living form they dress it in a 
certain order, layer by layer as it were.  It is something like how we 
dress ourselves layer by layer.  We first put on an undershin, a 
shirt, a sweater and then the jacket.  We do not put the undershirt 
over the jacket.  The building up of the forms must occur in a 
certain successive order of the different kinds of i\lind. 
The 
order is 
this.  First the Archangelic builders 
d
r
ess 
the 
Noetic 
archetypal idea in 
the higher Noetical 
substance, then 
l
ow
er 
Noetical 
substance and its ethereal 
counterp
a
rt. 
Then they 
d
re
ss 
it in the 
psychical substance 
and its 
ethereal 
coun
t
erp
art
. 
No
w 
the 
psychical is the expression 
of i\lin
d th
a
t 
gives 
desire 
a 
kind 
of 
will 
for the 
expression 
of that 
form
.  Fin

dress and is 
the lowest

the

115 

But as a personality 
we do it differently. 
We draw from the 
formless 
super substance 
of mind and start to concentrate.

\\\'henever 
someone 
starts to meditate 
and think, this Mind super 
substance 
is given form.  The form that is given is something 
specific 
to that person. 
It is that person's 
own thought 
taking 
form.  Now it belongs 
to them.  So whenever 
a person starts to 
mediate and 
think, he or she is automatically 
giving a specific 
form to the formless 
Mind super substance. 
This is not how 
the Archangels 
do it.  They do 
not have to 
get the ;,,find; they emanate 
the Mind directly 
from themselves. 
W'hy, because 
as we said many times, God's Will-Pleasure 
to 
manifest 
itself causes the Mind to emanate 
from God and all the 
eternal spirit 
beings in God.  So because 
of their continued 
oneness 
with God, the Archangels 
are emanating 
this Divine 
super substance 
from their own being.  They cannot 
formulate 
something 
unique and personal. 
They can only work within the 
Divine Plan. 
Man 
on the other hand, can and does make specific 
forms 
from the Mind according 
to their own positive 
or negative 
interests 
and whims. 
This is how we get the human 
in nature 
116 

d
e
m
on
s 
and 
ang
els
.  The 
human 
in nature 
demons 
have onlv  been 
c
r
ea
t
e
d 
by 
man
kind and not by the Archang
els or 
even by 
t�e so­
ca
ll
e
d 
Fallen 
Ang
els
.  Mankind 
has done 
this 
to itself, 
by 
imbu
ing 
cr
ea
t
e
d 
form
s 
with n
e
gative thoughts 
and 
emo
tions. 
But it is different with the Archangels they do not put any 
personal emotion into the thought forms they create. They can 
o
nly create according to the Divine Plan. 
Mankind from the lower Noetical World down to the 
material world creates some thought-emotion forms but mostly 
emotional-thought forms. 
So we should study all these things and it    is important to 
study how our personality self is made up from the thoughts and 
emotions we harbor and express.  Our personality is built up with 
these thought and emotion forms through the etheric vitality. To 
understand this we have to dive into our sub consciousness, learn 
about it and clean it.  Then we can safely proceed to the Psychical 
World.

the elementals we harbor and project. These elementals are 
stored in our sub consciousness. 
So we clean our sub consciousness, and then proceed to 
the 
psychical world. In  this way we will be able to see the 
Psychical World truly as they are and not through the filters of 
our own elementals. You do not want to go to the psychical 
world after you pass over and continue building a little illusionar
y 
shell world within the real and gloriously luminous Psychical 
World. As there are dangers in this world there are dangers in the 
other worlds.  These dangers are the illusions we create and take 
to be real. 
This is why it is so im
p
ortant to start cleaning our sub 
consciousness of negativity and illusion right now while living on 
Earth. Otherwise when we pass over we will just create a shell 
according to the feelings, desires and thoughts stored in our sub 
consciousness. 

Question 
Q. 
I have a 
question 
about 'right 
think
ing' 
I 
ha
ve 
read in 
the Esoteric Teachings 
and 
heard you 
said 
many 
ti
m
es in 
lessons on 
the radio that the best 
way 
to dis-en
ergize 
the 
e
le
men
tals is to not 
pay attention 
to them.  Daily, 
I am 
catching 
m
y 
tho
ughts when they 
go in the 'wrong' direct
ion (
negat
i
v
i
ty
, 
e
tc.) 
and stop 
them 
by simply saying to myself "I am 
not going to 
th
ink 
about it, this is not right".  I have 
gotten very 
good at it 
acrually. 
However, I am also realizing now that this is not proactive. 
I don't just want to stop the incorrect thinking, I want to start 
"right thinking" ... and this is where I got stuck. I actually don't 
know what kind of thinking is beneficial to the spiritual 
development. What should I think about?  Not when meditating, 
but during quite mundane activities like drh�ng, shopping, 
working etc. 
I 
just feel 
that this constant 
stream of thought 
can be 
dir
ected for 
the better 
somehow. 
So what do 
Resear
chers of 
Tru
th 
think 
about or 
should think about 
in 
their 
day-to
-day life? 
A. 
Very 
Good 
question!  Right thinking 
is to put 
the mind 
a
s 
r
e
ason in 
char
ge of your emotion
s, 
desir
es 
and 
behav
iours. 
W
h
er
e 
we 
get 
into 
trouble is we let our 
emoti
ons and 
desires 
d
o
m
in
ate 
over 
reas
onable thought. 
Our 
mind 
sho
uld 
be the 
119 

master of our emotions and desires, which means we should use 
reason to  decide what emotions and desires we should express. 
This 
is  self-mastery. We have spoken of the need to shape our 
ps,·chical body, the body of our emotions and desires, to match 
that of the perfect archetype. How? The psychical body does 
not 
shape itself. The  only  way to shape our psychical body into that 
of its archetype is by using the Noetical body, the mental body of 
thought. This  means we must use our mind as reasonable 
thinking to govern our emotions and desires. 
Unfortunately today, 80% of the time most people are 
making their mind the slave of their desires and emotions. For 
example, we see something in the material world that attracts our 
interest and we want to know it and own it. So we start  using the 
mind to find a way of getting that desired item. Maybe we get a 
second job, or a loan to pay for it. So we start using our mind to 
find a way to satisfy our desires. But  with right thinking we first 
use the mind as reason to analyse the desire before  expressing it. 
So we use the mind to determine: Is it  necessary to have this 
desired item right now? If we fulfil our desire, what will it bring 
us? What is the real cost of our desire? How much trouble must 
we go through co get it?   Once we get it  then what? You will 
notice that once a desire is fulfilled we soon get tired of it and 
new desires will arise. So that is an example of ri
g
ht thinkin
g
, to 
120 

u
se 
our 
mind 
to determine  what 
is 
n
ecess
ary 
an
d 
what 
is 
u
n
ne
cessa
r
y
.    R
eall
y 
what 
is it in us, 
which 
desires 
to do 
so
m
ething that  is unnecessary? 
W
hen 
you 
are doing 
something 
mundane 
make 
an effort 
to 
sta
y fu
lly 
prese
nt. 
This 
brings 
you into the Now 
and habitual 
thi
n
ki
n
g is replace 
by 
obser
v
ing
, 
and when 
necessary
, 
respond
ing 
w
ith 
right 
action. 
But at this stage 
it is hard 
for a 
personali
ty to 
do 
all the time. 
So we can give our lower 
mind 
or 
thinking 
mind 
some
thing 
constructive 
to do so it does 
not sub-cons
ciously 
engage in wrong or aimless thinking. 
The Hindus teach mantra for this, and so do Christian 
mystics. The old classic one is to inwardly repeat: "Lord have 
mercy upon us according to your loving kindness." Or Christ 
taught 
it:  "Lord, 
look 
down 
upon 
us". 
Christ 
also showed 
his 
disciples 
how 
to make  that  prayer 
more 
powerful 
by doing 
certain 
visualizations while repeating the affirmation. 
We 
can also 
do like the Buddhist 
and other 
systems 
teach. 
T
hey 
advise to simply watch your 
breathing 
- to 
gently stay 
co
ns
cious 
of your 
inhaling 
and exhaling. 
Th
ese tech

The

you into

121 

and also protect you from undesirable elementals. 
But when you need to think rightly about a subject, use 
reason, logic and most important take your time thinking it 
through. Do not be in a hurry. Don't jump to conclusions. Take 
your 
time to think it through to the end. Right thinking leads 
somewhere. It leads to logical, dependable conclusions. 
Wrong or aimless thinking is when your thoughts and 
feelings turn over and over in your head in a repetitive way and 
you lose control of the thought process itself. In this case the 
emotion/thought elementals end up dominating. Wrong thinking 
never leads you to a definite conclusion because it tends to go in a 
circular pattern. With this kind of thinking you just go round and 
round and round in your head, which in the end just winds you up 
and can make you feel crazy. 
As you have already observed when your thoughts or 
feelings go in the wrong way, you can catch it and stop it after the 
fact.  As you get more skilful at this practice you will notice you 
start catching them in real time as they start to form. Then with 
more practice you will start to see situations that are about to arise 
that could trigger negative thoughts or feelings and you will then 
proactively prevent them from arising in you.

Meditation 
Relax 
your 
body, 
still your thoughts 
and silence 
your 
e
m
oti
ons. 
Take 
a few deep and comfort
able 
brea
ths. 
There 
sh
ould be no tension 
anywhere 
in your 
body. 
You know very little about your material body. You don't 
know much about how it works or even much about the organs in 
it and yet it's your body and it working in good order. 
The holy Archangels are now working in your material 
body. Every hair on your body is numbered and is growing, but 
you don't give any value to that work. 
The holy Archangels are supplying your body with vitality. 
You are living in this material body by grace and not by right 
because you did not create your body the Archangels did.  The 
holy Archangels don't mind if you call it "your bod)''. It is your 
body, given to you to express yourself in and through. But you 
did not create it - they did. 
Now, 
breathe deeply. Now forget you have a 
name. 
For
get that 
you're a  man or a woman! 
Now ask 
yourself 
this 
que
stio
n: "'IX'ho 
am I?  I am living. 
I am alive. 
But 
Who am I"? 
A
gain
, 
forget 
you have a name! 
Forget 
your 
have the body 
o
f 
a 
ma
n 
or a 
wom
a
n
l  I
n 
your Divine 
nature, 
you are not 
a man 
o
r 
a 
wo
man 
but a 
Spirit 
Soul. 
Ask sinc
erely: 
"Wh
o am I? 
What 
a
m 
I?" 
123 

Expect that your holy Archangel, the Guardian 
Archangel, 
will answer these two questions at the right moment. Maybe not 
in this moment but stay alert and expect his reply at a time he 
chooses. It could be some hours or a few days so keep the 
expectation of his answer that will come. These are two distinct 
and different questions. "What am I?" and 'Who am I?"  Ask this 
dual question because in the worlds of existence, we are dual. 
Everything is dual in these worlds. 
Ask your Guardian Archangel and Christ Logos to guide 
you through the duality and in to the One-ness. 
The practice of Introspection benefits us with certain 
privileges but there are also perils associated this practice we must 
be aware of.  In the next lesson we will look at the dangers we can 
encounter during Introspection.

INTR

We 
are 
born into 
this world 
as a boy or girl 
and live for six 
or

without much sense 
of self. 
They

What 
they know 
at that

that

As an  infant 
they

When 
it is 
hungry, 
the

for the breast 
of its mother 
to feed. 
S
o the 
little 
girl or boy is living 
instinctually 
and its mat
e
rial 
body 
starts developing and growing. Everyone's material body lives 
instinctively from cradle to grave. 
But this is the life of our material body and not our self. As 
the material body grows in to a young boy or girl, the sense of self 
very 
slowly 
starts 
to 
form 
and there 
is more

organs, hair and so on.  These components of a human body are 
all similar to the components of animal's bodies. But a human 
being 
is much more than just a material body. Our material body 
grows instinctively and is built up by the intelligent supervision of 
the 
Archangels of the Elements, who continue to sustain it.  They 
haYe within them the Divine Plan concerning the development of 
a human body and they build on that blueprint. This is to say; the 
Archangels ha\·e and work on the entire Circle of Possibility for 
our material body's existence. They do the same for the psychical 
and Noetical bodies, which are not yct visible to most people. 
The material body does not need a name. But now there is 
another condition, we start to see a self-consciousness manifestin
g 
in the material body.  It is a "time and place" self and as it starts 
its own life in the material body it needs a name.  From the 
beginning of its material life, each man or woman is hearing itself 
call a name that was given to him or her by his or her parents. 
The developing child concentrates and creates around this name a 
sense of self and begins to express its real Self sub-consciously by 
adding to its given name the "I Am".  A young boy or girl will 
identify itself as "I Arn" and then adds its given name. So the 
child will say I am John or I am Heather. Here we can see the 
whole truth.  The "!" is the Spirit, the Am is the Soul and the 
given name of John or Heather is the personality. Each of us has 
126 

b
ee
n 
stating 
that great 
truth 
our whole 
life 
without 
really 
un
derstanding the meaning of 
it. 
The 
I 
Am   is 
common 
to all human 
beings
; it is 
our 
S
e
lfh
ood. 
Yet now 
we 
see our Selfhood 
covere
d with 
the 
name 
of 
a 
male 
or female 
creating 
a tempora
ry 
perso
nality 
aroun
d all 
th
at.  Now 
we see a new 
entit
y 
in time and place, 
which 
is very 
diff
erent 
than 
the I Am. 
So we need 
to contem
plate and 
meditate 
on the great difference between these two. 
Then 
we can look at 
the difference 
between the other 
personalities and different ways of sub-conscious living. We can 
see  there is a slight difference between the Circle of Possibility for 
the  material body of a woman and the Circle of Possibility for the 
material body of a man. We also haYe the full Circle of 
Possibi
lities 
for the human 
being, 
which 
is common 
to both 
man 
and 
woman. 
The 
entire 
Circle 
of Possibilities 
for a human 
is not 
just 
about 
the material 
body, 
so we have 
to study 
it from 
all 
a
ngles, 
becaus
e it includes 
the entire 
Circle 
of 
Possibili
ties of 
a 
hu
man 
being, 
the 
Son of Man 
and a god. 
We 
have 
a 
huma

Divin

We are both. 
Both

Circle

consciousness 
creating 
the personality. 
'VI.le 
can study 
our sub­
consciousness 
and classify 
the different 
thoughts, 
emotions, 
desires, 
intentions, 
and motivations 
using 
the i'vlind. 
God 
has 
given 
each 
of us the ability 
to use the lvlind 
directly. 
The animals 
have 
no access 
to the lvlind. 
Again 
the lvlind 
is not the material 
brain 
any more 
that electricity 
is a battery. 
The material 
brain 
is 
like 
a battery 
that can be highly 
charged 
with the Mind 
as we see 
in brilliant 
people 
or just slightly 
charged 
with the i'vlind 
as we see 
in other 
people. 
Clearly 
it is not the material 
brain, 
which 
is 
creating 
the Mind. 
We all have 
the some 
amount 
of brains 
but 
we all do not have 
same 
degree 
of the i'vlind. 
If the brain 
was 
creating 
the Mind 
then 
we all would 
have 
the same 
degree 
of 
Mind 
and we obviously 
don't. 
Also 
the animals 
have brains, 
some 
animals 
have 
bi
gg
er and maybe 
better 
brains 
than 
we do but they 
have 
no access 
to the Mind. 
So by using 
the Mind 
Self Consciously 
we are able to reach 
the truth 
of what 
we are. 
Most 
people 
are using 
the Mind 
now 
but mostly 
sub-consciously 
just living 
like all the other 
people 
around 
us without 
really 
understanding 
what 
the Mind 
is.  Most 
do not know 
they are using 
the Super-Substance 
of the Mind 
sub­
consciously 
or that such 
a thing 
even 
exists! 
Using 
the i'vlind 
sub­
consciously, 
we are just manifesting 
one of the branches 
of the 
Circle 
of  Possibilities 
for a human 
being. 
In this branch 
we 
see 
128

s· th 
h   -

exp

g desires 
endlessly. 
This 
"
desiring" 
has 
to be 
ex
ten

We 
must 
investiga
te 
what 
a 
desire 
is, why 
we 
d
e
sir
e a p
artic
ular 
thing 
or experience, 
what we 
think 
our 
desires 
gi
ve 
us  and 
what 
is it that 
we really  want. 
How 
many 
peop
le 
an
alyze 
their desires like that? Instead of 
thinking 
desires 
thr
ough, 
most 
just 
express 
the desire 
then 
enslave 
the Super­
Subs
tance 
of the 
Mind 
to figure 
out a way 
to get their 
d
es
ires. 
Desiring is a way of life for us and we should study and 
know it in ourselves. Then we can go further in this way and 
study our feelings and our emotions, because the emotions are 
not exactly the  same as the desires. Sometimes the effect is the 
same  but emotions and desires do not have the same nature.  So 
we need to study that using the Mind. But we cannot study that 
as long as the Mind is enslaved to desires. Seriously study
i
ng 
desires and emotions we can see how we have made them the 
master of the Mind, enslaving it.  The ]\find should be the master 
a
nd  not  the slave.

our self, but egoism is not our real Self, it is an idol we have 
c
reated. Often, if other people are not agreeing with our feelings 
then we may feel the others are against our self. This personal 
egoism 
is not our Self. It is a false idol that Daskalos called, "A 
human demon; a human in nature demon that is making us blind 
to the reality." Throughout our whole life it is gaining an 
adnntage over us, making us believe we are benefiting our Self by 
subjugating the Nlind Super-Substance in order to satisfy the 
emotions and desires. 
So it needs a lot of study using Observation to break this 
habit and start to use the Mind Super Substance properly. Up to 
this point this idol of egoism, this human demon appears to us 
saying, "I am you." Notice it will not say, "I am I."  It cannot say 
that because it is not your Self. So now we see in us a duality, one 
is the real Self and the other is the mimicking  egoism that 
pretends to be you. So this is the point we begin to analyze and 
compare the two. One is the real Self the other is its shadow. 
Now you start to understand your duality in the Worlds of 
Existence.  Everything in the Worlds of Existence is dual. So we 
have the Soul Self casting a shadow self in time, space and place. 
It is not possible to have this shadow without something castin
g 
the shadow. The ray of the Soul Self is in the shadow self 
otherwise the shadow self could not exist. The Soul Self is 
lat
ent 
130 

in the personalit
y 
of a man or woman. This means that it is the 
Soul Self that allows the shadow self with its weaknesses and 
faults to appear. You are both the Soul Self and its shadow self_ 
the personality's egoism. You are dual in one and this is true for 
e
veryon
e
. 
But the real question is, "How much of the time is the 
egoistic shadow dominating and in conttol and How much of 
time is the Soul Self controlling the shadow self?"  We can easily 
find that out by Introspection in the  examination of our beha,�or, 
our thinking, our desires, and our feelings.  Using Introspection to 
study all these things is like holding a searchlight in  your hand and 
entering the dark unknown parts of your own sub-consciousness. 
The searchlight is the intention to know the truth and using this 
light we can find the truth. 
What 
truth do we 
find?  We find out why.  Searching 
for 
w
hy 
things are the 
way they are become
s 
a brilliant 
ligh
t 
that 
h
elp
s 
us 
find 
the truth. 
We find the truth of why we 
think t
h
e 
way we 
d
o. 
We 
find the 
truth of why we desire having 
certain 
thing
s s
o 
str
o

But here is the danger in sear

the
s
e 
"w

you 
have

131 

during 
Introspection, 
be ,·er y careful. 
Do not allow 
the petty 
personality 
self to take this search 
light from the 
hands 
of your 
Soul Self and start to use it in a negative 
way. 
So to find the real conditions 
concerning 
our life we have 
the 
search 
in our sub-consciousness. 
The exercise 
given 
for this 
search 
is daily Introspection. 
We do this at the 
end of the day 
before 
going 
to sleep. 
We enter 
a calm 
state, 
by quieting 
down 
our emotions 
and silencing 
all thoughts 
except 
one. 
The one 
thought 
we keep 
is the thought, 
"I want 
to know 
the truth." 
We 
want 
to know 
the truth 
about 
the object 
of our investigation: 
such 
as a desire, 
a feeling 
or a behavior. 
Now 
we use a latent 
Divine 
Power, 
which 
is Visualization. 
We have not been 
taught 
about 
our Divine 
Powers 
of 
Observation 
and Visualization 
or how to develop 
them and 
use 
them 
for our benefit. 
We can consciousl
y 
visualize 
events, 
people, 
places, 
and things. 
We do it all the time sub-consciously, 
but now we need 
to use this Divine 
power 
of the Soul 
consciousl
y
.  Introspection 
means 
to bring 
to your conscious 
mind, 
an event 
that happened 
during 
the day. 
That 
event 
had 
been stored 
in your sub-consciousness, 
but now we bring 
it up to 
the surface 
of our consciousness. 
Maybe 
there 
was an event 
where 
you had a 
misunderstanding 
or a quarrel 
with someone 
and discordant 
132 

w
or
ds 
w
ere 
exc
hange
d.  Now 
you 
study 
that 
ev
ent from 
all sides 
u
s
ing 
Visua
lization. 
Now 
you 
can  see 
it  all 
happ
enin
g 
again in 
yo
ur 
V
isual
izatio
n. 
Here 
comes 
a danger 
again. 
You
r egoism 
will 
ju
m
p 
in and  draw 
your 
attention 
to what  the 
other 
p
erson 
was 
do
ing 
or saying 
wrong. 
Now 
it is easy  to 
rememb
er and 
focu
s on 
th
e 
harsh 
words 
others 
say 
to  you, 
and 
i
gn
ore 
or m
inimize 
the 
har
sh 
words 
or actions 
you 
have 
done. 
\
X
ben 
this 
happens 
you 
have 
to say, 
"No!" 
You 
have 
to insist 
to  observe 
the 
whole 
event 
from 
both  sides 
as a detached 
witness 
and 
not 
just 
see it  from 
the 
biased view of the egoism. 
So we must use Concentration during Introspection to see 
the people, their faces, the scenery and everything in the event 
clearly and in a neutral way. But you are not doing this 
visualization 
as the personality, 
because 
egoism 
cannot 
see things 
in 
a neutral 
way. 
It can 
only 
see 
things 
fonn 
its own 
vested 
in
terest 
and 
it will 
explain 
what happened 
according 
to its bias. 
It 
will 
just 
make 
excuse
s for 
its bad behavior 
and 
pretend 
it was 
your 
b
ad 
behavior
.  So we 
are 
not 
to allow 
our 
egois
m to 
get a h  old 
of 
t
h
e I
ntro
spectio
n 
proce
ss. 
Introspection 
is done 
as the 
Soul 
Self 
wi
th 
the 
aim 
of disti
ng  uishing 
the 
egoism, 
the 
shad
ow 
self, 
form 
t
h
e 
S
oul 
Self
. 
Now 
you 
are 
in a better 
vanta
ge 
point 
to see thin
g
s 
ri
gh
tly. 
133 

As you examine the whole event to observe the mistakes 
and 
wrongs the other person did, you will start the analysis and 
say, 
"Yes I heard these hard words from the other person, but 
what did I reply?" You ask yourself, "Should I have said that? 
What was the result of saying that? Did it help or did it create 
more confusion and trouble?" But again we come to a danger, 
because at this important point in your Introspection, your 
egoism comes forward and to deceive you saying something like, 
"This person hurt your fillings or did this or that wrong thing to 
you. They have no right to talk to you that way. You are right to 
be  angry and tell  them  they are wrong." This is the  point in our 
Introspection Daskalos calls  the precious moment. It is precious 
because our inner adversary has revealed its self and we can catch 
it and stop it.  Now you can see that during that misunderstanding 
with someone your egoism got control and acting in your name, it 
behaved badly. 
Egoism is very, very cleaver but it is also stupid because it 
is so self-absorbed that it cannot  suspect  that you are trying to 
discover it.  Now you can see the difference between you and the 
egoism clearly. So a most important part in Introspection is to 
try to understand who you are as a thinking reasoning Soul Self. 
By checking your behavior, you will be able to control this human 
demon called egoism.

Wh

(remove
d) is the 
energy 
we 
p
ut 
into 
them 
and in 
doing 
so we in effect 
kill 
them 
in us. 
To do 
th
is 
we 
clean 
and purify 
our personali
ty'
s egoism 
and 
transmut
e i
t 
in
to y
our real Self. 
Because 
its life is you, you have 
given 
it life; 
yo
u are 
its pulse 
of life. You 
must 
withdraw 
the life 
you give by 
your 
attention 
to the negative 
elementals 
and thus 
de-energiz
e 
them and transmute egoism into your real Self. 
This process is what Christ was referring to  when he said, 
"The mortal will become immorral." The mortal personality self 
becomes 
transmuted 
into the Immortal 
Soul Self. 
So we should 
not 
try to kill the 
personality 
self, which 
is not even 
possible. 
Inst
ead we are to 
transmute 
the changing 
personality 
self 
into the 
changeless everlasting Self. 
Again 
we will 
face a danger 
in trying 
to do this, because 
in 
t
he 
beginning the egoism will  react 
terribly and 
rri· 
many, 
many 
tr
ic
ks 
to 
deceiv
e you 
and prevent 
you from 
trans
mutin
g it. 
Its 
r
e
ac
tions 
are a like 
the story 
of a boy 
who 
finds 
a 
lepr
echa
un in 
t
h
e 
w
oo
ds.  T
he 
boy 
sneaks 
up on it and tries 
to  catch 
it, 
knowi
ng 
t
h
at 
if 
he 
can 
catch it 
and hold 
on to it, 
the 
lepr
echa
un 
will hav
e 
t
o 
g
iv
e 
him 
its 
gold. 
So the bov jumps 
out and 
catch
es hold of 
135 

the leprechaun. Immediately the leprechaun turns itself into a 
la
rge snake, but the boy holds on. Then the leprechaun turns 
itself into a tiger, but the boy does not let go. The leprechaun 
changes from one alarming apparition to another and finally turn
s 
into a flame of fire, but the boy continue to hold on. Finally the 
leprechaun  exhausts all its tricks and surrenders and the boy gets 
the pot of gold. 
Now the quality of egoism varies greatly  between different 
people. We each have our own brand of egoism. Some are not 
so bad, some are very bad, some are extremely bad and some are 
criminal. But all egoisms are deceiving people into believing the,· 
are something they are not and distract people from realizing their 
true Self. So there can be a terrible fight  when trying to catch the 
egoism; it is fighting you.  Just like the  leprechaun, it is a shape 
shifter. It will continuously change and present new faces. Be 
aware that if  fighting does not work, your egoism will try a 
completely different approach masquerading as a repenting, 
remorseful sinner and feel sorry for itself in a masochistic way. 
Do allow your egoism to present you in this way. 
1 f  you are unrelenting in your effon to transmute your 
egoism into your real Self, just like the leprechaun it will 
e,cntually run out of tricks. So do not try to fight that group 
elemental called your egoism. Instead cry to use reason to 
136 

c
o
n
vince 
you
r 
person
ality self that it is 
in its 
own 
best 
interest to 
c
o
o
perate in its 
transmutation 
to the 
Soul 
Self
. 
Actu
ally 
the 
p
e
rso
nality 
likes to 
feel it is the Soul Self.  It 
is only 
the 
obstinacy 
of 
the 
egoism that objects 
to the trans
muta
tion. 
T
his is 
the way 
we 
tea
ch for 
de-en
ergizing 
the group of elemen
tals in our 
sub 
con
sciousness 
we call 
egoism. 
In the beginning we srudy and know our personality self in 
its duality in its positiYe and negatiYe aspects. Realizing all that, 
we seek to save what is positi,·e and eradicate what is negative. If 
people could li,·e like that eYery day their life would immediately 
be happier. There was an upbeat song like that in the 40's "ith the 
lyrics that went: "Y ou'ye got to accentuate the positi,·e, eliminate 
the negati,·e and don't mess with l\lister In-Between." Christ said 
it this way:  "All you need to say is simply 'Yes' or ':s.o'; anything 
beyond this comes from the 
C\
-il one" 
By  stud
�ing our personalit
y 
self it leads us to be 
able to 
dis
tin
guish its 
difference from the Soul Self. To 
know 
what our 
ma
terial 
body 
looks like we 
use a mirror to 
see it by refl
ection. 
\'f
e 
can 
also 
see and 
know our Soul Self bY 
reflec
tion 
but it an 
in
n
er 
reflection and not an outer 
one.

realiry. In general, these reflections are mirrored back to us in our 
relationships, in our jud
gm
ents and self-perceptions. There is no 
need to go into them tonight because the best way of reflection is 
inner reflection, which we have  given  many times. This  way is 
Introspection using visualization to examine our perceptions, 
thoughts, feelings and actions. This self-examination was taught 
by the early desert fathers (hermit monks) such as Saint Anthony, 
who stated: "An unexamined life is not worth living". 
Visualization is not fantasy. But during Introspection how 
can we tell if we are visualizing which is real or if we are 
fantasizing which is unreal. In fantasizing we are creating unreal 
images based on real things. For example if you close your eyes 
and can see Pegasus the horse with wings that can fly you are 
fantasizing. You take the image of a horse and the image of 
wings, both of which are real and you combine them into the 
fantasy of a flying horse, which is not real. 
Imagining is natural for the personality but you cannot 
imagine things that are not based on something real you have 
already seen or know about. So imagining things we are just 
replaying what has been stored in our sub-consciousness. But 
even the tendency to imagine is showing that we have the abi
li
t
y 
to visualize and see things. It will take practice to be able to do 
form creation by Visualization. It takes time for your personality

will also 
lead to 
being

So 
it is 
ok to 
imagin

in 
order 
to 
und

imaginings 
are reflections 
from 
real

reflections 
are 
not real 
but 
what 
is being 
reflected 
on the lake is real.  Proceed 
and 
study 
in 
this way  and 
one day there 
will be a shift, 
and you find yo

You can mo,·e and do things

world. But you are in the Psychical \'\'odd now, and you will be 
sure 
of it because 
you will see things 
you neYer 
saw on Earth 
and 
s
o you 
can be sure you are not imagining 
them. 
Again 
this is

cannot

that are not

go without much effort to the psychical planes as easily as anyone 
can go to the next room in their house. There are many other 
rooms to enter and see in the house of our father God. Christ 
said that and then he finished saying, "If that were not so, would J 
have told you." 

Questions 
Q. 
In the 
class Friday in New Jersey, (and in   a pm·ious 
ra
dio 
show), you 
referred 
to the concept 
that we  do 
not choose 
o
ur 
next 
incarnation
, as some believe. It is mor
e 
a 
matt
e
r of th
e 
l
ev
el of our 
vibration. 
Again, please give more 
examples 
or 
exp
lanations. 
We have two Grandsons 
whose father is rather skilled 
at 
emotional 
abuse, rage, 
and terrorizing. 
The thought that these 
boys may have chosen him, for some higher reason, gives 
momentary 
comfort. 
If they were attracted 
to his vibration, 
it 
would seem 
that they might be working 
through 
some of the 
same stuff their father displays? 
Please clarify. 
A. The idea that we choose our parents is a popular notion 
in spiritual circles 
today.  So naturally 
some students 
raised this 
question 
with Daskalos. 
To which he replied that was not the 
case.  He further emphasized 
- "No one ever asked me whom I 
wanted 
to incarnate 
with.'' 
Of course we can say God decides who our parents are. 
We can also rightly say the Lords of Karma, the Archangels 
of the 
Elements, 
decide this.  But to give an example 
of the Laws 
governing 
this Daskalos 
describes 
the process 
with an analo
gy
. 

When it is time for the Soul to send a Ray of itself into the 
worlds 
of Existence to be dressed in bodies for incarnation, this 
Ray descends from the Noetic State, through the Noetical World 
and onto the Psychical World where it gets dressed in a psychical 
body. Now at this level there is a pause and the person has to 
wait for a time while the appropriate circumstances for a physical 
birth come together. 
This all depends on the person's karma and the karma of 
the candidates for their parents. Then when the right  situation is 
available, pregnancy and birth occurs. So we have  the example of 
something like a colander or  basket  with many different size holes 
in it.  We fill that basket with balls of many different sizes  and 
sizes then we  shake it.  Sooner or later each ball  comes to the hole 
matching its  size  shape and slips through. Similarly different 
Souls already dressed in a psychical and Noetical body find a 
fitting opportunity, based on the law of karma, to find the right 
parents to give them birth into physical incarnation and offer their 
next life lessons. 
Children's main life lessons typical involve both parents 
to 
some degree. While there is not much comfort in believing 
children choose tough parents to get tough lessons. There is 
comfort in knowing that this process is governed by God's laws 
and implemented by Archangelic Orders with total Wisdom &

Q. It seems very, very difficult for me to get anything out

Introspection 
it tries to distract, 
confuse, 
block, 
deny, 
blame 
and 
so many 
other 
tricks. 
You need 
to silence 
this egoism 
when 
you 
start the practice 
of Introspection 
or Meditation. 
W'hen 
it comes 
forward 
to defend 
a wrong 
action 
it starts 
making 
arguments 
like 
a tricky 
lawyer. 
It will exonerate 
you and lay the blame 
on 
external 
circumstances 
and/ or other 
people. 
Now 
is the time 
to 
discover 
it and catch 
it.  If that misleading 
trick 
does 
not work 
it 
often 
reverses 
it approach 
and will try to make 
you feel bad or 
guilty 
about 
your 
mistakes. 
Again 
this is a precious 
moment 
when 
you can catch it
.  But be careful 
because 
egoism 
is a two faced 
liar. 
It particularly 
makes 
a strong 
approach 
to blind 
you when 
you are 
just about 
to come 
to a liberating 
conclusion. 
If your 
egoism 
is overgrown 
and swollen 
with itself, 
it is 
even 
more 
difficult 
to deal with as it tries to block 
you at every 
turn. 
But when you detect 
its opposition 
you have 
the 
opportunity 
to see it, catch 
it and render 
it harmless. 
But how can 
we do that? 
We do that by becoming 
disinterested 
in whatever we 
think 
the egoistic expression is offering 
us.  And good 
Introspection 
will reveal 
where 
we are getting 
hooked 
on the idea 
that egoism 
is offering 
or ever could offer 
something 
beneficial 
to 
our real Self. 
First 
of all before 
you start Introspection 
try to slow 
your 
thoughts 
and feelings 
way down. 
If we are not  deep  and  calm 
as 
144 

w
e 
be
gin 
Int
ros
pection it is 
like travelling 
down a 
road at 90 
miles 
p
er 
ho
ur.  It is 
very 
hard 
to see anv 
detail of 
yours 
d' 
� 
urr
ou
n 
mg 
e
n
vir
onm
ent m
oving 
at that speed. 
So take a 
few 
minutes to 
do 
d
ee
p 
com
fortab
le 
breaths, 
silence 
your 
thoug
hts and 
emotio
ns

you are just

e
nts 
yo
u 
are

introspect

begin. 
But 
do not be

hu
rr
y. 
Go   very 
slow 
and obser
v
e very 
carefully 
this 
takes the 
skill 
of 
Co
ncentration. 
So try it this way and when 
you find 
som
ething 
off in your 
behaviour 
zero 
in on it and trace 
it 
back to 
its 
cause. 
We see the effects 
of our own 
and other's  actions 
in 
Introspection but we must trace the effect back to the cause in 
order to have a real and lasting benefit. 
Q.  Did Daskalos believe that as Researchers of Truth that 
it 
was helpful, 
or 
even 
acceptable, 
to engage 
in past life regression 
the
rapy 
for 
the purpos
e of understanding 
what 
some 
of the 
issues 
or 
karma were 
that 
we brought

past life karma 
is influencing 
us in this lifetime. 
It is manifesting 
in this lifetime. 
So study 
these 
things 
in you and correct 
what 
you 
need 
to correct. 
It is definitely 
not necessary 
to know the 
particulars 
of what 
created 
these 
things 
in the past life in order 
to 
rectify 
them. 
The solution 
is the same 
where 
you know 
what 
caused 
them 
or not. 
Q. Also we are encouraged 
to "investigate 
the truth" 
and 
we are given 
the scientific 
method 
of the five Golden 
Keys 
with 
which 
to do so.  But I would 
also like to understand 
better 
what 
faith actually 
means. 
I feel this is a stumbling 
block 
for many. 
What 
is faith? 
What 
is does Daskalos 
mean by 
right 
thought? 
A.  Researching 
the truth 
for spiritual 
gain only, 
is not 
enough. 
We have our daily life to deal with. 
The Researcher 
of 
Truth 
is constantly 
asking 
and expecting 
answers 
about 
his or her 
self and everything 
around them. 
A researcher 
wants 
to have 
correct  answers, 
which 
are parallel 
to other  truths  within 
a 
harmonious 
whole 
of knowledge. 
This gives 
us sureness 
about 
things. 
Now 
the researcher 
has reached 
a point 
where 
he belie
,·es 
in something 
- and here we have 
reached 
the word 
faith. 
Now 
their belief 
or faith is based 
on his or her own direct 
knowledg
e. 
That is something 
that  no one can take away 
from  you.  Who 
can 
take it away  from  you,  now 
that you have 
gained 
real faith? 
Thi
s 
146 

i
s 
th
e 
faith that 
can move 
mountain
s 
Chr
ist Sp
oke 
abo
ut.  N
ow 
yo
u 
are 
no 
lon
ger 
ignora
nt and lacking 
in faith, 
just blow
n about 
lik
e a  leaf 
by the winds of karma. 
But having blind faith is not satisfactory to a rational 
p
erson. This is what Daskalos means by right thinking. Right 
thinking is clear reasonable thinking. Right thinking is clear, 
proceeds in a logical way to a solid conclusion. Right thinking is 
not just having thoughts turning over and over in your head 
without coming to a conclusion. Right thinking is not enslaving 
your thinking process to satisfying and serving desires - that is 
wrong thinking. 
When, 
as researcher, 
you have succeeded 
achieving 
faith 
base on real knowledge, more will be given to you.  You cannot 
have real faith if it is not based on real knowledge. Can you have 
faith in something 
unless 
you know it to be true?  So faith means 
knowledge. 
As Christ 
promised, 
we only need the faith of a 
m
ust
ard 
seed and we 
can move 
mountains. 
This 
means 
knowing 
h
ow 
to 
create elementals 
and having real 
faith 
in 
what 
you 
are 
d
oi
ng, y
ou can 
move 
mountains and do 
what 
others 
call mira

choice, are you only practicing discernment, or are you also 
changing the feeling about the situation and adjusting your 
,-ibration? \'rould this also be the case with a past event rising up 
into your consciousness? 
A. In both cases we are reprogramming our way of 
thinking, feeling and behaving. In Introspection we discover our 
mistakes in responding to circumstances and events. In doing so 
we learn where we can improve and then we visualize ourseh-es 
making a better response. 
So we are reprogramming our sub-consciousness to 
respond in a better way next time we are presented with similar 
events and circumstances. And yes we are developing 
discernment, purifying our feelings and all that raises our 
"ibrations, which is to say raises our consciousness.

So, I'll cooperate

I want

I

Now, 
see your material

From

see a ray of rosy light spreading

Chapter 7 
PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE 
The great Sufi mystic poet Rumi said: when I die I will 
so
ar 
with the angels. When I die to the angels, you cannot imagine 
what I will become. The teachings of the Researchers of Truth 
give you the understanding of what that actually means and the 
practices that will lead you in to the direct experience of what 
Rumi meant. 
As you know these teachings are called the Esoteric 
Teachings. The word, Esoteric, is from the Greek language and 
so esoteric knowledge is the knowledge that comes from within 
us.  Conversely, exoteric knowledge means knowledge we get 
from outside us, like from a school or church. You have 
probably noticed that as you concentrate, meditate and study the 
teachings something clicks and makes total sense to you. You 
have the  feeling that you always  knew it, that what you learned is 
not exactly new to you. Noticing that, you as a personality self 
may even wonder, "How is it that I already know this?" It is 
because you as Soul Individuality already  know everything. 
So we have the two points, the Soul Self and the 
personality self. Now think, when you meditate, which of these 
two is meditating? It is the self that is yet to know and the Self 
that already knows. So it is both. When the connection is made

them, the personality 
self comes to know 
something and 
o
ft
en 
feels that they 
already knew it.  When this 
happens for you 
i
t 
m
eans you 
have accessed the pre-existing 
knowledge 
within 
yo
u, 
within the Soul Self. This experience comes to 
those who 
s
in
cer
ely p
ractice Meditation and use Observation to 
see what is 
a
cru
ally 
going on in their Meditation. Meditation means 
co
ncentrating, observing and knowing. 
Now this presents a similar question: "Who is it that is 
guiding us as we transmute our personality self-awareness into our 
Soul Self Awareness?" Who makes the effon to help a small 
child learn how to walk? Of course the mother as well as the 
child makes this effort. The mother cannot teach a child to walk 
if the child does not make the effon to walk too. Similarly it is 
our personality self under the guidance of the Soul Self, so both 
must make the effort to awaken the personalit
y 
self. We are one 
Self with rwo expressions. One is  the Soul Self our true 
Individuality and the other is the personality self. 
As 
we have 
said 
before, 
for those 
not 
spiritua
lly 
aware, 
the 
p
sy
chi
cal 
body 
of their 
personality 
is an oval like 
mass 
of  formless 
p
s
ych
ical 
substance that is colored by their 
feeli
ngs. 
Our 
work is 
t
o 
s
h
ap
e it 
and 
develop 
it. 
With practice 
we give 
this 
psychical 
b
o
dy 
a 
fo
rm 
that 
is 
complete 
and 
similar 
to our 
materia
l body. 
153 

\Ve use the material 
body 
as a mold 
and sub-consciously 
shape 
the psychical 
body 
with the help of the Holy 
Spirit 
and the Log
os. 
\Ve have 
said that it is the quality 
and quantity 
of the 
elementals 
we harbor 
and express 
that determines 
the character 
of 
our personality 
and thus our earthly 
lifetime. 
Likewise 
the work 
in all the universes 
is also being 
done 
by elementals. 
Without 
elementals 
there 
would 
be no creation. 
This 
is because 
the enti
re 
material, 
psychical 
and Noetical universes 
are the materialization 
of 
the Archangel's 
elementals
.   \Ve can develop 
the skill of 
creating 
positive, 
beneficial 
elementals 
for our loved 
ones, 
ourselves, 
and those 
in need. 
This 
has nothing 
to do with fanciful 
imagination. 
This is the art of real visualization 
and form 
construction. 
Right 
now, 
everyone 
try to bring 
to your 
mind 
now, 
the 
face of someone 
you know 
very well. 
Hold 
that image 
in your 
mind. 
You know 
them 
very well but what 
happens 
when 
you 
bring 
the image 
of that person 
into your 
mind? 
It comes 
and 
then it quickly 
goes 
away, 
then 
it may come back 
briefl
y and then 
go away 
again. 
It is like this because 
your sub-consciousness 
is 
unste
ady 
and often 
in conflict. 
So it is hard 
to hold 
a steady 
visuali
zati
o
n. 
\Ve 
have 
to still the sub-consciousness 
in order 
to work 
prop
e
rlr. 
\"(;'e 
do that by silencing 
our thoughts 
and quieting 
our emo
tio
ns.

W

n
eed to calm 
down the psycho
-Noetical 
atmosphere w
ithin 
us 
be
fo
re we  try 
a Meditation 
or visualization 
exercise. 
For 
those who want to progress in this work, 
it is 
i
m
p
erative   to 
practice visualization in the 
construction of 
forms, 
a
ll 
ki
nds of forms; 
circles, triangles, spheres, pyramids, 
flames, and 
so 
on. 
As you progress you will see these forms in your 
mind's 
eye more clearly and brightly, and later you will see them even 
more real.  This is because they are real and can even be 
materialized by a skilled mystic.  However that is not our aim. 
We are only allowed to use these powers for healing.  This 
requires three things - practice, practice and more practice. 
We ourselves have to develop the skill to be of more and 
more help to people.  To do this it is absolutely vital to practice 
mastering the etheric double of your material body, which is the 
healing energy.  But that is not all; simultaneously we should 
develop the ability to really understand those we try to help.  This 
means understanding their emotions, desires and their   particular 
way of thinking. Understand the condition they are in and help 
t
h
at 
p
erson. 
But do not try 
to bring to the 
surface of 
their 
co
n
sci
ousness those things that have tortu
red 
them
. 
Ea
ch 
one 
of you is 
a full and complete 
Self-Aware Soul 
e
t
er

lly

ee 
and 
never bound.  But you   will 
eventually 
discover 
t
ha
t 
as 
the 
pers
onality itself 
you are only 
pheno
mena of matter, 
155 

desires, feelings and thoughts. As a phenomenal personality you 
are progressing in time and place. But we are something much, 
much greater than just that limited personality. Gradually we 
will 
become free of all that and mm·e on ro higher knowledge and 
mastery. The self you mistakenly belie,·e yourself to be is not 
even the entire personality self. That self cannot be relied on, 
because it is  fragile and behind it there is always a vague, ill­
defined l6nd of fear. But with effort over time that self can find 
the True  Self and then  the perishable will  become 
imperishable ... the mortal will become immortal. This is the 
assimilation of the perishable personality self with the 
imperishable Inner Self. How does this happen? Again, it will be 
achieved with practice at some point in the future. 
Unfortunately most people do not make much of an effort 
to understand themselves. So their life continues on in a habitual 
manner ... well Daskalos called it an "Idiotic  Manner."  The 
common person does not check to determine if what already 
exists in their sub-consciousness is good, bad, useful or harmful. 
So their life continues on in an unsupervised way. But those who 
have planted their feet on the path of Truth do not allow their 
wa
y 
of living to continue on in this unexamined sub conscious 
wa
y
. 
156 

A 
Researcher 
of Truth has made a promise to 
examine 
t
h
ei
r 
beh
aviors, thoughts and feelings with the daily 
practice of 
I
n
tr
os
pection and to live as the Inner Self.  The 
Researcher 
b
ec
om
es the master of the circumstances found in 
their life 
whatever they are.  This means that we can control and put our 
life circumstances in order by dissolving what is not helpful and 
good, while simultaneously replacing that with new and better 
thi
ngs. 
From the very moment you stan acting like that you are on 
your way to find the Inner Self. On this way you will come to 
realize that the self you thought you  were is nothing more than 
the entire collection of you own elementals, and that you really are 
something so much greater than the assonment of your 
elementals. Now maybe for the first time you come into 
conscious contact with your  real Self and you shift you 
identification from the living images of your desire thought and 
thought desire forms, which are the elementals residing in your 
sub-conscious mind. 
Now 
we know 
that the elementals 
sleep in our 
sub­
c
o
ns
ciousness 
but they can wake up and in an 
instant and 
rise to 
t
he 
su
rface of 
our mind. These 
may come and 
make you feel 
t
o
nu
r
ed 
and 
crush 
your personality. 
Other kinds 
may 
rise and give 
yo
u 
pl
e
asu
re.  It 
depends 
on the quality 
of your 
own elementals. 
157 

The research of the truth is the study of these conditions, 
that
's 
what Introspection is. 
The torturing elementals that rise from your sub 
consciousness and give anxiety, fear and anguish are the 
Stymphalian Birds mentioned in the fifth labor of Hercules. 
When you have thoughts or feelings that come to torment and 
disturb your peace; know these have not come to help you or 
reveal  truth. They have come only to feed on your etheric vitalit
y 
and prolong their destructive life. This is why they are likened to 
the Stymphalian birds of the Hercules myth  that fed on the flesh 
of human beings. 
We use this myth as a metaphor in our work with the 
Sytnbol of Life. We will not go deep into this work now, but 
these flesh eating birds represent a certain class of evil elementals 
born from negative emotions and unhealthy desires. In the labor 
of Hercules, he had to kill them one by one with arrows. The 
arrows represent the accurately  directed, reasonable thought 
forms applied by a Researcher of Truth, which have the ability to 
disempower these torturing thoughts and feelings. A Researcher 
of Truth must de-energize all evil elementals in their sub 
consciousness. 
So when troubling and torturous thoughts come to you, 
instead of entertaining them, apply clear and conscious thought

We must pay close attention to what lies on our life path so 
we can remove the obstacles we ourselves have placed in front of 
our feet.  We are responsible for the delay of our own progress on 
our path through life.   This means that each one of us should 
learn how to consciously project positive life affirming elementals 
and not unclean spirits, which cause pain and misery to us and 
those around us. We must energize angelic elementals of love and 
not demons of dissatisfaction, which cause problems.

this kind of situation the devilish egoism can create this disguise 
but it cannot maintain it for extended periods of time. 
As 
we start to analyze the composition of our personalit
y 
we see that about 80% of it is structure is sub conscious. Our 
emotional and thought elementals are stored in the sub conscious 
mind as imagery. These past images are really the only possession 
of the personality. We as a personality may feel that we have our 
body. But our body is not created or kept alive by our 
personality. Our body is entrusted to us by the Archangelic 
Orders who created it and are sustaining it at every moment. So it 
is not really the property of the personality. 
What about the Soul? Again the personality cannot claim 
ownership of the Soul; it is the other way around. So as a 
personality the only thing we really own are these psycho-Noetical 
images: the memories of past events and experiences found in our 
sub consciousness. So using Introspection and Observation as 
floodlights we must enter our sub consciousness mind to stud
y its 
condition. In the beginning the sub consciousness is wild and 
untamed like a jungle. Our work is to transmute it in to the 
Kingdom of the Heavens  within.  This is what true spiritual 
evolution or unfoldment is. 
Once 
a student told Daskalos, "Oh I do not want 
to 
se
e 
what is in my sub consciousness." 
160 

Daskal
os 
replied, 
"If you do not ex
a
mine 
your sub 
c
o
n
s
cio
usness 
how 
will you clean 
your 
person
a
lity so 
that it c
a
n 
b
e 
a
ssi
milated 
with the 
Inner 
Self? 
You have to 
face the re
a
lity 
wh
eth
er you are 
afraid 
or not. 
Why 
a
re you 
a
fr
ai
d?  It 
is your own 
e
g
ois
m 
that is persuading 
you that you are 
a
fraid. 
Your 
egoism 
is 
th
e 
one 
that is afraid. Come on, boldly face it and 
ackno
wledge 
was is 
right and wrong and make your decision." 
The student told Daskalos that he was following Daskalos 
advice, getting  the decision not to get angry with others no matter 
how they behaved. He had followed Daskalos suggestion to write 
down his decisions in big red letters that "nothing and no one 
can make me get angr
y 
and raise m
y 
voice." He even read 
these back to himself implanting this autosuggestion in his sub 
consciousness. But still certain circumstances would arise and he 
wou
ld get  angry. 
Daskalos 
asked 
him, 
"Then 
what 
happened 
a
fter 
you got 
a
ngry 
and shouted?" 
The 
studen
t said, 
"Well 
I remember 
my promise 
an
d then I 
g
et angry 
with 
my  self." 
"Stop 
it," 
Dask
alos said, "that 
is a game. 
Meditate 
a
g
ain 
a
n
d 
k
eep 
on  sugge
sting 
to yourself 
that this is 
the right 
course 
a
nd

h

ou will  succ

161 

The fellow did as instructed and later came back and 
happily announced: "Daskale, I did it, I really changed!" 
Daskalos said emphatically, "That is a mistake. You have 
not changed; you are you. You have changed your disposition 
only. The change is not in you but in your disposition. What you 
changed is the face of your egoism. By changing it you did not 
lose anything you have gained. You have set yourself free from 
the influence and enchantment of your egoism." 
So like this fellow, first we must study the events and 
experiences we encounter in the material world. But then later 
our studies will include the psycho-Noetical World. But if you do 
not study and understand these things in the material world how 
can you advance to higher levels and understand the meanings 
there? 
We start this line of study right where we are in the materi
al 
world. We study our behavior and reactions to people and events. 
When we do, everyone will find something in their behavior 
which not desirable or acceptable. As your start to feel your 
real 
Self, you will see that some of the behavior of the lower self, 
the 
personality, does not satisfy you. So we feel dissatisfied, but we 
have this inner need - a  real need to feel satisfied. So we ha
ve 
to 
discover 
the source of our dissatisfaction and we only need 
fi
ve 
or 
ten 
minutes a day practicing Introspection to find this 
out
.  D
o
ing 
162 

t
h
is 
p
ractice you 
can find many complaints 
and negatiyities 
in 
yo
u
r 
sub 
consciousness that must be  taken 
out of  you. 
Daily 
I
n
t
ros
pection is 
one of the most important of  the 
seven 
promises 
of 
a R
esearcher of Truth 
But here is the problem; they try to hide from us when we 
s
tar
t using 
the spotlight of Introspection. A long time 
ago I used 
to stay in the village with a friend when I came to New York City. 
He had a low rent apartment and at night when the lights were 
out the  cockroaches would come  out. If you got up and turned 
the lights on late at night, the cockroaches would scurry away. 
This is exactly how the undesirable things in the dark corners of 
our sub consciousness react. When we start to shine the spotlight 
of Introspection in to the dark corners of our sub consciousness 
these things run away.  You may mistakenly feel like you find 
nothing to correct  when you do Introspection. Yet if you observe 
carefully  enough  using the Noetical light, you will start to see 
them and at first you may feel  frightened or maybe ashamed. But 
as soon as you use the right meditative thoughts and enter your 
sub consciousness, these parasitic elementals will start to dissolve 
a
ut
om
atic
ally. 
We all have 
dark corners in our sub 
conscio
usness, 
b
u
t 
th
is 
sh
ould 
not 
frighten us, because any of 
these dark comers 
ca
n 
b
e 
lit 
up and 
become clean and useful 
again. So this 
should 
giv
e 
u
s 
c
our
age to 
shine the light into the dark 
recesses of our sub 
163 

conscious 
mind. 
We are where 
we are in life, which 
is a result 
of 
the thoughts 
and emotions 
we harbor 
and express. 
The time and 
place 
circumstances 
we find ourselves 
in on Earth  plays 
a role in 
this too. 
But as a Researcher 
of Truth 
we start with our self and 
can shine 
a light in to any dark corners 
and dissolve 
what 
is 
hidden 
there. 
Christ 
said let your 
light shine 
before 
men, 
that they might 
see your 
good 
works. 
This 
was not just a comment 
about 
charitable 
works. 
This 
was a reference 
to making 
good 
use of the 
Divine 
gifts of thought 
and word, 
which 
is the third 
promise 
of a 
Researcher 
of Truth: 
To make 
good 
use of the Divine 
Gifts 
of 
thought 
and word 
at all times, 
in all places 
and under 
all 
circumstances. 
As we advance 
each of these 
promises 
takes 
on 
deeper 
and deeper 
meaning 
for us. 
Another 
time in Cyprus 
a student 
said to Daskalos, 
"Are 
there 
only seven 
promises? 
I can 
say them 
and I am sure that I 
am already 
following 
them. 
Daskalos 
stopped 
him and 
announced 
that he had already 
said too much! 
His point 
was 
our 
understanding 
of the seven 
promises 
slowly 
deepens 
as we 
advance. 
They 
are not as simple 
as they may seem 
in the 
beginning, 
but they are not extremely 
difficult 
or unpleasant 
either. 
Your 
deepening 
understanding 
of them 
as you progress 
will make 
you happier 
and more 
satisfied. 
164 

Thi
s 
less
on 
has 
identified 
that 
our 
work 
is 
to de-energiz
e 
n
e
g
a
tive 
element
als 
and 
replace 
them 
with 
posit
ive ones
. 
So 
here 
is the 
call 
to action: 
Cast 
out 
your 
personal 
egoism 
a
n
d 
p
ractic
e 
uncondi
tional 
love 
for 
God, 
the 
people 
in 
your 
life 
a
n
d al
l human 
beings. 
Do 
that 
and 
your 
personal
ity will 
gradu
al 
app
roach 
and 
be assimilated 
with 
your 
Inner 
Self, 
which 
is the 
Perm
anent 
Personality. 
Simply 
using 
your mind 
as thought 
will 
not 
take 
you the 
full 
distance. 
You 
have 
to experience 
the 
truth 
and 
then 
live it. 
Every 
human 
being 
has 
a way, 
which 
is best 
suited 
to him 
or her, 
to find 
the 
Inner 
Self. 
So 
let yourself 
be guided 
by your 
Guardian 
Archangel 
and 
your  Spirit  Guides. 
Come 
into 
your 
inheritance 
that 
has 
been 
prepared 
for 
you 
just 
as Joshua 
promised. 

Question 
Q. 
Could you clarify why in the Exercise for Good 
Hea
lth 
the specific colors are attributed to the spheres and why they 
don't correspond to the chakra colors? 
Isn't the solar plexus chakra supposedly yellow? Or is the 
blue sphere not intended to be connected to the specific chakra? 
What does it represent then? 
A.  In the truest sense colors do not really exist. It is the 
etheric vibrations that give us the sense of color, sound and light. 
However the etheric vibrations that give us colors and sounds 
have real effects on us.  What we call blue is simply etheric 
vibrations that are picked up by our eye and registered on the 
visual cortex of our brain and then interpreted by our personality­
self as a blue color. The personality interprets the vibration as 
blue, because others have told them from birth this color is blue. 
The colors we choose to use in our visualizations are chosen 
because they create certain effects in us.  The colors we choose to 
use depend on the kind of work we are doing and the effect we 
are aiming at.  It is well known that certain vibrations of light sky 
blue colors resonate in centers of the brain and produce the 
eff
ec
t 
of calmness. White rosy light is giving us the feeling of unsel
fish 
love 
... for most people. So we use that color in the Good 
He
al
th 
visualization in our heart center. But if a person had a bad 
166 

e
l<
p
e
rie
nce 
associa
ted with 
the rosy color 
then 
their 
subconsc
io
us 
co
n
n
ecti
on 
betwee
n the bad experience 
and the 
rosy color 
would 
n
ot p
roduce a good effect.

had  the girl's

lor the 
mother 
loved 
but the child 
hated. 
So all through 
her 
ch
ildh
ood the girl was forced 
to live with a color 
she 
loathed. 
By 
the time I met her in her late 20's she had such a negative 
association with  that  color she could not tolerate having things in 
that color. There was nothing wrong with that color; there are no 
bad colors. But the negative experience of  having the mother 
dominate her  color preferences over the girl's became associated 
with  that color and  she could not stand it.  So it is not only the 
vibrations of a color that affect us it is also the way we perceive 
that 
color  and what 
we associate 
with 
it. 
Now 
when using 
colors 
to help others 
we must 
be careful 
w

colors 
we use,

the vibration

Some systems give specific colors for certain chakras - ok 
but do not take their suggestions to mean that they are fixed and 
ridge. We can and do use different  colors in the same chakra to 
produce different results. Sometimes we create a whitish blue  sun 
in our solar plexus, other times we use  a golden sun  and  still 
oth
er 
time emerald green. It depends. Most often we use the white 
rosy color for the heart center, which covers the entire chest; or 
sometimes we visualize a radiant mother of pearl color there. But 
never concentrate any color directly on the material heart or any 
organ in the body. Sometimes we use canary  yellow color for the 
head area sometimes golden color. But don't make the colors 
dense and compacted like solid paint, they should be misty 
luminous light. Don't get sruck on the new age charts that show 
the yellow color only for the solar plexus, green for the heart, blue 
for the thyroid and so on. 
A long time ago there was a gathering of spirirual teachers 
from different  religions and spirirual systems. They gathered to 
discuss the color of truth. One teacher  stepped  forward  and 
declared truth is the gold color. Then another  teacher weighe
d 
in 
saying in his spiritual linage, which was over 2500 years old, the 
color of truth is violet. But another teacher objected saying 
everyone knows truth is the pure white color. This went on unti
l 
every color in the rainbow was claimed to represent the truth. 
168 

Fin
ally 
they 
all noticed 
that 
one 
teacher had 
not 
given 
his 
o
pi
ni
on 
but 
just 
sat 
there 
quietly not 
sa)�ng 
anythin
g.  So 
they 
a
sk
ed 
him: 
"Sir, 
what 
color 
do you 
say 
the 
truth 
is?" 
He 
a
ns
w
ered:  "The truth is silent". 
Q. I read somewhere in one of the Daskalos' books that 
p
ray
er is a form of 
sending healing (or at least that is 
what I 
understood). I know that one has to have permission for healing 
trearments. So if prayer is healing, why don't we  need permission 
for 
prayer? 
A.  Firstly we are not allowed as a 
p
ersonality to interfere 
with  the  life of another human  being  without their request and 
permission; even if we believe we know what is correct and right 
to be done. But as the Inner Self, the Soul Self, we can pray, 
visualize and work for the good of others, because the Inner Soul 
Self is not in danger of interfering, dominating or making 
mis
takes. 
Even 
without 
a  person's 
direct 
request 
as  a personality 
are 
a
llo
wed to 
make 
general 
healing 
prayers 
for 
people's 
well-being 
a
n
d 
for 
them 
to be 
whole 
and 
healthy 
in body, 
heart 
and 
mind. 
Th
at 
is 
becau
se that 
effort 
is coopera
ting 
with 
the 
will 
of 
God. 
Ho
w 
do 
we 
know 
that 
is the 
will 
of  God? 
The 
proof 
is: If you 
cut 
t
h
e 
leg 
of a 
great 
saint 
or a serial 
killer 
and 
keep 
the 
wounds 
clean, 
bo
t
h 
will 
heal 
in 
about 
the 
same 
rime
_ 
\Xby? 
This 
is because; 
it is 
169 

the will of the God 
for both 
the saint 
and 
the killer 
to be whole 
and 
healthy 
if the law of karma 
permits. 
So we can cooperate 
with 
God 
in this way. 
However 
before 
as a personality 
attempt 
healing 
treatments 
for specific 
illnesses 
or diseases 
the patient 
should 
sincerely 
want 
and 
request 
help. 
It is important 
to the 
healing 
process 
itself 
that 
the personality 
of the patient 
cooperate. 
But in both 
cases 
we should 
end 
our healing 
prayers 
and 
treatments 
with 
''Thy 
Will 
Be Done" 
We can work 
very 
hard 
for 
their 
recovery 
and 
even  insist 
for a healing 
but at the end 
rum 
it 
over 
to God 
with  "Thy  Will 
Be done". 
We state 
this  because 
it is 
not  possible 
for us as a personality 
to fully 
know 
the  entire 
chain 
of causation 
of that 
illness 
or injury, 
nor the lesson  being 
taken 
by 
that 
personality. 
Remember 
Illnesses 
and 
diseases 
are there 
because 
there 
is 
a 
reason 
for that. 
These 
things 
are not happening 
outside 
of 
God's 
providence. 
The 
reason 
behind 
the illness, 
accidents 
and 
disease 
is a transgression 
of the laws 
which 
put things 
out of 
balance 
and 
harmony. 
All illness 
and 
accidents 
are caused 
by 
transgressions 
of the laws. 
But, 
sooner 
or later 
the harmony 
must 
come 
back 
in balance. 
Illness, 
accidents 
and 
disease 
res
tor
e 
the balance 
and 
harmony 
- but it does 
so the hard 
way. 
The 
Hindus 
call it "karma". 
In Greek 
it is Greema 
or Creema. 
It 
is 
t
h
e 
170 

s
a
m
e 
as 
what Christ 
said, "What a man sows, so 
he shall reap". 
O
rth
o
dox 
science is calling this action and 
reaction the law 
of 
cause  and effect. 
Keep in mind that the illness or accident does not come 
from God to punish a transgressor. On the contrary, it is  giving 
that person a precious lesson. There is no punishing God. God 
our Father is most  merciful and loving. But, when a physical, 
psychical, or Noetical law is violated - balance must be restored. 
This is the universal law of balance, order and harmony. If a 
physical, emotional or mental illness comes to a person it is 
because of their own vices and mistakes. 
It is like this: If a child throws a rock up oYer its head and it 
comes down and hits him in the head and it starts bleeding. His 
injury is not a punishment form  God. It does him no good to 
bla
me God 
or 
complain 
to God 
for his  lack 
of 
understan
ding 
of 
the  law of Gravity. It  does no good for him  to ask God  to 
re
mov
e the law 
of Gravity 
so he will  not  get hurt 
when 
he throws 
t
h
e 
ro
ck 
over 
his head. 
He must 
come 
to 
understa
nd the 
law of 
Gr
av ity 
and 
not thro
w stones 
over 
his own 
head. 
He must learn 
c
o
o
p
era
te 
the laws 
gover
ning 
his physica
l realit
y 
and then 
he 
will

i
nju
ry

throwing 
stones 
up in 
the air. 
Similarl
y if

s 
or 
disea
se 
comes 
to us 
it does 
no 
good 
to 
blam
e God 
or 
171 

ask him to change his laws. We must come to learn the laws 
gm·erning the reality we find ourselves in and not transgress the 
laws with our unenlightened behaviors, feelings and thoughts. 
To help someone suffering from physical, emotional or 
mental aliment, the first thing we must do as psychotherapist is to 
help that fellow by our love. Then with psychoanalysis we try to 
make those conditions which will relieve that personality from its 
guilt or from its faults - so that the Holy Spirit may make the cure 
through the etheric double of the psychotherapist. 
Now let's talk about the part of the question concerning 
prayer. What is prayer? Is it just reciting words and in your mind 
being someplace else thinking of other things? Or is prayer just 
going to a church or temple and kneeling down to recite words of 
prayer that have been taught to us?  Using this time just to recite 
memorized words, and all the while subconsciously thinking of 
thousands of other things? This is not prayer. 
What can a prayer really be
> 
Prayer is a true method of 
Meditation. Approaching your  real  self and approaching God 
inwardly. But just whispering words mechanically and thinking 
many, many other things at the time you are just reciting 
word
s? 
These are not prayers. As researchers we haYe another better 
172 

me
th
o
d we 
call the 
concentric 
prayer, 
which 
is 
concentr
ation 
and 
M
e
di
tat
ion. A M
editation 
is a prayer. 
Prayer in reality, 
in order 
to 
b
e 
eff
ective, 
should be real  Meditation 
and real 
concent
ration. 
Shoul
d we 
pray? 
\11i'hy 
should 
we pray? 
\11i'hy 
would 
God 
th
e A
bsolute 
Infinite 
Selfhood 
who is completely 
Self-Suffic
ient 
n
eed 
our prayers? 
Of 
course 
God does not need our 
prayers 
but 
we are very  much in need of pra;ing to God in order attune, 
approach and know Him. Yes we should pray - but does it 
matter where we pray? In which church should we pray? We 
should pray in the church of our own  hean. Everybody should 
make his or her hean the Holy of the Hollies, and enter there to 
make their prayers. 
But what kind of prayer do people make? i.; sually people 
are asking for something
.  That is ok. Christ has allowed it. He 
said, "Ask and it shall be given, seek and you will find, knock and 
the door will be opened". This is a great truth - It is a promise 
from  God that we can rely on.  But we must also consider the 
quality of our prayers. \11i'hat do we pray for? Is it ok just to pray 
for the  satisfaction of unreasonable and unbridled desires or 
e
mo
tio
n
s? 
The
se 
prayers will not be answer
ed, any more 
than the 
P
r
a
y
er
s 
of a 
small 
boy who wants a real 
fire truck 
or a real 
a
ir
p
l
a
ne. 

So what do you think a prayer is?  For sure every prayer 
will express the thoughts, the emotions, and the desires of the 
person praying. Every prayer creates an elemental - an emotion 
and thought-form, which is a kind of living existence. Prayers 
to 
a saint, to Christ as they imagined him from seeing paintings and 
statues or to the Hindu God Shiva, or to Allah or any deity usually 
has the form of the deity or the person they are directed to.  This 
prayer-born  elemental has its own intelligence and a certain 
quality. Prayers are a certain class of elementals. Real prayers are 
creating angelic elementals, constructive elementals; such as 
prayers for the health of others, helping our fellow human beings. 

Meditation 
Befor
e we do 
this Meditation 
exercise 
let's say 
someth
ing 
g
en
eral 
about how to 
do these exercises 
on our 
own.  It is 
difficult 
to 
try 
to 
rememb
er these mediations 
in their entirety 
at first.  So 
u
n
til 
you 
memorize 
them, you may want to record them 
and play 
th
e r ecor
ding back as you go through 
the exercise. 
Or you can 
ask 
someone else to read it to you as you practice. 
One of the most important things is to get into a 
comfortable position. Your back should be held straight but 
without any tension. Place your left hand on your left knee or 
thigh and your right hand on your right knee or thigh. Your palms 
can be upward.  Another important requirement is to seal off the 
thoughts, feelings and desires that tend to surface from your 
subconscious mind once you start to meditate. This is an initial 
step to mastering your mind. 
Now 
we start comfortable, 
rhythmical, 
consciou
s 
b
rea

more consciously 
we breathe 
the 
more etheric 
v
ita
lity 
we are 
gaining. 
We breathe 
in for four 
beats of the 
heart

\X'e breathe like 
this 
for

foundat
ion. 
Take a 
mo
m
ent 
and do this a few times and 
then 
start. 
Cl
ose 
your 
eyes. Relax completely
. Start 
from the feet. 
C
o
m
p
let
e 
relax
ati
on. Feel the feet. Feel the 
lower part of 
the feet; 
175 

move upward and feel the knees; Feel the thighs. Now feel 
relaxed in the belly. Feel relaxed in the chest, in the head. Feel 
y
ou 
are in all your body. 
Now begin this line of contemplation: You are living in 
your material body; the holy Archangels working in your material 
body know it well. They feel you. Also God in  His Omnipresence 
is there, in your bodies also: With you, with your personality. 
Whatever you ask God, He is ready to give you anything 
material. But we will ask Him also to lead us, while being in 
temptation, and to deliver us from evil. 
Joshua said that in Greek and in Aramaic: lead us while 
being in temptation and deliver us from evil. Being tempted is a 
test, but being in temptation, under the influence of temptation is 
more of a trial. 
Check now to see the quality of your desires, of your 
emotions and of your weaknesses such as fear. Fear leads to 
anger, anger leads to hatred. It does not even mater if you think 
you are right,  because the other person has done  wrong to you. 
Hatred is poison in your bodies. For your  sake, for the sake of 
the 
health of your bodies, take out of your  mind  all negative 
elementals. Anger and hatred are deadly toxins to the material 
body. 

Eve
n comp
laints 
are to be avoided, 
because 
"at the root of 
th
e 
tree of 
complai
nts is coiled 
the serpent 
of 
hatred." 
This is 
w

at 
the 
Buddha

So harbor 
no complaints 
against 
anyone 
and 
live free! 
Next time our lesson will be about the Law of Destiny and 
how this law comes to restore balance and harmony. We will 
speak about the so-called Dark Night of the Soul, the First 
Crucifixion and the role physical, emotional and mental pain 
serves in our restoration. 

Chapter 8 
THE LAW OF DESTINY 
As personalities living in the worlds of illusion, we 
sometimes become unbalanced. The restoration of this balan
ce 
comes through a degree of pain and  ordeals proportional to the 
unbalance. Obviously no one  wants to feel  pain and no one 
should want to give pain to others. Yet it is said: "Blessed be the 
pain that comes from paying our debts". 
Some of you may have alresdy had experiences with what 
the Spanish Mystic, Saint John of the Cross, called the  Dark Night 
of the Soul. This is an extraordinary difficult phase of our 
spiritual journey. 
John said: "God takes us into a dark night. He weans us 
from all pleasures by giving us dry time and inward darkness. 
Through the dark night pride becomes humility, greed becomes 
simplicity, wrath becomes contentment, luxury becomes peace, 
and gluttony becomes moderation. No Soul will ever grow deep 
in the spiritual life unless God works passively in that Soul by 
means of the Dark Night". 
John points out three elements of this Dark Night. One 
has to do with your desires. You will notice that when you 
undergo periods of spiritual darkness, fear and depression your 
desires start to change. Your priorities and paradi
gm
s begin to

J
ohn 
warns you may lose your desires and 
motivations of 
yo
u
r 
n
ormal life 
completely for a time. Even 
more 
alarming you 
ca
n 
l
ose 
your desire for your spiritual practice. Prev
iously, your 
sp
iri
tual 
practice nourished and energized you. But 
during the 
Da
rk 
Night  of  the  Soul  even your spiritual practice 
can become 
diffi
cult and unsatisfying. In  fact you may not  be able 
to  find 
any
thing that brings you satisfaction during this phase. 
A second element that John warns us about is regressing. 
Sometimes we feel we are relapsing, backsliding, and losing 
spiritual ground. This can  give great concern to the sincere 
seeker. Yet this experience may give us a valuable insight that  we 
are  not as  in control of  our life as  we thought we were.  But do 
not  worry; sincere concern over backsliding and  sincere desire not 
to  is  evidence that you are not really backsliding. 
The third element mentioned by John of the Cross is 
discursive Meditation that uses the  mental faculties of reason. 
During the Dark  Night  of the Soul these kinds of Meditations can 
b
eco
me 
unbearably 
difficult and we may find it hard 
to  even think 
s
tr

Remember the Soul in its true nature never suffers, feels 
no 
pain and is never in darkness. However the personality that 
for
ms 
on the Ray of the Soul does experience pain and suffering duri
ng 
incarnation. It undergoes the phenomenon of darkness. This 
darkness is really an eclipse of the Soul's Divine Nature and not a 
darkening of the Soul itself. If you are outside on a sunny day and 
a storm moves in, the clouds will obscure the sun. Nothing has 
happened to the sun. But now there is a phenomenon  called 
clouds that prevent you from seeing the sun and receiving its 
warmth. In a similar way this is what happens to our personality 
in the experience called the Dark Night of the Soul or call it the 
first crucifixion. 
During such spiritual crisis as the Dark Night it is especially 
important for us to Love as deeply as possible, forgive those who 
make you suffer and avoid giving pain to others. By this action 
our pain is reduced and eventually dissolves. 
Often people wonder why pain even exists in God's 
Kingdom. Pain is beneficial but it is never given to us as a 
punishment from God. When we go too far astray, the whip of 
destiny or call it the law of Karma comes in to action to bring us 
back 
to our senses. This does eventually produce desirable 
resu
lts 
but 
this is a hard and bloody way to go. How long will we 
su
ffer 
like 
this? As long as we refuse to go by the way of reason 
to 
se
e 
180 

th
e 
true 
reality, we will suffer the Whip 
of Desti
ny.  T
his 
means 
t
h
at 
rea
son is the 
way of overcoming 
this kind 
of pain 
through 
Me
dit
ation and 
Observation.  So we have two ways 
to 
progress: 
r
ea
son 
or suffering. 
We cannot opt out of 
progressing in 
life. 
Eve
n if we 
do not want to progress 
we will because 
it is our 
na
ture and part of the Divine Plan. 
Some people, even when they are admittedly in great 
confusion and miserably suffering do not want to come out of it. 
That is due to the masochistic facet of their egoism.  Sometimes 
egoism likes to suffer, play the victim and feel miserable because it 
thinks suffering validates its illusionary existence. 
In a Stoa Lesson someone asked Daskalos "Is it possible to 
get out of this kind of suffering"? He said: "Yes, you can come 
out anytime you want to.  It is easy once you come to the decision 
to come out.  To come to that decision you have to use reason 
instead of just following the stupid torturing emotions. So there is 
no excuse". 
No 
God or 
Archangel 
is forcing us to stay in 
a hellish 
co
n
dition as 
a punish
ment.  But if we stubbornly 
violate the Laws 
o
f B
alan
ce and 
Harmo
ny, we will be brought 
back in balance 
by 
t
h
e 
la
w of 
Cause and 
Effect - Karma.  This 
world 
and all the 
Wo
rl
ds 
beyond are 
perfectly 
governed 
by  Laws, 
Causes 
and 
181 

Principles. When we violate these laws we face the results or 
consequences, but again not as punishments. 
Illness is unnatural, perfect health is natural. But in every 
incarnation our personality has created certain causes, which are 
violations of the order of things. So all this has to be balanced 
and made right. Thus we have accidents, physical illnesses, as well 
as mental and emotional  suffering. So we as present-day 
personalities are the ones causing our own suffering and illness br 
the way we are living. The Seeker of Truth must study all this and 
decide what truth is and what illusion is. 
The Seeker of Truth chooses the right way and helps others 
to follow the right way. Christ said I am the way and he who 
would follow me must shoulder his own cross, his own burdens 
in life, and follow his example. His way is the reasonable way of 
love, wisdom, strength and forgiveness. The other way is karmic; 
whatever we are doing to others so shall it be done to us.  If you 
want to be forgiven for your mistakes, forgive the mistakes of 
others. 
If we violate 
a material 
law of graviry 
by stepping 
off the 
roof 
of a building, 
we will have 
an immediate 
effect 
of that 
violation. 
Call 
it instant 
karma. 
If we violate 
the psychical 
law
s 
governing 
our psychical 
body 
or the Noetical 
laws 
governin
g 
out 
Noetical 
body 
we get an unavoidable 
conse
q
uence 
for   this 
k
i
n
d of 
182 

vi
o
l
ation 
too.  It may not be as fast of a result as 
stepping off 
of a 
r
o
of, 
but 
nonetheless the result will be just as 
inescap
able. 
We 
are all exactly 
in the place where 
de
s
tiny 
put us. 
We do 
n
o
t 
have to abandon 
worldly 
life and 
relationship
s to 
advance 
sp
i
ritu
ally.  No need to abandon 
good things 
but we 
do need to 
fre
e 
ourselves from  the 
intoxicating 
attachments 
to 
these things. 
Th
at is the point. 
There is no other way but to become 
the 
master of our desires, attachments, thoughts and emotions, which 
is to say that we will   become masters of our own destiny. In 
becoming masters of our destiny, we will find our real Self. 
Once Christ was giving instructions to his disciples and 
speaking about the so-called End of Times. This means the end 
of time when God gathers the personalities of all people within 
His Logoic Self.  This is sometimes called the Jud
gm
ent Day.  But 
really every day is a jud
gm
ent day. 
He 
gave them 
a parable about a king at the end of 
times. 
Ch
rist 
did not say the king in the parable 
was 
an earthly 
king.  So 
o
f c
ourse the 
king in the 
parable 
is Christ.  In 
Aramaic the 
people 
i
n h
is 
time were 
calling 
Him:  'Melekh 
Shamayy
im', 
which 
means 
th
e 
king of the heavens. 
No
w 
Chri
st 
began 
his parable 
with: "When the 
Son of   M
a
n 
c
o
m
es 
in his 
glory he 
will gather all the 
n
a
tion
s 
a
nd he 
shall 
s
e
p
ar
at
e 
them 
one from 
the other as a 
sheph
erd sep
ara
tes 
the 
183 

sheep from the goats. He shall put the sheep on his right and 
t
he 
goats on the left. 
Now think of the symbolism: the sheep are gentle and 
cooperative whereas goats can be stubborn and uncooperative. 
He continued: "Then shall the King say unto them on His 
right, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the Kingdom 
prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 
For I was hungry and you gave me food. 
I was thirsty and you gave me drink. 
I was a stranger and you welcomed me. 
I was naked and you clothed me. 
I was a prisoner and you visited me. 
I was sick and you came to me. 
They will answer: 'Lord when did we do this for you'? 
The King will reply: 'whoever does this to the least of my 
brethren, he does it to me'. 
''Then shall the King say unto them on his left hand, 
'Depart from me you cursed ones."' 
But Christ is not the one who cursed this group. They 
were cursed by their own belief that they are separate from 
everyone around them and not required to care for others. 
The 
King will say to them: 'I was hungry and you gave 
me 
nothing to eat, 
184 

I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to  drink, 
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, 
I needed  clothes and you did not clothe me, 
I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' 
They too will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry 
or 
thirsty 
or a stranger 
or needing 
clothes 
or sick or in 
prison, 
and 
did 
not help 
you'? 
"He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do 
for the  least of my brethren, you did not do for me.' 
"Then they will  go away to everlasting torment, but the 
righteous to eternal life." 
Here Christ is speaking about the Common Selfhood of all 
of humanity. So when Christ was saying I was hungry and I was 
thirsty, the "I" means evety human being. Wbatever we do to 
other human beings we are doing to him and to ourselves as well. 
Because he is in us as God and he is with us as the Christ in every 
other human being. So, keep this in your mind that whatever one 
is 
doin
g to 
another human 
being, good or ev
i
l, he is 
doing it to 
Go
d. 
Anot
her 
point: 
when he 
said the blessed 
ones 
will enjoy 
e
te
r
nal 
Life 
and 
the cursed 
ones 
everl
astin
g torm
ent 
what did 
he 
me
a
n? 
God 
does 
not  torment 
and the consequ
ences 
of our bad 
a
ct
io
ns are 
not everlasting. 
Any 
effec
t resul
ting 
from 
the 
185 

unbalancing 
of the Universal 
Laws is always 
in exact proportion 
to the cause that created 
the unbalance. 
This eternal 
principle 
is 
also stated in Einstein's 
theory 
of relativity 
and Newton's 
third 
law of motion, 
which 
states: 
"For every action 
there is an equal 
and opposite 
reaction" 
In other words, 
all effects 
material 
or 
spiritual 
cannot 
be greater 
than the cause of that effect. 
So the 
ridiculous 
idea that God would 
inflict everlasting 
torment 
on 
someone 
who violated 
laws during 
an earthy incarnation 
of less 
than 100 years is so blasphemous 
that it simply 
cannot 
be taken 
seriously. 
This false notion 
presents 
God as unloving 
and cruel 
when God is absolutely 
loving 
and merciful. 
So what is the everlasting 
torment? 
Everlasting 
torment 
is 
a reference 
to incarnation 
in the worlds 
of existence 
where there is 
always 
some degree 
of suffering 
and torment 
at some level going 
on.  This was also the Buddha's 
first noble truth: 
"All life is 
suffering". 
All life suffers 
at least to some degree 
at some time 
But Christ 
also said the blessed 
ones go to eternal 
Life, 
which means 
they return 
to their Divine 
Nature, 
which 
is Life 
itself - Life eternal. 
Christ once said:  "In this world you will have tribula
tion 
and 
sorrow". 
He had sorrow 
and tribulation 
as a human 
bein
g 
in 
this 
world too.  Sorrow 
is nothing 
more than emotion
al 
pain, 
psychical 
pain.  The 
condition 
of pain is found 
only in 
the w
o
rld
s 
186 

o
f 
ex
istence 
up through 
the lower Noetical 
world.  Bu
t pains do 
s
erv
e 
us. 
They serve in the development 
of our 
perso
nality by 
h
elp
ing raise 
our 
personality's 
awareness 
to that of 
the real Soul­
Self 
Awareness. 
He said: "In this world you will have tribulation and 
sorrow, but take courage, I have overcome the world". By 
overcoming the world he overcame the sorrow of this world. 
Li,�ng in this world we all live with bodily pain and the conditions 
of emotional sorrow and mental suffering -at least to some 
degree. Notice he did not say he fixed or eliminated the sorrow 
of this world but overcame it.  This is a clue for us when dealing 
with our sorrow. 
As the world sa�or, Christ helps shoulder the sorrow or 
cross 
of all human 
beings in the worlds of existence. 
Think 
about 
this. 
He carries the cross of the worlds of existence. 
Maybe we 
c
an 
say he carries 
90 percent 
of the weight of our own 
cross, the 
ot
her 
ten percent 
we 
must carry. 
This is related 
to the 
Law of 
De
stin
y.  The 
Law of Destiny 
is the law of cause 
and 
effect, the 
Kar
mic 
Law. 
Again the undesirable 
conseq
uences 
we reap 
from 
o
u
r 
a
ctio
ns are not 
punishments 
but a 
necessary 
experi
ence 
l
e
adin
g us towards perfection. 
W
e all 
kno
w if 
we do something 
really good 
to another 
.  . 
1 ter  That is the Law of 
pe
r
so
n 
we can 
feel JOY 
1n 
that mom
ent 
or 
a 
187 



Destiny. 
Com·ersely 
if we do something 
really bad to another 
person, 
either intentionally 
or unintentionally, 
we will face the 
effect of those actions 
in this life or in a future incarnation. 
That 
is the  Law 
of Destiny. 
The purpose 
of this aspect of the law 
is 
the purification 
of our personality. 
Now here is a paradox. 
We have all seen situations 
where 
sometimes 
someone wants 
to do well but later 
it 
turns out 
that 
it 
was wrong and not good in that particular 
situation. 
The road 
to 
hell is paved with  good 
intentions 
as the old 
saying goes.  Similarly 
we can observe that sometimes someone 
will 
attempt to do 
something 
bad and yet it turns out to produce 
some good. 
Sometimes 
a person's 
negative emotions 
reach a point of 
detesting 
and they have the desire to take revenge. 
One  time 
a 
fellow had come to a few of Daskalos 
Stoa Lessons 
and then 
spoke with him privately. 
He said to Daskalos: 
"Now, I ha,·e 
attended 
certain lessons. 
You were saying that we shouldn't 
hate, 
we 
should love our fellow human 
beings. 
That's all good. Yes, I 
a
pprove 
that, but look here; I shall be good after taking revenge 
against 
a person 
who did me much harm". 
Daskalos 
told him that person 
didn't cause him that much 
harm.  And in fact he had done himself 
more harm by listening 
to 
his own egoism's 
reaction 
to what was done.  But the fellow 
188 
o
bj
ec
ted 
saying that 
the person had o
ff
ended him 
and said 
hurt
fu
l 
w
o
r
ds. 
Dask
aios 
told him: "If you didn't listen to 
his words 
then 
t
h
eY 
would 
not  have  done 
any harm.  You 
are 
harming yours
elf b,­
Iis
tening to these hurtful 
words"
. 
The fellow said: "Alright 
I will admit what you call the 
tr
uth but I will become 
good after taking 
my re,·enge". 
Daskalos 
started 
laughing 
and said:  "Yes you can take your 
revenge 
but you will find out a great truth if you do". 
The fellow complained 
saying: 
"Oh don't tell me that. 
will 
take my revenge and then come to you". 
"Ok", Daskalos 
replied, 
"Take your reYenge 
but in   the end 
you 
will 
not have any success". 
So 
the fellow made his plan, took his reYenge 
and then 
retur
ned to 
Daskalos 
saying: 
"I took mY reYenge, 
now I will 
be 
good". 
Then 
Daskalos delivered 
the power of this lesson 
to him 
say�
ng: 
"What 
you have done 
to that person, 
made him wiser. 
You 
have not done 
damage 
to him as mu 
think you 
did. 
Instead 
you 
woke him 
up.  You just 
succeede
d doing the 
o
p
p
osite of 
what 
you wanted 
to do.  Revenge 
is a very sweet 
fruit 
h  . 
. 
b. 
digest  Now digest the 
t 
at 
IS 
en1oyable 
to taste, but very 
Jtter to 
189 

fruit of  revenge more peacefully knowing that you have not do
ne 
much harm to him. You have done some good to this person". 
Fortunately this fellow understood Daskalos' point and 
evenrually admitted: "Yes, you were right. The fruit of revenge is 
ver
y 
bad in the digestion". 
What makes us most responsible in terms of the Law of 
Destiny is our intention. We have all heard  actions  speak louder 
than words. But in truth our motivation speaks even louder than 
our actions. Yet it  is our intention that speaks loudest of all. In 
the case of this revengeful  fellow he did some good, 
unintentionally; but the bad he intentionally wanted to do to the 
other man, he acrually did to himself. Human beings must offset 
their bad thoughts,  wishes and actions  even  though they may ha\"e 
rurned out good. The importance is more on the intention than 
the action. 
So someone can do a bad thing intentionally or 
unintentionally and even believing that it is good. That action was 
supposed to go to another person who may have to face it 
because of the Law of Destiny governing their  life. Se we see 
that 
a person doing bad can also be instrumental in fulfilling the 
Divine plan. 
It is the will of God that is the Law of Destiny, which is 
exact and perfectly just. It is the law that keeps matter in 
190 

c
o
h
ere
nce 
and 
the 
universes 
in harmony. 
No one, 
saint or sinner, 
ca
n 
dist
urb 
this law 
without 
reaping 
a conseque
ntial experien
ce  in 
p
ro
p
ortion to 
the 
disturbance 
they created. 
This Law of 
Destiny 
o
r 
c
all it the 
Law of Balance 
and Order is in effect 
through
out all 
the universes. 
When this law is disturbed at any le.-el we have to have 
restoration. When balance is restored to a material body some 
pain is associated with the restoration. \X·ben balance is being 
restored to the psychical body, which is the seat of your 
personality's awareness, we experience sorrow. Again this serves 
the purification and development of our personality. 
In our Noetical body we have  something corresponding to 
sorrow too, which is associated with knowledge of our 
transgression. This can give sorrow to our psychical body, the 
body of our emotions. But if someone does something bad, right 
thi
nking tends to 
come afterwards 
with the intenti
o
n of 
c
o
rrecting 
th
e bad. 
Then they may feel 
the reward 
of j
o
y for 
o
verc
o
ming 
the 
b
ad 
with 
good. 
Just like 
with the bad, the j
o
y and reward 
o
f their 
g
o
od is propo
rtional 
to what they th
o
ught, 
wished 
and 
did. 
So 
there is pain in 
the material 
b
o
dy, 
s
o
rrow in 
o
ur 
p
sy
chi
cal 
body and 
reparation 
in our 
N
o
etical 
b
od
y.  With 
m
o
re 
ma
t
ure 
think
ing, 
reason 
and restiruti
o
n, we 
bec
o
me g
ood 
e
v
alu
ators of 
our personality 
self and 
its 
behavi
o
rs. 
191 

As Daskalos has said: "No one is imposing sorrow on us, 
our sorrow comes from being unreasonable". Any sorrow 
enacted upon us comes from our own Inner Self, as it tries to 
bring the personality self to reason and a change for the better. 
We can see this in the story about the two robbers who were 
crucified alongside of Christ.  One robber felt pain and great 
sorrow for his crimes, thus as a present day personality he was 
using reason and repented. But the other robber responded to his 
suffering in rage and mocked Christ.  So the first robber said to 
the second robber: "We justly receive the due reward of our 
deeds: but this man, Christ, has done nothing wrong". 
Maybe the first robber had heard Christ's teachings on the 
kingdom of the heavens and he asked Christ: "Remember me 
when you come into your kingdom". That robber repented his 
actions and believed in Christ.  Immediately within this robber the 
psychical and Noetical balance was restored. Christ said to him: 
"Today you will be in paradise with me". 
Theologians have wondered how that a robber on a cross 
could enter the Kingdom of the  Heavens within an instant.  They 
imagined it would re<Juire years and years of penance before such 
a sinner would be allowed in Heaven. But it is not a matter of 
time 
it is a matter of reaching the right state of heart and 
mind 
to 
enter the Kingdom of the  Heavens. 
192 

Wheth
er we understand 
it or not, life leads 
us slowly 
to a 
re
w
ard. 
Ever
yone will receive 
their reward 
accordin
g to 
their way 
o
f 
life, 
their thoughts 
and the wishes of their 
heart -
good or 
bad. 
Und
erstand 
that although 
the Law of 
Destiny 
is 
in
esca
pable, it is not totally 
fixed.  It is not cast 
in 
stone 
and 
i
mm
ovable. 
The Law of Destiny 
will affect each 
person 
dif
ferently.  It depends 
on each person's unique 
psycho
-Noetical 
co
ndition, 
which means 
the conditions 
of their 
emotion
s and 
thoughts. So the playing out of the law must be examined 
separately for each person. 
Sorrow, pain, experience and knowledge - all these must 
come together so there can be a balancing of the law.  If we see a 
person behaving foolish and overdoing a destructive behavior, the 
result can be illness, which makes them suffer and feel pain.  Yet 
they may still continue to behave in this way.  They do not 
connect the result of their illness with the cause, which are their 
own unhealthy behaviors. 
Someti
mes a person's 
illness makes them 
angry and they 
may 
bla
me God, 
their doctor 
and sometimes 
even their 
friends 
an
d 
fa
mily.  So 
the pain continues. 
But instead 
of 
dealing 
with 
t
h
e
ir 
pain 
with di
gnity, they can react to it 
with 
rage or fall 
into 
de
sp
air. 
But 
these 
reaction
s do not alter 
the Law 
of Destiny in 
193 

the least; it actually makes the situation much worse and the 
suffering continues. 
God is most merciful and can send visible helpers as well 
as 
invisible helpers to a suffering person at any moment in order to 
comfort and shine a light on the right way for them. So no matter 
how great the suffering may be, help and opportunities are 
available.  Absolute  Beingness, God, is in us and all around us and 
knows everything that is happening to us and exactly what we 
need. 
The merciful God is always with us.  When we are in 
physical pain, we are fortunate to live in a time where we can go 
to a doctor and get medicine to reduce the pain. When we are in 
great sorrow, an Angel is sent in the form of a loved one, friend 
or spouse to comfort us.  Or an invisible helper is sent to be with 
us during our suffering to help us find our way through it.  This is 
the love of God, and that love is full and present even in the 
darkest hells. 
It is said that God is closer to those Souls in the dark hells 
that those Souls in the luminous paradises. Those in the paradi
ses 
can rise up and come nearer to God by their own effort. But 
God 
and his emissaries must go to those  "lost ones"  that are in the 
conditional hells. The so-called lost ones are not just living on 
earth. 
There are also these temporary lost ones who have 
pass
ed 
194 

o
ve
r and 
find 
themselv
es in their 
personal 
s
hell hell 
in the 
P
sychical World. 
We 
must 
study 
well and come 
to a clear 
under
s
tanding 
of 
th
e 
condi
tions 
that 
are associated 
with living 
in the 
world
s 
of 
ex
isten
ce.  This 
means 
knowing 
how the Law of 
De
s
tiny 
works 
a
nd 
what 
happens 
when 
that law is di
s
turbed. 
Then 
we will be 
hu
mbled 
and amazed 
by  the love and  wisdom 
of 
God, 
in  the 
suffering itself, as a most  needed and  valuable experience. 
Instead of learning about the Law of Destiny and 
cooperating with it, many go the hard way and get the lesson 
through the whip of destiny as Daskalos called it.  But we do not 
have to, there is another way. So before acting blindly, use the 
Mind as reason to conceive, to meditate in order to foresee the 
consequences we may face from our actions if we do them. We 
do 
not need 
go through 
life blindly 
by trial and error 
or wait 
for 
tragi
c consequences 
from 
an unwise 
action 
to shake 
u
s 
up in 
o
rder 
to learn 
our 
lessons. 
We can and should 
use 
our mind 
to 
fore
see likely 
outco
mes of our actions 
in 
advanc
e and 
thereby 
p
revent needless 
suffering. 
We 
can 
also 
help our loved 
ones 
to 
understan
d this more 
r
e
a
so
nable 
way of 
life.  The Holy 
Spirit 
empow
ered every 
human 
be
ing 
with 
the 
Mind 
and ability 
to reason. 
So it is up 
to us, we 
ha
v
e 
to le
arn 
to use 
these 
Divine gi
fts  in 
better 
and 
better 
way
s
. 
195 

This means right thinking - thinking rightly before we speak or 
act. 
We should not misuse or forget to use our gifts and 
become a victim of desires and illusions. In the worlds of 
existence often the most pleasurable things can lead to sorrow, 
pain and even death of the material body. So again, a main 
purpose of the Law of Destiny is to teach our personality to make 
good use of the Divine gifts of thought and word at all time and 
in all places. This is the third promise of a Researcher of Truth 

Question 
Q. 
How 
does 
visualization 
progress? 
Does 
it  evolved 
to 
th
e 
poin
t of 
being 
able 
ro see 
clearly 
in your 
mind's 
eye 
the 
object 
of 
your 
visualization? 
My 
other 
question 
is on 
the 
experience 
of "self-awa
reness," 
a
s it 
seems 
to be 
an important 
development 
of  the 
practice
s of 
con
centration 
and 
Obser
v
ation. 
I understand 
that 
the 
higher 
level 
of 
awareness, 
or self-awareness 
should 
be  continuous 
and 
then 
this 
is  where 
I  can't 
understand 
how 
that 
is even  possible. 
A. 
\X'hat 
I will 
describe 
are 
experiences 
I  have 
had 
in this 
regard 
but 
really 
they 
are 
also 
ever
yone's 
experience 
that 
does 
this 
work. 
Wben 
we 
initially 
start 
our 
visualization 
exercises, 
many 
people 
say 
they 
see 
nothing 
and 
feel 
they 
are 
alone 
in the 
dark. 
They 
will 
tell 
you 
they 
simply 
cannot 
visualize. 
But 
if you 
ask 
them 
about 
some 
material 
thing 
they 
ha,-e 
ardently 
wanted 
like 
a 
car, 
when 
they 
think 
of that 
they 
can 
see 
it in  their 
mind's 
eye 
just 
fine. 
Or 
if you 
ask 
them 
what 
is in their 
living 
room 
of their 
h
ouse
,  they 
usually 
can 
bring 
these 
images 
to their 
mind 
withou
t 
a
ny 
trouble. 
Most 
can 
visualize 
the 
objects 
of 
their 
strong 
desires, 
a
n
d 
they 
can 
recall 
the 
images 
of their 
home 
and 
see 
them 
but 
this 
is 
done 
mostly 
sub-consciously 
at 
first. 
So 
wit
h 
visu
alizatio
n we 
are 
developing 
this 
latent 
ability 
a
n
d 
mak
ing 
it 
con
sciou
s.  Still 
in  the 
beginn
ing 
we 
feel 
like we 
are 
1

imagining the images and colors because - we are. There is 
nothing wrong with imagination unless we let it degrade into 
fantasy. On our spirirual journey it is better to have a good 
imagination than to be intellectually smart. 
So we start off imagining, visualizing the objects and colors 
of an exercise. As we get our visualization more and more 
perfect, something new happens. The colors and correctness of 
the images click and lock into the archetype and you see it clearly 
and perfectly. For example, if you try to visualize a five-pointed 
star in radiant violet light, maybe the color is dull and the form of 
the star misshapen and the image unsteady. So you must use 
concentration and Observation to get your visualization clearer 
and more accurate and steady. To do this you have to become 
more clear and steady in the mediation. As you do this, you will 
evenrually come to notice the image significantly shifts towards 
the perfect Noetic archetype of it. 
I am not sure 
if I am explaining 
this 
well, 
but something 
happens 
and 
your 
visualization 
becomes 
unwavering, 
clear 
and 
correct. 
Now 
you

this over time you will

visu

Visualization 
means 
having; 
both in 
this world 
and 
the worlds beyond. 
As you continue this practice consciously, something else 
starts to dawn on you.  You start to notice  there are three things 
going on.  You discover that you as a self are using the Mind to 
visualize these images. So there is the image, the Mind used to 
visualize the image and you, a self,  doing the visualization work. 
Now this is an opportune moment, to discover that mysterious 
self of yours that can do all these things. \'v'ho is that self that 
uses the Mind to visualize images? 
So in using the etheric vitality as imprinting ether for 
visualization, or aesthetic ether for feeling, or kinetic ether for 
moving, there is always a self-awareness doing this work.  That 
self-awar
eness, as a 
personality, 
maybe 
starts doing these 
practices 
semi-
consciously 
and gradually 
become 
consciousl
y and 
then 
m
ore and more 
consciousl
y all the way to full Self 
Conscious. 
This 
means 
visualizin
g as a Self-Realized 
individual, 
which is 
i
n
cre
dibly 
more 
powerful 
and effective. 
All our 
practices 
develop 
o
ur 
per
sonal
ity's 
self-awa
reness slowly and 
steadily until it 
reaches 
t
hat 
Soul-Self Awareness. 
As a 
perso
nality our attention 
tends to 
jump 
from 
one 
s
u
bj
ect 
to  anoth
er continuously. 
It 
does 
this 
mostly 
sub-
199 

consciously. But our Soul-Self Awareness is always firm and 
steady. It is in a constant unbroken Meditation all the time.  It is 
that steady point within you.  So as a personality continuous 
awareness is inconceivable to us.  But the Soul-Self enjoys 
unbroken awareness as its very nature. So our aim is to silence 
our thoughts, still our emotions so we can raise our personality's 
awareness to that of the Soul's continuous Self-Awareness. 
Q. I sometimes feel and think that difficult worldly 
responsibilities are snuffing out my inner light.  I am concerned 
that I am losing my light and it may become extinguished. 
A. Keep in mind that it is simply not possible for your 
inner light to be extinguished. That light is the light of your 
Spirit-Soul nature, which is incorruptible and eternal. No 
possibility of losing that - ever.  What is possible is for that light 
to be eclipsed by your own reaction to experiences in our life, but 
nothing actually happens to the light.  Our response to difficult 
situations and life experiences either help thin the veil between 
our personality and the light of our Spirit-Soul Self or thicken and 
darken the veil of separation. But just like when a dark cloud 
passes in front of the sun, the cloud blocks our view of the sun 
and the light coming from the sun but that in no way affects 
th
e 
sun or its light.  So the real question is - What is that somethin
g 
in your personality's reactions to your difficult worldly 
200 

responsibilities 
that temporarily 
blocks 
the light of your Spirit 
Soul 
Self? 
Find 
that something 
and you will find your light again. 

Meditation 
Breathe deeply. Within the air you are breathing there is 
also the etheric vitality, which can be sent to any part of your 
etheric double of your material body. 
Breathe deeply. The air is only filling the lungs in your 
chest; it doesn't go anywhere else. But by breathing, you can feel 
the etheric vitality going out of your lungs to any part of your 
material body. You feel it by the aesthetic ether 
See how every time you breathe in, this etheric vitality is 
spread in your whole  material  body. You can feel your thighs. 
You can feel your legs and your feet. The air enters only in the 
lungs, yet the etheric vitality you are breathing can go anywhere 
you wish by concentrating in your material body through the 
etheric double. 
Feel from the top of your thighs to the tips of your toes. 
When you do this, you will notice that they are getting warm. 
There is warmth in the etheric vitality that is filling your feet. Try 
to feel this warmth now in your knees and in your thighs. 
Yogis who live in the cold mountains of the Himalayas can 
get this warmth-giving  etheric  vitality and use it to keep their 
bodies warm. 
Feel 
this sweet 
warmth, 
your 
etheric 
,�talit)', 
in 
your 
legs
, 
rour 
knees, 
your 
thighs, 
and sa

mind: 
"I want

h
ealth 
to be in these 
parts 
of my body." 
Subconscio
usly you are 
working 
for perfect 
health. 
The 
holy Archangels 
will be pleased 
to see that 
you 
coo
perate 
with their work. 
They 
see you.  They feel 
you.  They 
know 
you. 
But you don't 
know 
them 
-
yet! 
Breathe 
deeply 
and store 
this vital energy 
in your feet. 
Collect 
this energy 
in your legs and in your abdomen. 
Feel the 
vitality 
in your abdomen. 
Continue 
to breathe 
deeply 
and feel the 
air in  your lungs. 
Feel the  etheric 
vitality 
in your whole 
material 
body 
through its etheric 
double. 
Breathe 
deeply and 
comfortably. 
Fill the whole 
body with 
this etheric 
vitality. 
Feel that you are fully in your material 
body. 
There 
you exist, 
as an individual

BEING and EXISTING 
Existing has a beginning and an end and is thus a timed or 
temporal  phenomenon. Being is timeless and eternal, without 
beginning or end. 
CAUSES, IDEAS and PRINCIPLES 
The Will-pleasure of Absolute Beingness is the primal 
Cause, as it is the cause of Creation. It is from within the Will­
pleasure of Absolute Beingness, all the Causes spring. Causes then 
give rise to Ideas. Every Idea holds within it the whole Cycle of 
Possibility of the form to be created. Archangels work through 
the Ideas and impart Total Wisdom to each form. Principles 
govern the expression of Causes in time and space. 
CAUSAL STATE 
Above the Noetic State, the causal state is a condition of 
pure Ideas and Principles. It is also known as the fifth heaven. 
CAUSE AND EFFECT, LAW OF 
Scientists as well as mystics recognize the Law of Cause 
and Effect. This Divine Law requires every action to result in a 
reaction. Yet, whereas Eastern religions often teach a 
deterministic view of this Law (terming it Karma), we believe 
th
at 
206 

debts can be born for others or transcended through repentance 
(see below) and reparation. The Law of  Cause and Effect operates 
over several lifetimes as well as within much shorter periods. 
CHRIST, CHRIST LOGOS, LOGOS, LOGO!, 
LOG
OIC 
The Greek word Logos can be translated as 'word' (as the 
Authorized Version does in the first chapter of St. John's gospel). 
Christ, as used here, alone or in conjunction with Logos, refers to 
the 'Only Begotten Son'. When Jesus, as the incarnation of the 
Christ Logos, is specifically meant, He is sometimes referred to as 
'the Most Beloved  Logos'. In our work, we often speak of the 
Holy Logos and the God-Man Jesus Christ, a full, direct, and  pure 
incarnation of the Logoic expression of Absolute Beingness, 
synonymously. Logoi is the plural of Logos, Logoic is the 
adjective. 
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, COSMIC MEMORY 
Here every event, past and present, in all the worlds is 
recorded. A mystic can perform research by  attuning himself to 
the  Cosmic Consciousness. Contained within the Cosmic 
Consciousness is the Cosmic Memory. This is the 'heavenly 
207 

archive' where the impressions, actions, thoughts, emotions and 
desires of all the Beings are recorded. 
CYCLE/CIRCLE OF POSSIBILITIES 
The Cycle of Possibility of each form is laid down in Total 
Wisdom in the Dh�ne Laws and Causes. All forms are continually 
developing: from seed to tree, from child to adult. Each form 
changes so that experience may be gathered. In the Eternal Now a 
form is complete and based on a Principle, with its Cycle of 
Possibility already established. On entering the Worlds of 
Existence (material, Psychical and Noetical), the Cycle of 
Possibility is inscribed on the Permanent Personality, and 
parameters are set (time and place). No form may escape its Cycle 
of Possibility, thus ruling out transmigration from one form to 
any other (humans will  always reincarnate as humans). 
CYCLE/CIRCLE OF PROBABILITIES 
While the cycle of possibilities is the ideal development and 
is inescapable, the cycle of probabilities allows for the halting of a 
developing life at any point of its development. 
A seed may not grow, a young tree may become diseased 
and die, or a child may pass over. Within each Cycle of Possibility
, 
we find millions of cycles of probabilities; it is probable that 
208 

something 
or someone 
may 
stop 
existing 
or, conversel
y
, co
n
ti
nue 
to exist. 
Each 
Cycle 
of Possibility, 
whether 
fulftlled 
or interrupted, 
has 
great 
wisdom 
behind 
it in serving 
the Law. 
DIVINE 
Used 
only 
for the Qualities, 
Causes, 
Ideas, 
Laws 
and 
Principles, 
and 
Beings, 
which 
emanate 
directly 
from 
Absolute 
Beingness. 
DIVINE GRACE 
It is a gift of Divine 
Grace 
that 
we exist 
as humans, 
in our 
bodies, 
in the universes. 
DIVINE LAWS 
The 
Divine 
Laws 
are the basic 
structure 
of Creation, 
governing 
all worlds 
and 
universes, 
and 
corresponding 
to our 
higher 
nature. 
Epitomizing 
Reason 
and 
Love 
manifested, 
it is our 
recognition 
of, and 
alignment 
with, 
these 
Laws 
(e.g., 
of Cause 
and 
Effect, 
of Harmony, 
of Order, 
of Growth 
of Love), 
which 
leads 
to our 
balanced 
and 
enhanced 
spiritual 
development. 
209 

DIVINE MEDITATION 
Intricately linked to the Will-pleasure of Absolute 
Beingness to express Itself within Itself. Divine Meditation, for 
lack of a better term, is believed to be the state prior to the Will­
pleasure where Absolute Beingness contemplates expression. 
Within Divine Meditation Creation is conceived. 
DIVINE MERCY 
A little understood, but most compassionate force in 
Creation, that permits the seeming miraculous to take place. 
James, in his epistle, wrote, 'and mercy rejoices against jud
gm
ent' 
(
3:13
). 
DIVINE PLAN 
The Divine Plan is a blueprint of Creation, perfect and 
complete, accounting for everything and for all occurrences. 
Attuning our thoughts and actions to the most-wise Divine Plan 
of Absolute Beingness is the purpose of our existence. 
ECSTASY 
Ecstasy is a going out from oneself into the Kingdom of 
Heavens through expansion, At-One-Ment and/or Attunement. 
210 

Ecstasy implies a    passing beyond all conceptual thinking of 
discursive reason. 
EGO and EGOISM 
Our use of these terms is not to be confused with 
contemporary psychological terminology. Egoism defiles Mind by 
the construction of selfish desires, and by the base emotions of 
greed, malice and envy. The Ego (with a capital E) is the Self as 
Beingness, the Soul   nature, and is reflected through a reasoning 
and loving personalit
y
. \11,'hile egoism (a weakness of our present 
personality) is the source of disease throughout the personality, 
the nation and the world, our Ego nature brings fonh love, 
compassion, reasoned thinking and reasoned action. 
ELEMENTALS 
Every thought, emotion and desire creates and transmits an 
Elemental-also called thought-form-that carries on an existence of 
its own. We create and regenerate two types of Elementals. When 
an emotion governs a thought, we have created emotional 
thought-forms, or desire-thoughts. \'{ben our ideas, desires and 
emotions pass through reason and 10\·e, we create reasoned 
thought-forms,  or Thought-Desires. An Elemental can never be 
destroyed, only dis-energized (by no longer feeding the Elemental 
211 

with Etheric Vitality). Elementals of a kind collect to form 
powerful group Elementals. If an individual, or a collection of 
individuals, are vibrating at the same frequency, they will attract 
such group Elementals. Archangels also create Elementals: benign 
and angelic in the service of humanity. 
ETERNAL NOW, ETERNAL PRESENT 
Beyond the Worlds of Existence is the Eternal Now, the 
state of Everlasting Llfe. There, past, present and future collapse 
into a single present, without time or place. 
ETHER, ETHERIC VITALITY 
'Our daily bread', Etheric Vitality (Mind) is obtained 
through breathing, Meditation, eating and rest. We swim in a sea 
of Etheric Vitality which surrounds and permeates the globe, yet, 
through disharmonious lifestyles; most of us exhaust our portion 
of Etheric Vitality and are unable to restore it, leading to physical 
and psychic distress. All existence, including our bodies, is 
constructed within a mold of ether (the Etheric Double). We 
speak of four conditions of ether: creative, sensate, imprint and 
kinetic. 

ETHERIC CENTERS, SACRED DISCS 
Centers of energ
y 
and activity (Sanskrit: Chakras) located at 
various points on the Etheric Doubles of our bodies. Each of the 
three bodies, from the gross material to the more refined, displays 
these centers, which correspond to organs of the material body. 
We must exercise care  in working with  these  centers, for while it 
is necessary for us to develop and awaken certain of them, others 
are the domain of the Holy Spirit, the Archangels and the Logos 
(e.g., the 'root' and the  heart centers) and we should refrain from 
any manipulation or direct interference. (For 'Heart Center' see 
below) 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
Each body of every existence, from the simplest to the 
most 
complex 
structures, 
possesses 
an Etheric 
Double 
centered 
within 
the body 
and extending 
slightly 
beyond 
it. The Etheric 
Double 
exists 
as long 
as the body 
(whether 
material, 
Psychical 
or 
Noetical) 
is 
projecte
d. When 
a body 
is withdrawn 
(passes 
over) 
its 
Etheric 
Double 
dissolves. 
The Etheric 
Double 
serves 
as the 
mold 
for the 
body's 
constru
ction 
as well  as in the 
preserv
ation 
of 
the 
body's health. 
213 

EXOSOMATOSIS 
Exosomatosis, is the literal Greek equivalent of the English 
expression 'out of body experience'. We all leave our bodies each 
night, during sleep, and travel to other planes subconsciously. 
The aim, however, is to live consciously while out of our bodies. 
We know of first, second and third Exosomatosis. 
GUARDIAN ARCHANGEL 
At the point of our first incarnation, upon passing through 
the Human Idea, the Self-aware Soul is protected and guided, 
throughout its long sojourn into the worlds of separation, by an 
Archangel. This Archangel, our faithful companion, is from the 
Archangels of the Thrones. 
GROSS MATERIAL WORLD, BODY 
The material world is the lowest manifestation and 
vibration of Mind. Matter is Mind made solid to compose the 
material world and material bodies. 
FAITH 
Not only an individual or theoretical belief in the dogmatic 
truths of a religion, but an all-embracing relationship, recognition 
of, and love for Absolute Beingness. As such it involves a 
complete transformation of a person's personality, whereby we 
214 

are taken up into the whole the anthropic activity of God in 
Christ and of man in Christ through which we achieve Theosis. 
Faith,  above all, is an active virtue: 'Faith without works is dead ... ' 
Qames 3:26). Also see 'Repentance' below. 
HEAVENLY MAN/HUMAN IDEA 
T
he Idea of Man or Human Idea is an archetype. Our 
bodies are constructed according to the Causal Law of the 
Heavenly Man - Human Idea - Human Form. 
HEART CENTER 
Not simply the physical organ but the spiritual center of 
Mankind's Being. Man made in the image of Absolute Beingness 
as reason and love, our truest self, our inner sanctum, through 
which the mystery of the union between the Di,�ne and the 
mundane is consummated. 'Heart' has thus an  all-embracing 
significance. Prayer of the heart means prayer not just in the 
emotions and affections, but also of the whole person. We should 
strive to purify this heart for 'God knoweth your hearts,' writes 
Luke (16:15). 
215 

HOLY 
All Creation 
is Holy, 
born 
of the Divine 
expression. 
That 
which 
is Holy 
is projected 
(as opposed 
to that 
which 
is emanated) 
from 
the Divine. 
HOLY MONAD, 
HOLY MONADIC 
SELF 
The 
Holy 
Monadic 
Self 
is thought 
of as one 
of countless 
myriads 
of 'cells' 
within 
the Multiplicity 
of Absolute 
Beingness 
-
God. 
HOLY SPIRIT 
The 
Holy 
Spirit 
is the impersonal 
Super-Consciousness 
that 
expresses 
the power 
of Absolute 
Beingness 
and 
makes 
possible 
the Creation 
of the universes. 
It is the dynamic 
aspect 
of the 
Absolute. 
IDEA, DIVINE 
See under 
'Causes, 
Ideas 
and 
Principles' 
INNER SELF 
Inner 
Self 
is a term 
indicating 
the Self 
in its expressions 
above 
the present-day 
personality. 

KARMA 
See under Cause & Effect, Law of 
LOOKING WITHIN 
This is the process of Introspection or self-examination, of 
'knowing thyself'. This is the core practice of every Researcher of 
Truth and all those interested in Self Realization. 
MIND 
The Mind is a Divine emanation of Absolute Beingness to 
which all existences owe their construction. Imbued with the 
Divine Wisdom, Love, Power and Purity of its Creator, Mind is 
not an immortal  Being, but is eternally used as the substance of all 
Creation. Mind is Divine at its source, and Holy in its expression. 
NOETIC STATE 
This is a state of Ideas and unexpressed  forms beyond the 
worlds of separation. This state is where we  come to rest in 
between incarnations and where the Archangels derive the forms 
into which to breathe life. 

NOETICAL IMAGE 
A multi-dimensional image of Noetical or Psycho-Noetical 
substance, fanned by thought by means of Noetic light. Once 
formed it is everlasting, as are all Elementals. 
NOETICAL WORLD, BODY 
The five dimensional worlds and the most rarefied of the 
three worlds of separation. In the Noetical Worlds (home of the 
Noetical Body), the Total Wisdom of Absolute Beingness first 
finds expression as form, ranging frum universes and galaxies to 
unicellular organisms. Time and place are attributes of the 
Noetical World, but not in the sense understood in the psychic 
and material worlds. 
OVER LORDSHIP 
In varying degrees, we find over lordship as in a sense of 
dominion and Divine Authority as ordained from above. 
PERMANENT ATOM 
That part of the Permanent Personality, which acts as the 
recorder of the experiences, it has received in the place-time 
worlds. The Permanent Atom is situated in the etheric heart of 
each body simultaneously, and registers all the emotions, 
218

Wisdom. 
PRESENT, PRESENT-DAY, TEMPORARY 
PERSONALITY 
A personality developed during each incarnation, whom we 
call 'George or Mary' or whatever. The present-day personality is a 
projection of the Permanent Personalit
y 
into the worlds of 
separation. 
PSYCHIC/PSYCHICAL WORLD, BODY 
The psychical world is the four dimensional world, also 
known as the 'World of emotions'. The super-sensuous psychic 
World is composed of seven planes, each having seven sub­
planes. It is to the psychic World that we tm·el in first 
Exosomatosis, in our Psychical Body, and to which, on passing 
over, we first return. 
219 

PSYCHO-NOETICAL 
The relationship between the psychic World (emotions) 
and the Noetical World (thoughts) is often so intimate and 
interwoven that we need to consider them as semi-unified. In a 
thought there is often emotion, and in ever
y 
emotion there is a 
measure of thought. 
REPENTANCE 
The Greek word for repentance is metanoia, which 
signifies primarily a change of 'mind' or 'change of intellect': not 
only sorrow, contrition or regret, but also more positively and 
fundamentally the conversion or turning of our whole life towards 
alignment with Absolute Beingness' Divine Plan. Also see 'Faith' 
as described above. 
SELF-AWARENESS, SELF-AWARE, SELF­
CONSCIOUS 
This is conscious awareness, in varying degrees, of the Self 
within the Divine Plan. 
SELFHOOD 
The Personality as a unified, Divine, Being. Selfhood 
encompasses all the expression of the Self from Its apex as the 
220 

Hol
y Monadic 
Spirit-Ego-Being 
filtered 
down to the petty 
present 
da
y person
alit
y
. Within 
the Selfhood 
not a single 
expression is 
devalued
; each is 
cherished 
in its own right. Our 
Spirit-Ego-
Being 
partakes 
in the 
Will-Pleasure 
of Absolute 
Beingnes
s (to 
express 
Itself 
in.Itself) 
by expressing 
Itself within 
its own 
Selfhood. 
We 
mirror 
God's 
Good 
Creation 
within 
our own good c
reation, 
within our Selfhood. 
SELF-REALIZATION 
Self-Realization of the Permanent Personality as 
Individuated Beingness. This is the culmination of the gathering 
of experience in the worlds of separation. At the point of Self­
Realization, the Permanent Personality reunified with Self-aware 
Soul is prepared to assimilate with the Spirit-Ego-Being in 
Theosis. 
SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
Self-Sufficiency is the primary Nature of Absolute 
Beingness, in complete Abundance, Blessedness and 
independence of all   needs. 

SEPARATION, WORLDS OF EXISTENCE 
This phrase covers the three worlds of existence (material, 
psychic and N oetical) in which our personality spends periods of 
seeming separation from the Spirit states of At-One-Ment and 
Beingness 
SOUL 
A Soul is formed when a ray of a Holy Monad passes 
through the Idea of Heavenly Man. The Soul is not created; it is a 
small pearl from the Spirit, which comes to be known as the Self­
aware Soul. The Soul is in a formless state as Spirit, and remains 
formless. When returning to the Godhead, marries the Spirit-Ego­
Being, it has become fuller. 
SPIRIT-EGO-BEING 
Our Self in its full divinity; it is eternal and unmovable. Our 
Spirit-Ego-Being is the Self as Holy Monad; in total At-One-Ment 
with the Self-Sufficiency and Multiplicity of the Godhead. The 
Will-pleasure of Absolute Beingness to express Itself within Itself 
is identical with the Will of our Spirit-Ego-Being to express Itself 
in  Its own Selfhood. 

SUB CONSCIOUS, SUB CONSCIOUSNESS 
Researchers of the Truth understand the triadic nature of 
Sub Consciousness. One chamber of the subconscious contains 
all the Elementals composing our personality. A second chamber 
is the storehouse of Etheric Vitality (sometimes called our 'animal 
vitality') The third and most valued chamber is that of the Logos 
and Holy Spirit, for it is through the subconscious that the Holy 
Spirit and the Logos impart Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total 
Love. 
SUPER-CONSCIOUSNESS 
Super-consciousness is total awareness in Beingness. 
SYSTEM FOR THE RESEARCH OF TRUTH 
Our system of Esoteric Christianity celebrates the eternal 
truths known to all great religious traditions, while firmly based in 
the teachings of the God-Man Jesus Christ and the New 
Testament. Through directed study, exercises and Meditations, we 
seek the balanced evolution and integration of our entire being. 
Our approach is methodical, safe and self-e,�dent. 

TETRAKTYS 
(Pronounced tet-ruk-TEES) A group of four. The elements 
of Earth, Air, Fire and water compose a tetraktys. 
THEOS IS 
At-One-Ment with the One God, Absolute Beingness. 
TOTAL LOVE, WISDOM and POWER 
These are the Primary Natures of Absolute Beingness and 
Beings. Forming a sacred triangle each Nature is dependent on 
the other to be expressed properly. 
WILL-PLEASURE 
The Greek word 'euareskeia' has no exact equivalent in 
English. It carries a sense of pleasure  derived from bountiful 
giving, as practiced by a warmly generous and wealthy source. 
Will-Pleasure was used in preference to 'bounty' or 'charity' to 
avoid misconceptions. We have described euareskeia as 'God's 
pleasure in creativeness'.
