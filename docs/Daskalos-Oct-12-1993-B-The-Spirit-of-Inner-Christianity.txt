Daskalos-Oct-12-1993-B-The-Spirit-of-Inner-Christianity These two divine planes, heavens, you cannot find in it any change. There you can see the total wisdom of God, as laws, principles, ideas, causes. Through all that, all forms are reflected, entering in the other worlds or heavens. Now, studying the forms, nothing can exist unless it has a form, nothing in the material world, nothing in the ethereal, nothing in the psychic, nothing in the noetical, unless it has a form. Entering in the divine plan, in the total wisdom and the all-mightiness, entering in what we call the circle of existence and possibilities of that kind. You can find this circle of existence and all-mightiness and total wisdom even in the material plane. Studying the life of a worm, a fly, a butterfly, an animal, a tree, you see that nothing can escape from the all-mightiness of the holy archangels, controlling that phenomenon of life. So, we find the divine also in the mundane. And one who studies all these things will find this law in all the worlds, in all the heavens. Nothing is beyond the all-mightiness of Allah and His holy archangels. What's beyond? Those are seven heavens. But in God, beingness, are many, many, many heavens. They asked Joshua, Emmanuel, to speak to them. What did he reply? Did you understand the mundane and want to know more about the divine? He said, in your testament. With what language he could tell them? Greek or Aramaic? The divine things. Impossible. But what he has promised them, calling all these seven heavens, his father's mansion, same house. In the house of my father there are many mansions. In the house of my father there are many mansions. And I go to prepare a place for you. And I go to prepare a place for you. Place. A place. So, only in these seven heavens there is the sense of place. And only in these seven heavens there is the sense of place. Beyond that there is no sense of place. Beyond that there is no sense of place. What is it? What can it be? What can it be? So we can know only the house of our father with its many mansions. So we can know only the house of our father with its many mansions. But we are not allowed to know much outside of this house. What gives us the sense of place? You find yourself in a certain place. You know. You might call it environment. Houses. Trees. Legs. Mountains. People. You are living in that place and you enter another place. Again, a place. Different. Different trees. Hills, lakes, water. Different people. So you can be in any place. And get presentations. Creating them in your representations. The kind of understanding. Knowing. This is how we know things in the worlds of existence. Developing now the self- consciousness to higher levels. What does it mean self-superconsciousness? Be at the same time in many places. But not only in one. Yet being present there in all the places. That means extension of the comprehension of the presentation. This is what you can gain by the self-superconsciousness. What is the divine now? Selfhood. Comparing you and the self-superconsciousness. Which means receiving presentations, making them in your selfhood. Representations. Something which is there. Representations. What is there? You make them. You are all self. It's marvelous. But human. Not divine. What is stepping out of the noetical plane? It's not learning anymore. It's not conceiving anymore. It's not understanding anymore. It's being. I know it. What it gives you? A pleasure and splendor beyond words. Is that the paradise? No. Because the paradise is the opposite of the hell. And it is in the words of the opposites. In the words of the duality. It is in the words of existence. What I say now is something beyond the words of the duality. It is in the words of the oneness. You are in Allah. What is the difference with us now? God is in every one of us. But are we in God? No. Because you are in the world of separateness. Your body, flesh, blood and bones. You have to forget that. You have just to know that you are not matter. You are not even the substance. The sexual body. Or the super substance. Or the mind. No coming again to Jesus Emmanuel the Christ. In cosmogony. In cosmos. So the holy archangels of the elements. Vibrating to the total wisdom and the almightyness. Using the mind vitality. Super substance. Are creating the heavens, all the heavens. And we said the life light. They are using. It is a luminosity of seven kinds of brightness. Creating what? The sensitivity. Of the rocks. The sensibility. Of the animals. The sub-consciousness of human beings. The inner consciousness. The instinct of the animals. These are all forms of life. The self-consciousness of the human beings. Self-super-consciousness of the human beings. These are ways of manifesting the self. Are we our consciousness? No. Our consciousnesses. Instinctive. Sub-conscious. The so-called self-awareness. Consciousness. The super-consciousness. Are our expressions. In the various heavens. But what did Jesus Emmanuel Christ said? The kingdom of the heavens is in your spirit, ego, self being. So. We are more than our expressions. Because we are spirit, soul, ego being. Not confined in bodies. In places. Entangled with circumstances. But we are more. Much more. We can enter in the oneness of God. In our self-realization. In our self-realization. As Joshua used to tell the Jews. The kingdom of the heavens which is in our nature. As spirit, soul, ego being. Immortal. Everlasting. Why don't we remember what we have been? Because that handful of earth in our brains is heavy. When we get rid of it. Then we remember. How get rid of it? After the death of our body to decay and this material brain to decay also? No. Even having that material brain. The material body, flesh, blood and bones. Finding who you are as a self being. We can develop our self-consciousness. How? God gave us the mind vitality. The mind light. The mind life. Our daily bread. Which we must use. To unfold our selfhood. And of course enter in the divine selfhood. Joshua Emmanuel the God man. Gave, he went to the Jews, to the Israelites and to everybody. Be ye perfect. As perfect as your divine father. Which means? We can be. Because he was perfect as his heavenly father. Now, what was Joshua's prayer? Which he had composed when he was 16 years of age. It is not as it is today, the Lord's Prayer. He had composed it in the Greek language and the Aramaic language. Which was the language he was using in his home life. Because the Essenes were Greek speaking Israelites. And also the Aramaic language. What she said? Our father. Who are in the heavens. Your name is holy. Everywhere. And your kingdom is. In the heavens. And on earth. And your will. Is done in the heavens. So it is done on earth also. That's what she said. And she said more. Not even a leaf from a tree. Is falling down from the branch of the tree. Unless it is the will of God. And when Pilate told him. Asking him what is the truth. He did not reply. He said, don't you know that I can crucify you or set you free. I have that power of doing it. What did she reply? You have nothing and no authority on me or on anybody unless it is given you from above. Unless it is the will of the father. Now you have it in your mind now. That the will of God is always done. It is stupid to be against the will of God. We have to admit whatever it comes to us. Because what comes to us. Is the outcome of our own thoughts and actions. God has given us the mind to work. Understand. And live in the proper life. As God has given the air. And everybody is breathing and living. He has given to everybody the mind vitality. The mind life. And the mind light. As understanding. Do we need help? If we need help, who will ask you? Ask and it will be given to you. Seek the truth and you will find it. Open. Knock on the gates of the heavens and it will be opened to you. So there is no excuse. What do I mean to say? Life is good. Unless it was good, God wouldn't give it to us as human beings. But the life of each one of us as we make it. But the life of each one of us as we make it. Is difficult. And he said. On the material plane, on earth. In this world. You will have many afflictions. But cheer up. I have won over the difficulties of the world. Which means. You can do it. So we follow his instructions. We follow his instructions. And correct the way of living. Correct the way we are making life and we are living. We are given the mind to think. To use it. And for a human being. Who can use the mind in thinking. Reasoning. And who is creating through the mind. Vitality as energy. Angel. Human elementals. Instead of human demons. He should live happy. A happy life. So we should not blame God. Or blame others. Blame ourselves. No. Just make good use of the mind. And we can get out of the mud we have created. So. God the father. The holy archangel. The lord of the elements. Has given us a human body. From the human point of view. It is perfect. Joshua Manuel is calling our body the temple of God. By right thinking and by introspection. We can come to the conclusion. That these great beings, the archangels. Unceasingly. Are working sustaining our bodies. So that we as present the personality self. Live in it. God the father. Is giving us the eternal life. The mind. Vitality. Light. To use it. As thoughts. He is giving us also. That mind. Substance. To express ourselves as. Gentle feelings. Not getting angry. Shading. Fighting. Attacking other people. And in making the emotions. Our weaknesses. Shading. That means creating for us. A shell. By creating. Human demons. Just to compose our personality self. So could realize. That we are not that time and place. Sinful self. But that we are the spirit. Soul ego self. God. An offspring of God. So the duty of every. Seeker or researcher of the truth. Is to study the way. He or she is living. And by reasoning. Make corrections. Of course one should ask. The help and the enlightenment. Of the father. He is in every one of us. And she's expecting that we should be. One with him. Enter in his oneness. What do we find there? Love. Life. Light. Happiness. You cannot find happiness in the material world. And nothing material. And no human being around us. Can give us happiness. Things and people can give us. From time to time. Kind of satisfaction. To fit in. Nothing. So happiness. Is when we find. God in our being self. What I call self realization. Through introspection. Right meditation. Visualization. Visualization means seeing. Through another. Kind of light. Visualization means seeing with another light. Which is a program. Do you want to give an exercise now? We have to go.
