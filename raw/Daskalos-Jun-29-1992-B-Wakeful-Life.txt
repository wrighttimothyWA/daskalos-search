Daskalos-Jun-29-1992-B-Wakeful-Life
Now,	 this	 fellow,	 after	 two	 days,	 was	 speaking	 to	 some	 other	 friends,	 and	 he	 said,
Daskalos,	he	doesn't	like	me,	and	he	doesn't	like	my	son	either.	I	thought	he	loved	me.
We	talked	so	much,	but	no,	he	doesn't	like	me.
He	didn't	lose	the	opportunity.	He	said,	you	come	here.	You	are	mistaken.
In	reality,	I	love	you,	and	I	love	your	son.	I	don't	like	stupidities.	Then	I	said,	we'll	change
your	attitude	towards	your	son,	because	you	will	spoil	him.
I	like	the	boy.	That's	why	I'm	pointing	out	that	he	shouldn't	have	done	it.	Now,	I	don't
know	if	he	understood	that,	or	not.
Now,	what	do	I	want	to	say?	We	should	always	use	one	measure.	For	us,	for	our	boys,	for
the	neighbors,	for	everybody.	Not	two	measures.
And	the	right	measure,	that	means	not	overdoing	it,	to	be	strict	to	the	children.	No.	It's
very	bad.
To	punish	children,	punish	others,	that's	still	too	bad.	So	I	prefer	some	of	these	measures
to	break	them	and	throw	them	away.	Not	use	them	at	all.
But	use	golden	measures	now.	Not	measures	made	of	wood,	or	iron,	or	other	material.
Golden	measures.
Which	means	love.	If	you	are	using	this	measure,	which	is	love,	expressing	love,	and
then	pointing	out	things	in	a	gentle	way,	the	others	are	ready	to	accept	it.	Otherwise,
they	will	not.
So	 we	 have	 just	 to	 study	 the	 character	 of	 the	 people.	 That	 means	 psychology.	 And
according	to	their	character,	to	use	the	method	to	change	them.
No.	To	enlighten	them.	Not	to	change	them.
Not	for	the	sake	of	changing	them.	But	for	the	sake	of	making	them	feel	happier.	And
more	reasonable	in	life.
Because	unless	we	are	going	to	believe	that	we	should	change	them,	we	are	not	serving
anybody	except	our	egoism.	Because	we	should	be	very	careful.	Because	the	egoism	is	a
devil	presenting	itself	as	an	angel	of	light.
They	said	before	that	the	egoism	of	the	personality	is	very,	very	cunning.	And	we	should
be	always	very,	very	careful.	Careful	not	allowing	the	egoism	to	interfere.
Neither	 presenting	 itself	 as	 an	 angel	 of	 light.	 Even	 presenting	 itself	 as	 charity	 and

goodness.	We	shall	see	what	is	behind	all	that.
Because	in	life,	one	should	be	always	careful.	Many,	many	things	are	deceiving.	And	one
should	be	careful	not	to	be	deceived.
Using	the	mind	again.	In	how	many	ways?	In	every	way	and	always.	This	is	what	we
need.
Just	to	learn	how	to	use	our	mind.	How	to	use	it	as	reasoning	thought.	Nothing	should
escape	our	attention.
Good	or	bad.	I	don't	like	the	word	evil.	There	is	no	evil	man.
No	human	being	is	evil.	Stupid,	yes.	Ignorant,	yes.
And	at	the	same	time	unhappy.	Self-punishing,	yes.	But	not	evil.
Because	no	human	being,	being	a	god	in	nature,	can	be	evil.	Must	have	this	in	our	mind.
So	hating	a	human	being	is	hating	God.
I	cannot	hate	a	human	being.	As	I	said	and	I	repeat	it.	There	are	not	evil	people.
They	can	be	ignorant,	stupid,	unhappy	people.	Always	unhappy.	If	they	are	stupid.
But	not	evil.	And	something	else.	You	cannot	help	any	human	being	by	criticizing	him.
Her.	Or	with	enmity	and	hostility.	No.
Our	human	beings	around	us.	Those	who	we	call	evil.	Are	in	need	of	our	love.
They	are	not	in	need	of	our	hatred	or	complaints.	Or	criticism.	I	said	that	one	should
never	criticize.
Should	have	this	in	mind.	You	will	never	be	able	to	help	someone.	Criticizing	of	her.
Hating,	despising.	You	will	never	be	able	to	help	them.	So	a	real	human	being	should
have	a	heart.
Radiating	love.	Love	as	a	bright	sun.	Just	lighting	the	faces	of	every	human	being.
When	the	sun	is	giving	us	light.	There	are	good	people	and	evil	people.	Is	he	denying
that	light.
The	heat	and	warmth.	To	those	we	consider	evil.	No.
So,	likewise.	You	are	supposed	to	make	our	hearts	a	sun.	That	must	be	a	sun.
Radiating	love.	Love	for	everyone.	And	this	love.

This	light.	Everybody	is	in	need	of.	To	find	his	way.
And	those	we	call	sinners.	Criminals.	Thieves.
Names	given	to	people.	By	the	others.	Usually	by	those	who	are	just	the	same	as	they
are.
Because	if	you	are	not	like	that,	you	will	never	observe	that.	So,	all	these	people	are	not
in	need	of	our	criticism.	They	are	in	need	of	our	love.
Guidance.	Guidance.	Nobody	will	accept	guidance.
Even	your	children.	And	Christ	didn't	say.	Guide	the	people.
Because	he	was	the	greatest	psychologist	in	the	world.	He	said.	Thus	should	be	the	light
of	what	you	do.
Your	actions.	So	that	the	others	would	see	it	and	follow	it.	He	said	that	in	Greek.
Not	 only	 that.	 And	 glorify	 your	 heavenly	 father.	 Christ	 was	 speaking	 in	 the	 Greek
language	and	in	Aramaic.
So	in	the	bible.	Written	in	Greek.	Are	the	real	teaching	of	Christ.
What	was	said	by	the	mouth	of	Christ.	So.	The	people	are	not	in	need	of	our	guidance.
By	asking	them	to	change.	But	by	following	us.	Seeing	what	we	are	doing.
Now.	One	should	try	to	find.	I	am	doing	this	for	of	criticizing	people	around	me.
Most	of	the	people	are	doing	that.	Criticizing.	Just	gossiping.
Now.	Usually	in	a	society.	There	are	many	many	rumors.
Of	 course	 for	 everything	 there	 must	 be	 a	 cause	 behind	 it.	 The	 enmity	 of	 someone
against	somebody	else.	And	they	are	creating	imaginary	stories	against	that	fellow.
And	of	course	these	people	like	that	to	spread	out.	All	these	rumors.	Are	we	sure.
Being	in	a	place.	Hearing	these	rumors.	Are	we	sure.
We	are	using	our	mind	and	reason.	Not	accepting.	All	those	things.
Not	allowing	ourselves	to	continue	interfering.	And	saying	something.	We	suspect.
This	is	what	happens	in	all	communities.	But	I	heard	so.	Because	I	heard	so.
You	think	you	have	the	right	to	repeat	it.	What	is	the	reason	I	am	saying.	Now.

We	know	that	every	thought.	Is	creating	an	elemental.	Elementals	are	all	around	us.
Especially	the	elementals.	On	gossip.	To	strengthen	these	elementals.
Or	 by	 avoiding	 taking	 place.	 We	 try	 to	 dis-energize	 them.	 Attacking	 those	 who	 are
spreading	the	rumors.
It's	stupid.	Because	doing	so.	They	will	insist	spreading	more.
So	that's	not	the	best	way.	Best	way	is	keeping	silent.	Saying	nothing.
And	sending.	Just	an	elemental	of	kindness.	To	both.
The	accuser.	And	the	accused.	And	just	the	warm	wish.
That	they	should	reconcile.	And	love	each	other.	This	is	the	right	behavior.
So	I	have	given	so	many	ways.	In	using	in	the	right	way.	The	mind	has	thought.
And	that's	the	proper	behavior.	Tomorrow	it	will	be	the	last	lesson.	For	this	season.
We	 will	 speak	 more	 about	 the	 elementals.	 From	 a	 different	 point	 of	 view	 now.	 As
torturing	devils.
Torturing	demons.	Because	during	these	days.	I	see	many	many	people	coming	to	me.
Just	saying	that	they	are	obsessed.	By	demons.	By	so	many	things.
In	reality	they	are	under	the	burden	of	their	own	evil	elementals.	So	the	best	thing	is.
Instead	of	encouraging	these	things.
Advise	these	people.	To	change	their	own	attitude.	Their	way	of	thinking.
Because.	 We	 are	 the	 first	 to	 be	 attacked	 by	 the	 malicious	 elementals.	 That	 we	 are
creating.
That's	clear.	So	one	should	be	responsible.	For	what	he	is	creating.
Every	moment.	Human	beings	are	using	the	mind	in	the	wrong	way.	Everybody	is	using
the	mind.
But	in	the	wrong	way.	Not	as	masters	of	the	mind.	Using	right	thoughts.
But	just	in	mixing	up.	In	the	gossip.	In	the	way	people	are	thinking	around	them.
Just	adding	something	to	it.	So	we	should	be	now	careful.	In	how	to	use	this	holy	super
substance	of	the	mind.
Because	we	should	see	the	mind.	Not	only	as	thought.	But	also	as	energy.

Having	thought.	As	elementals.	Affecting	the	life	of	everybody	around	us.
And	our	life.	So	if	we	are	just	to	correct	this	world.	We	should	correct	ourselves.
In	how	we	are	using	the	mind.	Now	we	make	an	exercise.	Take	breaths.
Comfortably.	Deep	breaths.	And	relax	completely.
Your	material	body.	Feel	you	are	completely	relaxed.	Start	from	the	feet.
Knees,	belly,	chest,	head.	You	are	completely	relaxed.	Now	relax	yourself.
From	every	thought.	Or	feeling.	Forget	who	you	are.
Feel	you	are	in	the	whole	body.	And	not	in	the	head.	Just	feel	your	body.
You	are	in	the	whole	body.	Free	from	desires	and	emotions.	Completely.
And	of	thoughts.	You	are	now	in	your	material	body.	Feeling	it.
Now	put	a	question	to	yourself.	I	am	living	in	this	material	body.	This	moment	the	Holy
Archangels	are	working	in	my	material	body.
In	every	blood	cell.	In	the	blood.	In	every	artery.
In	every	vein.	In	every	organ.	Everywhere.
These	Holy	Archangels	are	working.	For	me.	For	me	to	feel	I	am	living	in	this	material
body	now.
Considering	me	a	God.	I	am	feeling	my	material	body.	I	am	in	it.
I	have	the	right	to	be	in	it.	Am	I	using	the	material	body	in	the	right	way?	Do	I	give	really
love	with	my	material	body?	Or	am	I	just	caressing	a	child	with	my	hand?	Giving	a	kiss.
Embracing	somebody	I	love.
Or	I	give	slaps	instead.	And	kicks.	I	am	allowed	to	express	myself	through	this	material
body	in	many	ways.
Using	the	eyes.	Seeing.	Very	serious	work	of	the	Archangels	of	the	elements.
To	keep	the	liquids	of	the	eyes.	In	such	a	state	as	I	would	see	through	my	material	eyes.
Using	my	mouth.
Not	only	in	eating.	But	in	speaking.	Talking.
Am	I	sure	I	am	using	my	mouth?	Talking	in	the	right	way?	Giving	love?	Or	wounding?
Offending?	Humiliating	the	others?	Am	I	using	really	the	speech,	a	gift	of	the	Father	who

deprived	it	from	the	other	animals	around	me,	in	the	right	way?	Christ	said,	what	enters
through	 the	 mouth	 is	 giving	 you	 no	 heart.	 What	 is	 coming	 out	 of	 the	 mouth	 is	 very
harmful	sometimes.	For	which	you	should	be	careful.
Who	 am	 I?	 How	 do	 I	 behave?	 Am	 I	 the	 master	 of	 my	 behavior?	 Or	 the	 victim	 of	 an
egoism?	Enough.
