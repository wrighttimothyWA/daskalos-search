So,	I	taught	him,	you	should	believe	in	God.	We're	looking	at	him.	Not	in	the	God	of	the
priests.
He	liked	that.	Because	he	was	not	in	good	time	with	the	priests.	Which	God?	Which	God?
Life.
You	are	God.	You're	looking	at	me.	You	are	living.
Yes.	You	have	been	married.	Yes.
God	gave	you	two	children.	Do	you	think	that	these	children	born	to	you	as	a	son	and	a
daughter	are	really	yours?	Did	you	know	what	you	are	doing	by	making	love?	He	started
just	reasoning.	He	says,	that's	the	cause.
In	nature.	Now,	you	tell	God	nature.	Now,	let	us	study	what	you	say	in	nature	as	the	total
wisdom,	as	life.
And	as	a	purpose	behind	it.	Where	shall	I	find	God?	In	your	heart	you	have	made	so	dirty.
He	started	crying.
In	my	heart	I	made	it	so	dirty.	Yes.	By	loving?	Not	by	loving.
You	have	the	right	to	love.	But	you	should	love	every	woman	you	felt	love	for	her	in	your
age	as	your	sister.	And	in	being	more	old	as	your	mother.
Why	love	her?	In	a	way	you	did.	That	belongs	to	your	wife.	You	brought	children	in	the
world.
Really,	you	make	me	feel	afraid.	That's	good.	Because	now	you	realize	the	reality.
You	know	what	it	is.	Shall	I	go	to	a	church?	No	need.	But	you	should	go	to	a	church.
A	church?	Which	church?	When	you	make	your	heart	your	church	you	will	enter	there
and	there	you	will	just	worship	your	God.	Your	heart	is	your	church.	In	reality.
Clean	it.	Love.	Use	reason.
Thank	 God	 for	 giving	 you	 these	 two	 children.	 And	 start	 to	 understand	 your
responsibilities	towards	this	great	gift	of	God.	That	was	an	honor.
Made	to	you.	To	have	those	children.	I	said,	don't	say	anything	more.
I	think	I	understand.	I	started	laughing.	Who	taught	you	that?	I	said,	God	in	you.

He	is	waking	you	up.	Now	go	to	your	wife.	To	your	children.
To	your	work.	Don't	look	behind.	Don't	start	repenting.
Oh,	I	have	spent	so	many	things.	So	much.	Nearly	my	whole	property	for	all	that	and
that.
No.	Don't	start	thinking	like	that.	Now	make	corrections.
I	think	I	understood.	Can	I	tell	you	are	less	yourself?	Of	course	you	can.	But	first	purify	a
little	bit	your	heart.
Start	to	use	your	mind.	And	come.	You	are	welcome.
Now,	what	is	the	duty	of	every	human	being	now?	First,	to	make	a	sincere	self-analysis.
And	by	self	I	mean	the	present-day	personality.	Put	down	things.
And	through	introspection,	check	what	is	going	on	in	the	present-day	personality.	Which
means	entering	worldly	in	your	so-called	subconsciousness.	No	need	just	to	be	afraid	of
doing	so.
Don't	try	just	to	accuse	yourself	now.	That's	a	stupid	way.	Of	approaching	things.
You	 are	 starting	 that	 behavior	 of	 yours	 as	 a	 third	 person.	 Reasoning	 now.	 Not	 with
masochistic	tendencies.
Because	that's	a	kind	of	hypocrisy	of	the	egoism	of	the	personality.	You	have	to	get	rid	of
it.	So,	now	you	are	reasoning.
Should	we	not	repent?	This	is	just	a	stupid	thing.	What's	repentance?	Knowing	the	truth
and	changing	things.	Repent.
What	 is	 done	 is	 done.	 What's	 past	 is	 past.	 Why	 should	 we	 look	 behind?	 Let	 us	 look
forward.
Making	 corrections	 means	 now	 making	 corrections	 for	 what	 we	 call	 the	 future.	 Why
should	we	return	to	the	past	and	start	masochistic	now?	Repentance	and	all	that.	Some
of	the	church	people	just	suggest	that.
And	they	find	it	stupid.	Christ	never	spoke	about	these	things.	He	said	clearly,	Know	the
truth	and	the	truth	will	set	you	free	from	illusions	and	from	everything.
So,	what	is	the	duty	of	every	human	being	now?	Learn	the	truth	concerning	the	mind.
The	 nature	 of	 the	 mind.	 Learn	 the	 truth	 concerning	 his	 behavior	 or	 her	 behavior	 in
creating	or	revitalizing	elementals.
That's	a	great	truth.	Look	now	into	the	subconsciousness	to	find	out	what	is	there.	Check

predispositions.
Why?	Put	a	burning	fire	there.	You	have	to	give	an	answer	to	yourself.	Your	guardian
angel	will	help	you	in	reaching	the	right	conclusions.
Then,	you	realize	that	now	it's	given	me	the	right	to	use	the	mind	in	the	right	way.	And
by	doing	it,	you	come	to	the	realization	who	you	are.	I'm	using	the	mind.
And	using	the	mind,	I.	First	you	reach	your	real	I-ness	now.	And	your	I-ness	is	not	the
egoism.	With	the	weaknesses	and	with	the	wrong	behavior.
I,	now,	can	study	my	emotions	and	my	desires.	See	what	is	wrong	and	what	is	not	wrong.
The	egoism	will	present	itself.
Yes,	but	that	pleased	me.	Catch	him.	No.
Now	I'm	studying	and	I	know	the	truth.	Now	I	know	you.	You	are	not	myself.
Then	start	using	the	mind.	And	which	is	the	real	gain?	You	know	who	you	are.	You	are	an
I-ness	not	yet	knowing	what	is	your	I-ness	or	your	selfhood.
Who	can	now	use	my	body,	my	material	body,	in	the	way	I	am	choosing?	What	I	call	the
right	way.	Controlling	the	body.	I	can	now	check	my	desires,	my	emotions.
Know	everything	about	them.	Know	the	consequences	that	will	come	following	certain
desires	or	emotions.	And	by	sorting,	now	I	find	who	I	am.
I'm	a	strong	being	who	can	get	decisions,	stick	to	decisions,	and	stop	being	influenced	by
my	personality's	egoism,	which	is	not	myself.	I	call	that	introspection	or	looking	within	or
making	what	I	will	say	sincere	psychoanalysis.	And	you	have	to	do	it	for	yourself,	not	the
others.
But	with	sincerity	and	the	right	thinking.	What	you'll	find	out?	That	in	many	cases	there
will	be	a	serious	clash	between	your	heart	and	your	mind.	What	you	do	now?	Now	there
is	a	serious	fighting	to	calm	down	things.
Said	to	the	card.	No	more	making	mistakes.	There	must	be	an	end	to	that	thing.
Now	again	the	egoism	of	the	personality	will	present	itself,	but	I	like	that.	Stop	it.	Now,
using	the	mind,	we	have	to	control	our	heart.
Should	we	be	cruel	to	our	heart?	No,	your	heart	will	be	the	first	to	thank	you,	setting	it
free	 from	 mistakes	 and	 from	 weaknesses.	 And	 everybody	 has	 just	 to	 clean	 the	 heart.
Because	we'll	not	see	God	with	our	human	material	eyes.
We'll	 not	 even	 see	 God	 with	 our	 mind,	 but	 with	 our	 heart.	 And	 in	 the	 Beatitudes,	 the
Church	of	Emmanuel	Christ,	the	Godman	who	came	down	on	earth	to	show	us	the	way

and	teach	us	who	we	are,	what	we	are,	how	we	should	live,	what	is	life,	what	are	we,
what	is	God	said.	Blessed	are	the	pure	in	heart,	for	they	shall	see	God.
It	is	with	the	heart	one	will	see	God.	Because	God	is	love.	Impersonal	love.
Pure	love.	Love	for	all	and	to	all.	But	love	doesn't	mean	immorality.
We	must	have	that	in	our	mind.	Love	doesn't	mean	making	love.	This	is	what	one	should
know	and	understand.
To	put	things	in	their	right	place.	Love.	Here's	Miracelo.
Shall	I	hate	that	woman?	No!	You	must	love	her,	continue	loving	her.	But	love	is	not	what
you	thought	is	love.	Just	that	feeling	of	your	mind,	possessiveness,	this	and	that,	and	all
those	stupid	behaviors.
Love	her.	And	if	she	will	be	in	need	of	you	sometime,	to	come	to	you,	treat	her	as	your
sister.	But	not	more	than	that.
So	we	have	to	transmit	love	to	its	right	expression.	By	using	the	mind	to	control	and	the
heart	and	our	whole	behavior.	Shall	we	love	ourselves?	Of	course	we	should.
But	loving	ourselves	means	cleaning	them,	purifying	them.	This	is	love	to	ourselves.	And
not	surrendering	to	weaknesses	and	to	faults.
Of	course	we	have	to	love	ourselves.	In	transmuting	it	someday	to	our	real	self.	Which	is
in	it.
Do	we	have	two	selves	now?	No.	We	have	one	self	as	a	line	with	two	points.	We	don't
have	two	lines,	we	have	one	line.
We	have	one	self	with	two	points	now.	It's	material,	in	time	and	place,	in	a	human	body.
The	expression,	as	I	said	before,	the	shadow	of	yourself.
But	behind	it	is	the	light.	And	you	are	the	light,	not	the	shadow.	So	we	have	just,	with
what	I	call	self-analysis,	analyzing	our	present	day,	time	and	place	self.
Finding	it,	our	real	self.	Which	is	the	life	in	it.	So	that	the	personality	to	be	living,	to	live
the	material	world,	must	have	the	parts	of	life	to	live.
Which	is	our	self,	our	real	self.	And	that	self	we	have	to	find	and	feel	we	are	that.	The
parts	of	life.
Life	and	not	the	weaknesses	in	life.	I	think	you	understood	what	I	really	mean.	By	self-
analysis.
Analyzing	the	present	day	personality	to	reach	the	reality	behind	it.	Which	is	our	real

self.	And	finding	your	self,	there	will	be	happiness.
Don't	 expect	 to	 find	 happiness	 as	 a	 personality.	 By	 things	 which	 are	 changing	 every
moment.	And	are	not	stable.
You	will	find	happiness	and	satisfaction	in	realizing	that	you	are	eternal,	immortal	God.
With	a	name?	Yes.	But	not	a	name	you	have	as	a	man	or	as	a	woman.
That	is	passing.	You	had	many,	many,	many	such	names	in	your	past	incarnations.	But
yet,	in	every	incarnation	you	had	your	name.
Without	 noticing	 it.	 Adding	 to	 your	 name,	 just	 another	 name.	 Deceiving	 you	 that	 you
were	that.
Name	of	a	man	or	a	woman.	I	am	church.	Take	a	church.
What	remains?	I	am.	I	am	existing.	Until	you	take	that	out.
I.	And	then	you	are	the	immortal	God.	Your	life.	So,	you	are	saying	what	you	are	without
realizing	what	you	are	saying.
So,	 what's	 our	 name?	 Common	 name	 to	 all	 and	 for	 all.	 I.	 The	 I-ness.	 The	 self-
superconsciousness.
Now,	make	a	meditation.	What	is	self?	What	is	that	entity	with	its	awareness	of	who	or
what	 it	 is?	 Now,	 it	 will	 be	 difficult	 at	 the	 beginning.	 But	 rely	 on	 the	 help	 of	 your	 holy
guardian	archangel	who	is	within	you.
Just	ready	to	see	you.	That	you	want	to	know	and	will	come	to	your	help.	A	fellow	told
me.
Yes,	sir,	really.	I	would	be	very	happy	if	I	come	in	contact	with	my	guardian	archangel,
my	 guardian	 angel.	 I	 said,	 you	 are	 every	 moment	 in	 contact	 with	 your	 guardian
archangel.
You	are	talking	to	him	and	he	is	talking	to	you	and	you	don't	understand	you	do	it.	You
think	you	are	talking	to	yourself.	Yes,	we	are	in	contact	with	our	guardian	archangel.
And	sometimes,	when	we	overdo	it,	we	get	some	slaps.	As	the	stings	of	consciousness.
And	we	should	better	listen	to	what	this	holy	archangel	within	us	is	telling	us.
Because	it	is	he	who	is	warning	us	what	is	right	and	what	is	wrong.	So	it	is	not	difficult	to
come	in	contact	with	your	guardian	archangel.	Which	definitely	is	not	yourself.
Your	highness	is	different	from	your	holy	archangel	who	is	equified	to	you.	Loving	you.
And	ready	to	help	you.

Being	in	your	personality	even.	But	pure.	Holy.
Divine.	This	holy	archangel	of	yours	will	give	an	example.	It	is	like	a	mirror.
And	the	mirror	is	never	becoming	dirty	if	you	can	see	dirty	things	in	the	mirror.	Do	you
understand	what	I	mean?	You	put	something	dirty,	something	ugly	in	front	of	a	mirror.
You	see	it	there.
Reflect	that	that	is	not	making	the	mirror	dirty.	Put	another	thing	and	that	will	be	clean.
So	our	guardian	archangel	in	us	is	that	kind	of	mirror.
Reflecting	our	dirty	things.	Dirty	thoughts.	Dirty	emotions.
Yet	itself	being	clean.	And	so	clean	also	is	your	soul	ego	self.	Which	is	also	just	like	a
mirror.
So	don't	be	in	despair.	We	are	not	dirty	as	soul	ego	selves.	As	a	present	personality.
Yes.	But	there	is	enough	water	to	wash	ourselves.	To	wash	our	dirt.
Thanks	God.	He	has	given	us	much	water	to	clean	our	bodies.	And	he	has	given	us	much
mind	to	clean	our	personality.
It	is	up	to	us	to	decide	to	clean	it.	By	the	right	thought	and	thinking.	By	meditation.
Yes	of	course.	But	meditation	for	us	now	has	a	very	very	different	meaning	from	what
you	think	as	reading	books	from	the	east.	The	right	meditation	is	the	introspection	and
the	self	analysis.
And	 we	 don't	 have	 time	 to	 waste	 for	 other	 kinds	 of	 meditation	 which	 lead	 nowhere.
Nowhere.	Yes.
To	 the	 self	 realization	 as	 many	 claim.	 But	 you	 can	 reach	 the	 self	 realization	 by
introspection	in	a	safer	way.	In	a	better	way.
So.	What's	prayer?	Should	we	pray?	Of	course	we	should.	What's	prayer?	A	right	method
of	meditation.
Approaching	yourself	inwardly.	And	God	who	is	in	you	and	within	you.	Definitely.
But	what's	a	prayer?	Again.	Just	whispering	mechanically	and	thinking	many	many	other
things	this	time	you	are	just	reciting.	These	are	not	prayers.
We	 have	 another	 method	 to	 call	 it	 a	 concentric	 prayer.	 Which	 is	 concentration	 and
meditation	 just	 to	 know	 what	 is	 in	 that	 meditation	 we	 are	 going	 to	 do	 and	 we	 are
making.	And	a	meditation	is	a	prayer.

Prayer	where?	In	which	church?	In	our	heart.	Everybody	should	make	his	or	her	heart	the
holy	of	holies.	To	retire	in	it.
See	that	it	is	clean	and	purified.	And	have	in	it	everybody.	In	it.
Because	everyone	is	a	son	of	God.	As	a	spirit,	soul,	ego,	self.	Having	that	in	mind	we
cannot	hate	anybody.
We	must	love	everybody.	What	about	their	mistakes?	Their	behavior?	Maybe	too	hostile
for	us.	Attacking	us.
Even	killing	us.	These	are	simply	phenomena	in	time	and	in	certain	place.	And	seeing	in
all	your	incarnations	you	will	find	such	things.
And	what	is	the	aim	behind	it?	Both	sides	to	learn	to	love.	Seeing	I	have	seen	people	now
nearly	adoring	me.	Who	in	a	past	incarnation	had	killed	my	material	body.
Not	me.	Such	people.	Remembering	past	incarnations.
I	love	them.	I	always	loved	them.	I	never	have	stopped	loving	them.
Because	I	knew	things	even	in	my	previous	incarnations.	So	you	must	have	in	your	mind
that.	Weaknesses.
Hatreds.	Enmities.	Jealousies.
And	all	that.	Are	passing	shadows.	In	the	course	of	things.
In	what	you	call	time.	And	certain	place.	What	is	behind	it	is	the	precious	lessons	to	be
taken.
Which	is	love.	Much	love.	Impersonal	love.
Yes.	Maybe	the	best	definition	of	love.	You	can	find	it	in	the	epistles	of	St.	Paul	to	the
Corinthians.
I	read	it.	It	was	written	in	Greek	and	in	the	Greek	language.	Such	sweetness	in	the	whole
expressions.
Just	read	it.	The	impersonal	love.	So	this	is	the	lesson	everybody	has	to	learn	sooner	or
later.
Peacefully.	In	the	right	way.	Or	in	the	hard	way.
Of	collision.	Confusion.	And	misunderstandings.
This	is	the	most	serious	lesson	you	have	to	learn.	To	love	one	another.	As	he	had	loved
us.

His	love.	Yes.	Now	we'll	make	a	meditation.
Relax	completely.	I	said.	Our	heart.
By	saying	our	heart.	Do	I	mean.	A	handful	of	matter.
In	our	chest.	That's	the	heart.	The	material	heart.
The	gross	material	heart.	Do	I	mean	that?	Though	the	heart.	Is	the	only	organ.
In	the	material	body.	For	the	Holy	Spirit	and	the	Holy	Archangels.	To	talk	to	us.
Every	part	of	the	heart.	Is	their	voice.	Of	love	to	us.
To	prolong	the	life	of	our	material	body.	Which	is	not	our	material	body.	Yet.
Through	the	heart.	The	material	heart.	We	can	hear	the	voice	of	the	Holy	Spirit.
And	the	Holy	Archangels.	Creating.	And.
Making.	Good.	Everything	in	our	body.
Which	has.	To	be	made	good.	There	are	injuries.
In	the	material	body.	And	the	material	heart.	Is	that	organ.
For	the	circulation.	Of	the	blood.	Now	we	sit	from	another	side.
Our	material	heart	is	not	a	real	heart.	I	am.	Talking	about.
Because	our	heart.	Is	not	in	the	material	body.	But	it	is	in	our.
So	called	noetical	and	psychical	bodies.	Which	are	in	the	material	body.	Is	our	material
heart.
Coinciding.	With	the	heart	I	am	speaking.	About.
Which	is	the	heart.	Not	of	the	material	body.	But	of	our	personality.
Yes.	It	is	that	heart.	I	am	talking	about.
Which	is	a	center.	Of	energy.	It	is	the	center.
Of	our	emotions.	When	you	make	your	meditation.	On	the	so	called.
Psychical	heart.	Of	course	you	can	concentrate.	On	the	material	heart.
But	being.	Outside	in	the	way.	Of	the	material	body.
Leaving	the	material	body.	Sleeping	on	your	bed.	You	carry	with	you.

That	so	called.	Psychical	heart	of	yours.	Your	heart.
Which.	As	I	said.	You	are	sanctum.
The	holy	of	holies.	Will	worship.	God.
Life.	Everlasting	life.	So	make	that.
Realization.	You	can	have	that	heart.	But	before	you	must	have.
A	clean.	Material	heart.	Free	from	enmities.
Enemies.	Hostility.	And	weaknesses.
Yes.	You	must	have	that	concentration.	On	the	material	heart.
But	not	on	that.	Organ.	In	your	breast.
For	the	circulation	of	blood.	But	you	are.	Holy	of	holies.
The	center	of	your.	Selfhood.	Even	as	a	personality.
So	you	have	to	clean	there.	All	desires.	All	emotions.
Is	that	place.	Our	subconscious	mind.	Our	subconsciousness.
End	that.	But	not	only	that.	When	you	concentrate.
In	that	heart.	You	concentrate.	On	your.
Selfhood.	There	you	make	your	holy	of	holies.	That's	the	church.
You	must	not	avoid.	Going.	Entering.
Every	time	you	are	in	need.	To	enter	and	worship	God.	And	receive.
What	I	call.	The	self	realization.	And	life.
There.	In	that	heart.	You	will	find	your.
Selfhood.	A	God.	A	self.
Who	is	reconstructing.	Your	personality.	As	it	is.
Every	day.	In	every	24	hours.	You.
As	a	personality.	Man	or	a	woman.	Are	entering.
In	a	phenomenal.	Not	a	real.	Non	beingness.

You	enter.	In	a	sleep.	Without	dreams.
Even	for	some	minutes.	Even	if	you	are	living.	Partly	conscious.
Through	certain.	Moments.	Minutes.
In	that	state.	Of	non	beingness.	Yet	we	work.
We	wake	up	in	the	morning.	And	George	is	George.	Mary	is	Mary.
Who	is	reconstructing.	That	personality	of	yours.	That	selfhood	of	yours.
Again.	Just	meditate	on	this.	In	every	24.
Hours.	We	have	to	pass.	Once	or	more	times.
Through	that	state.	Of	non	existence.	As	a	personality.
And	again.	That	mysterious	self	of	ours.	Our	selfhood.
Is	reconstructing.	Our	personality.	With	all.
Its	vices.	Mistakes.	Desires.
Emotions.	And	thoughts.	As	it	was.
Before	going	to	sleep.	Even	that	present.	The	personality	for	your	selfhood.
Is	sacred.	And	that	personality	of	yours.	Is	supposed	to	receive.
The	impressions.	And	the	lessons.	So	we	must	have.
Must.	Think	seriously.	On	this	phenomenon.
Of	the	reconstruction.	Of	your	present	day	personality.	By	whom.
It's	that	self.	Your	selfhood.	You	have	to	find	out.
And	that	is	your.	Immortal.	Everlasting.
Spirit.	Soul.	Self.
Which	is	you.	Without	knowing	it.	And	for	your	sake.
Reconstructing.	Your	present.	Sinful	even	personality.
To	assimilate	it.	By	purifying	it.	To	itself.
Just	meditate.	On	this.	Selfhood	of	yours.

Your	soul.	Ego.	Now	put	the	question	to	yourself.
Being	in	my	material	body.	Who	am	I?	What	am	I?	By	what	right	do	I	live	in	this	material
body?	I	know	very	little	about	it.	Being	entitled	to	live	in	it.
And	call	it	mine.	I	repeat.	Knowing	very	little	about	my	material	body.
An	accident.	A	deep	wound.	Who	is	curing	it?	It	will	be	cured.
Definitely.	How	many	wounds	until	now	on	your	body.	Had	been	cured.
Who	is	curing	it?	You	as	a	personality.	Broken	bones.	Adjoining.
Who	is	doing	that?	In	your	material	body.	In	our	material	body.	The	same.
The	same.	Work	is	done	not	only.	In	the	gross	material	body.
But	in	all	your	bodies.	In	your	psychical	body.	In	your	medical	body.
Which	we	have.	By	meditation.	To	know.
And	use	it.	Being	it.	As	our	selfhood.
Our	real	self.	And	use	it.	Put	the	question	now	again.
What	am	I?	As	a	selfhood.	Who	am	I?	Am	I	really	George?	Or	Mary?	Or	that's	a	time	and
certain	place.	Shadow.
Living	shadow	though.	But	that	living	shadow.	Is	life.
Or	a	phenomenon	of	life.	What's	the	difference	between	a	phenomenon	of	life.	A	human
phenomenon	of	life.
And	life.	The	self.	The	spirit.
Ego	being.	The	mortal	God.	In	us.
Know.	Which	we	are.	Don't	take	the	place.
Of	the	shadow.	So	not	in	you.	It's	you.
Put	again	the	question.	What	am	I?	Who	really	am	I?	And	can	I	develop.	Raise	up	this.
Consciousness.	Which	is.	It's	expression	and	not	itself.
To	higher	and	higher	and	higher	levels.	Of	self-realization.	Unless.
I	can	do	that	I	cannot	claim	I	am	God.	But	we	can	do	it.	Because	we	are	God.

What	are	we	as.	Awareness.	Consciousness.
What's	 the	 difference	 between	 consciousness.	 And	 self-consciousness.	 Which	 we	 have
just	to.
Develop.	In	our	personality.	Don't	think.
That	things	are	easy.	Possible	they	are.	Easy.
They	are	not.	Why?	Because	we	make	them	difficult.	Not	that	they	are	really.
Difficult.	But	concentrating	our	personality.	Through	the	five	senses.
The	world	around	us.	On.	Matter.
We	make	things	difficult.	So	I	have	to	disentangle	ourselves.	From	our.
Interests.	In	matter.	No.
Because	 matter	 is	 also	 good.	 If	 it	 was	 not	 good	 God	 would	 not	 create	 it.	 I	 said
disentangle.
Not	throw	things	away.	Free	ourselves.	From	the	enchantment	of	matter.
That	makes	things	difficult.	And	I	think	that's	what	Buddhism	is	trying	to	teach.	Though
not	in	the	perfect	way.
As	Christianity	is	doing.	Who	am	I?	As	life	principle.	As	the	selfhood.
Keeping	this	material	body.	I'm	leaving	it.	Alive.
Am	I	the	only.	Entity.	Keeping	the	material	body	alive.
Personality.	Knowledge.	Or	wisdom.
Keeping	in	good	order	the	material	body.	Who	had	created	the	organs.	By	concentrating
seriously.
You	will	know	the	truth.	You	will	come	in	contact.	With	the	intelligences.
The	holy	archangels	of	the	elements.	Working	in	your	bodies.	As	you	are	slaves.
Loving	you.	And	what	do	we	offer	them?	Nothing.	What	do	they	offer	us?	Everything.
They	are	waiting.	They	are	loving	us.	What's	love	now	to	them?	For	us.
What	is	our	love?	Not	to	them.	To	the	others.	Our	fellow	men.
To	love.	Is	holy.	To	hate.

Is	devilish.	And	we	should	not	contaminate.	Even	our	material	heart.
With	devilish.	Poison.	Which	at	the	end	is	killing	us.
Killing	us	first.	Giving	to	the	material	body.	So	many.
So	many	illnesses.	Not	as	a	punishment.	As	the	course	of	things.
For	which	we	are	responsible.	Who	are	we?	Living	in	the	material	body.	And	how	do	we
use	that	material	body?	Higher	intelligences.
Have	created	and	are	keeping	it	in	good	order.	And	you	hear	the	voice	of	Joshua	the
Christ	saying.	Ye	are	gods.
And	sons	of	the	Almighty.	Enough.	I	suggest	that	every	day	you	should	concentrate	and
meditate.
Or	pray.	It's	the	same	thing.	Just	to	use	the	mind.
The	 greatest	 gift	 of	 God	 to	 the	 human	 beings.	 To	 reach	 the	 self-realization.	 And	 the
knowledge.
About	everything	around	us.	Undervaluing	nothing.	But	not	overvaluing	anything	again.
And	you	will	value	life.	Which	is	God.
