Thus	it	is	in	heaven,	give	us	this	day	our	daily	bread	and	forgive	us	our	transgressions	as
you	forgive	those	who	are	transgressing	against	us	and	lead	us	not	into	temptation	but
deliver	 us	 from	 evil	 for	 thine	 is	 the	 kingdom	 and	 the	 power	 and	 the	 glory	 forever
absolute	 infinite	 beingness	 God	 everlasting	 life	 love	 and	 mercy	 manifesting	 yourself	 in
yourself	 as	 the	 total	 wisdom	 and	 the	 all-mightiness	 enlighten	 our	 minds	 to	 understand
you	as	the	truth	clean	our	hearts	to	reflect	your	love	towards	you	and	towards	all	other
human	 beings.	 Amen	 What	 is	 always	 is	 the	 absolute	 infinite	 beingness	 the	 absolute
infinite	reality	life	the	everlasting	life	God	of	course	this	word	is	something	some	people
do	 not	 like	 whether	 they	 like	 it	 or	 not	 it	 is	 it	 is	 the	 absolute	 infinite	 reality	 it	 is	 the
absolute	 infinite	 selfhood	 now	 what	 exists	 now	 there	 are	 two	 different	 things	 being	 and
existing	 being	 is	 everlasting	 eternal	 existing	 it	 is	 something	 that	 appears	 and	 goes	 so	 i
have	 two	 states	 beingness	 and	 existence	 in	 beingness	 is	 the	 absolute	 infinite	 being	 the
incomprehensible	 omnipresent	 omniscient	 omnipotent	 reality	 if	 we	 don't	 like	 the	 word
God	it's	just	the	same	now	what	exists	this	characteristic	one	of	the	main	characteristics
of	 this	 absolute	 infinite	 beingness	 is	 its	 will	 pleasure	 to	 manifest	 itself	 in	 itself	 the
manifestation	 just	 this	 will	 pleasure	 makes	 causes	 the	 emanation	 from	 the	 absolute
infinite	 beingness	 of	 the	 mind	 the	 mind	 is	 not	 God	 this	 emanation	 from	 the	 absolute
infinite	 beingness	 through	 the	 mind	 by	 means	 of	 the	 mind	 the	 will	 pleasure	 of	 the
absolute	 infinite	 beingness	 will	 create	 now	 the	 words	 of	 existence	 many	 the	 word	 of
existence	is	not	only	the	material	plane	the	cross	material	plane	there	are	other	words	of
existence	the	psychical	planes	the	noetical	the	noetic	so	the	absolute	infinite	beingness
in	 its	 will	 pleasure	 to	 express	 itself	 in	 itself	 causes	 the	 emanation	 of	 what	 you	 call	 the
mind	now	they	make	a	great	mistake	most	people	and	churches	thinking	that	the	mind
is	the	holy	spirit	no	it	isn't	the	mind	is	the	means	of	expression	the	holy	spirit	is	the	actor
behind	the	mind	expressing	its	total	wisdom	this	is	the	point	so	we	have	in	eternity	the
everlasting	 life	 caught	 one	 god	 not	 many	 gods	 one	 god	 of	 course	 there	 are	 other	 gods
but	they	are	expressions	of	the	one	god	will	not	give	them	just	that	great	word	splendid
work	 what	 called	 the	 god	 so	 have	 the	 absolute	 infinite	 beingness	 in	 it	 there	 are	 billions
and	 billions	 beyond	 number	 beings	 beingness	 quality	 beings	 now	 the	 absolute	 infinite
selfhood	now	spirit	beings	expressing	a	self	part	of	the	selfhood	so	this	absolute	infinite
beingness	 in	 its	 expression	 as	 the	 selfhood	 is	 what	 we	 will	 call	 the	 locus	 locus	 from	 the
greek	word	logos	means	expression	manifestation	we	don't	have	a	second	now	god	have
an	 expression	 of	 the	 same	 absolute	 infinite	 beingness	 but	 now	 expressing	 manifesting
the	 absolute	 beingness	 selfhood	 now	 we	 see	 another	 aspect	 of	 god	 the	 selfhood	 what
about	the	holy	spirit	the	holy	spirit	is	not	expressing	the	selfhood	yes	in	a	different	way
in	what	i	will	call	consciousness	by	studying	all	these	things	we'll	have	to	separate	those
two	 states	 conscious	 self	 and	 consciousness	 because	 by	 introspection	 meditation	 you
will	 find	 this	 difference	 between	 conscious	 selfhood	 and	 simply	 consciousness	 but	 this
needs	 study	 now	 we	 said	 in	 this	 absolute	 infinite	 beingness	 there	 are	 beings	 beyond
numbers	we	can	call	them	gods	but	not	god	the	one	god	they	are	in	it	so	in	the	absolute

infinite	 beingness	 these	 beings	 spirit	 egos	 are	 all	 similar	 there	 is	 no	 distinction	 but	 the
time	 that	 time	 was	 always	 in	 certain	 parts	 of	 the	 universes	 when	 the	 real	 pleasure	 of
infinite	 beingness	 is	 to	 manifest	 itself	 in	 itself	 certain	 of	 these	 beings	 get	 their	 own
characteristics	 they	 classify	 themselves	 into	 what	 they	 call	 their	 orders	 the	 archangelic
orders	 according	 to	 the	 divine	 plan	 and	 the	 total	 wisdom	 which	 is	 in	 them	 to	 start	 the
work	 in	 the	 creation	 so	 we	 have	 what	 we	 call	 the	 archangelic	 orders	 the	 michaels	 not
one	michael	the	raphael's	the	gabriel's	the	uriel's	and	other	orders	how	is	that	who	can
say	 who	 can	 say	 these	 divine	 things	 now	 you	 have	 a	 prism	 you	 see	 the	 light	 you	 know
what's	the	light	then	you	see	immediately	colors	why	who	can	say	why	how	is	it	that	the
white	color	is	giving	me	the	seven	colors	in	a	prism	that	has	called	this	the	real	pleasure
of	 the	 infinite	 beingness	 in	 expressing	 itself	 but	 why	 i	 have	 these	 seven	 colors	 now
nobody	 can	 say	 what	 we	 can	 only	 say	 is	 that	 we	 can	 see	 them	 distinctly	 through	 their
work	 in	 getting	 and	 a	 role	 of	 themselves	 calling	 them	 michaels	 gabriel's	 rafael's	 uriel's
now	what	is	the	work	of	these	archangels	of	these	gods	of	these	beings	spirit	beings	to
express	manifest	the	real	pleasure	of	the	absolute	infinite	beingness	in	the	creation	now
are	they	servants	to	obey	orders	or	instructions	no	when	the	absolute	infinite	beingness
starts	vibrating	they	co-vibrate	to	this	absolute	infinite	beingness	expressing	themselves
in	 this	 vibration	 that's	 why	 i	 say	 there	 is	 only	 one	 god	 and	 in	 that	 absolute	 infinite
beingness	 god	 are	 these	 entities	 let	 us	 call	 them	 entities	 beings	 expressing	 its	 will	 and
their	will	which	is	not	different	i'll	put	another	words	these	beings	the	archangels	are	in
full	attunement	to	the	absolute	infinite	beingness	and	attunement	with	it	being	one	with
it	so	in	the	god	of	beingness	there	is	not	distinction	it	is	one	absolute	infinite	beingness
it's	 one	 absolute	 infinite	 reality	 it	 is	 god	 but	 now	 in	 the	 will	 pleasure	 of	 god	 to	 express
itself	 in	 itself	 then	 i	 see	 the	 phenomena	 the	 first	 phenomena	 the	 classification	 of	 this
spirit	 beings	 in	 their	 orders	 to	 create	 so	 we	 have	 now	 the	 words	 of	 the	 creation	 i	 said
from	 the	 moment	 the	 absolute	 infinite	 beingness	 which	 is	 always	 it	 was	 always	 since
now	it	all	it	will	always	be	in	it	and	in	the	space	around	us	emanates	it	should	pre-exist	of
course	so	that	it	will	emanate	the	mind	as	the	means	by	which	everything	will	be	created
so	 everything	 which	 had	 been	 created	 is	 the	 mind	 matter	 the	 stones	 the	 rocks	 the
crystals	everything	is	mind	solid	so	we	have	the	mind	now	as	we	can	understand	it	with
our	 human	 intelligence	 in	 various	 states	 of	 existence	 depending	 on	 the	 motion	 or
vibrations	or	frequencies	of	the	vibrations	so	what	makes	things	solid	liquid	conscious	or
something	 else	 is	 the	 rate	 of	 their	 vibrations	 the	 frequencies	 of	 their	 vibrations	 the
vibrations	 of	 the	 mind	 so	 now	 we	 see	 another	 aspect	 of	 the	 infinite	 being	 motion
movement	 vibrations	 are	 these	 things	 characteristics	 of	 life	 definitely	 can	 live	 exist
without	 movement	 without	 motion	 without	 growing	 no	 so	 the	 main	 characteristic	 of	 life
of	god	is	movement	motion	in	itself	how	you	can	say	human	intelligence	is	not	so	strong
to	 comprehend	 this	 divine	 states	 of	 beingness	 now	 what	 do	 we	 as	 human	 beings	 now
have	in	hand	to	work	with	the	mind	of	course	studying	its	qualities	you	have	the	mind	as
matter	it	is	our	material	world	around	us	the	physical	world	it's	matter	it	is	the	mind	solid
and	it's	our	material	body	of	course	to	study	which	is	again	mind	solid	so	the	solidity	now
of	 the	 mind	 again	 is	 in	 various	 kinds	 of	 vibrations	 the	 bones	 the	 stones	 the	 flesh

something	 more	 just	 tangible	 and	 all	 that	 are	 different	 they	 are	 still	 solid	 so	 we	 can
study	 now	 the	 various	 degrees	 of	 solidity	 or	 the	 various	 i	 would	 call	 the	 stages	 of
frequencies	of	the	mind	of	the	vibration	these	are	realities	which	the	orthodox	science	is
studying	now	and	we	can	study	it	so	we	have	to	live	now	in	the	material	plane	the	world
of	 the	 solids	 in	 a	 material	 body	 composed	 of	 all	 that	 exists	 in	 the	 material	 plane	 and
composed	 of	 what	 else	 what	 is	 this	 material	 world	 consisting	 of	 now	 by	 study	 we	 reach
the	 work	 of	 the	 archangels	 the	 lords	 of	 the	 elements	 now	 we	 study	 mind	 from	 another
point	of	view	because	i	said	using	the	mind	the	holy	archangels	in	all	its	aspects	they	are
creating	 so	 i	 can	 now	 see	 the	 work	 of	 these	 archangels	 in	 handling	 the	 elements	 that
appear	by	their	own	vibrations	becoming	the	lords	of	those	elements	the	element	of	the
etheric	 vitality	 the	 raphiles	 the	 element	 of	 fire	 light	 and	 heat	 the	 element	 of	 the	 water
and	the	element	of	the	cross	matter	we	can	see	this	for	states	of	the	mind	as	elements	i
repeat	 it	 everything	 is	 mind	 in	 various	 states	 of	 existence	 but	 coming	 from	 where	 from
where	are	these	elements	are	coming	there	must	be	and	another	state	from	which	all	of
them	 must	 thrive	 we	 see	 these	 archangels	 and	 they	 are	 separate	 different	 work	 the
different	 work	 of	 the	 one	 from	 the	 other	 but	 who	 is	 above	 all	 the	 lord	 of	 manifestation
the	lord	of	the	selfhood	the	absolute	infinite	beingness	we	call	the	locus	which	is	now	the
element	of	this	locus	we	can't	give	it	a	name	yet	it	is	a	state	to	be	studied	it	is	the	state
from	which	all	the	elements	are	coming	are	born	emanate	emanate	we	don't	have	greek
name	or	any	other	name	in	the	european	languages	but	the	hindus	call	it	akasha	now	if
we	 now	 analyze	 the	 word	 akasha	 which	 is	 both	 sanskrit	 and	 old	 egyptian	 it	 means	 it
means	the	will	pleasure	of	god	as	truth	ka	means	will	pressure	sa	means	the	truth	so	if
we	go	back	to	analyze	this	god	that	means	the	will	of	god	so	even	now	they	don't	give	us
any	characteristic	with	this	word	even	the	hindus	or	the	old	egyptian	philosophy	but	it	is
it	 must	 be	 a	 source	 it	 must	 be	 a	 cause	 from	 where	 all	 these	 holy	 archangels	 pass
through	and	express	their	own	element	now	creation	we	see	from	where	all	the	creation
is	coming	but	what	can	we	see	by	observation	close	observation	that	behind	everything
existing	 created	 as	 a	 phenomenon	 of	 life	 is	 what	 i	 would	 call	 the	 total	 wisdom	 the
intelligence	the	purpose	of	course	this	is	not	a	characteristic	of	the	mind	but	of	the	one
behind	the	mind	expressing	itself	that's	why	i	say	the	holy	spirit	is	not	the	mind	but	the
mind	is	the	mean	by	which	the	holy	spirit	expresses	the	infinite	beingness	and	selfhood
and	  consciousness	  because	  i	  can	  see	  which	  i	  can	  study	  what	  i	  call	  instinctive
consciousness	in	everything	in	every	phenomenon	of	life	in	the	vegetable	kingdom	in	the
animal	kingdom	even	studying	the	cross	matter	in	the	crystals	in	the	metals	you	say	in
the	 metals	 what	 kind	 of	 instinctive	 subconsciousness	 you	 can	 see	 i	 can	 see	 the
sensitivity	  the	  iron	  is	  getting	  ill	  become	  rusty	  and	  other	  metals	  have	  different
characteristics	 another	 metal	 passes	 what	 i	 call	 electricity	 and	 others	 do	 not	 do	 it	 by
observation	 we	 see	 what	 i	 call	 now	 also	 the	 sensitivity	 is	 there	 any	 other	 work	 yes	 so
everything	is	under	laws	and	in	order	everything	in	order	but	not	similar	according	to	the
needs	  and	  according	  to	  the	  circumstances	  but	  i	  can	  see	  it	  in	  that	  instinctive
consciousness	in	the	vegetable	kingdom	i'll	see	the	thorns	of	the	rose	bushes	why	not	to
be	eaten	up	by	the	animals	i	see	the	thorns	all	the	kinds	of	captive	very	different	ways

according	 to	 the	 circumstances	 and	 the	 place	 they	 are	 growing	 so	 it's	 not	 difficult	 by
observation	just	to	see	this	total	wisdom	of	the	lords	of	manifestation	and	in	the	human
beings	yes	in	our	material	body	i	said	yesterday	how	many	really	do	know	what	is	going
on	in	their	material	body	now	let's	go	get	a	book	on	anatomy	to	see	how	you	would	know
that	in	the	chest	there	are	two	lungs	and	there	is	the	heart	and	there	are	the	glands	and
the	intestines	this	and	that	unless	you	had	a	book	on	anatomy	somebody	would	tell	you
how	you	would	know	it	and	unless	scientists	by	making	operations	how	they	would	know
it	 yet	 all	 those	 organs	 in	 the	 material	 body	 even	 of	 an	 aboriginal	 of	 an	 illiterate	 man
living	in	the	desert	and	in	the	woods	is	working	and	functioning	properly	maybe	i	would
say	that	the	health	of	those	people	is	much	much	better	than	ours	all	of	them	have	eyes
well	preserved	to	see	as	we	have	at	all	organs	so	who	can	deny	that	life	of	the	material
body	is	not	the	product	of	the	wisdom	of	higher	intelligences	which	higher	intelligences
they	are	conscious	of	the	elements	analyzing	the	body	you	find	the	solids	find	the	bones
corresponding	to	the	clay	to	the	earth	you'll	find	the	liquids	you'll	find	the	fire	you'll	find
the	 ether	 everything	 whatever	 exists	 in	 the	 universes	 not	 only	 the	 material	 in	 the
psychical	in	the	neurotic	exists	in	a	human	being	in	your	human	body	so	by	observation
and	 studying	 and	 the	 introspection	 you	 reach	 the	 relative	 truth	 concerning	 everything
you	are	meditating	on	by	using	the	mind	now	we	said	the	mind	the	mind	is	the	greatest
gift	 given	 to	 man	 to	 a	 human	 being	 to	 that	 personality	 the	 self	 of	 a	 human	 being	 the
mind	is	the	greatest	gift	given	by	god	what	about	our	real	self	our	spirit	soul	do	we	get
the	mind	from	any	source	from	the	absolute	infinite	beingness	no	since	we	are	gods	we
have	the	same	nature	and	characteristics	of	the	absolute	infinite	beingness	and	the	mind
emanates	when	we	express	as	spirit	soul	beings	the	real	pleasure	of	expression	but	now
we	as	human	beings	living	in	a	material	body	having	our	inner	nature	god	being	gods	we
need	it	from	our	father	because	we	are	much	much	inferior	to	our	real	divine	nature	they
said	 yesterday	 we	 have	 a	 double	 personality	 and	 individuality	 i	 will	 not	 call	 personality
the	 divine	 state	 but	 individuality	 selfhood	 but	 to	 reach	 to	 this	 truth	 we	 must	 work	 very
hard	 in	 introspection	 meditation	 reasoning	 and	 i	 will	 come	 to	 what	 conclusion	 who	 is
doing	this	work	that's	not	this	point	who	is	doing	this	work	our	self	our	divine	spirit	soul
ego	or	our	human	personality	is	doing	it	definitely	our	present	day	human	personality	is
doing	it	what	for	to	know	the	truth	which	truth	which	is	in	us	how	is	it	in	us	just	not	this
point	 any	 human	 being	 trying	 to	 learn	 something	 to	 know	 something	 when	 he	 or	 she
knows	it	he	or	she	feels	that	he	always	or	she	already	knew	it	the	disability	of	knowing	it
means	that	it	was	in	us	otherwise	how	we	could	know	things	why	do	animals	around	us
the	dogs	the	lambs	cannot	know	things	as	we	know	them	because	in	reality	everything	is
in	 our	 divine	 inner	 self	 whose	 shadow	 is	 our	 present	 day	 personality	 so	 just	 this	 thing
shows	 that	 we	 are	 also	 divine	 even	 as	 human	 beings	 living	 in	 our	 material	 body	 and	 in
our	other	bodies	now	i	say	when	you	start	meditation	we'll	see	everything	under	the	light
of	 a	 reason	 and	 you	 can	 reach	 to	 that	 by	 burning	 whys	 which	 request	 an	 answer	 from
where	from	us	and	from	other	intelligences	now	studying	the	material	body	our	material
body	we	knowing	nearly	nothing	about	the	material	body	but	we	can	study	and	know	we
see	the	question	yes	i	see	this	material	body	i	touch	it	hands	legs	everything	but	there	is

in	 them	 the	 creation	 going	 on	 growing	 circulation	 of	 the	 blood	 the	 creation	 of	 liquids	 in
the	body	i	am	breathing	and	this	body	of	mine	is	growing	in	an	order	in	harmony	which
must	have	behind	it	the	reason	why	now	the	material	body	is	tangible	now	i	can	touch	it
but	 there	 must	 be	 a	 mode	 in	 which	 and	 through	 which	 this	 material	 body	 must	 grow
what	 we	 find	 that	 every	 molecule	 every	 atom	 everything	 in	 the	 material	 body	 every
organ	 must	 have	 its	 mold	 is	 that	 the	 word	 mold	 means	 the	 place	 to	 get	 its	 shape	 then
we	 see	 the	 whole	 no	 material	 body	 has	 the	 more	 to	 call	 it	 the	 human	 body	 growing
growing	 every	 hair	 is	 growing	 mathematically	 why	 we	 can	 see	 causes	 laws	 and	 effects
this	 is	 our	 life	 why	 we	 must	 find	 the	 reasons	 why	 now	 studying	 the	 material	 body	 i	 will
reach	to	certain	conclusions	this	material	body	i'm	living	in	is	not	myself	that	they	call	it
mine	 or	 my	 house	 or	 as	 expressing	 myself	 in	 it	 others	 are	 working	 in	 it	 the	 archangels
others	 are	 keeping	 it	 in	 good	 order	 for	 me	 another	 burning	 why	 why	 do	 they	 keep	 this
material	body	in	this	form	in	this	shape	so	that	i	will	live	in	it	then	i	see	it	is	different	the
life	of	the	body	from	my	life	as	a	self	then	i	start	just	understanding	how	to	respect	life
because	 there's	 much	 much	 much	 work	 to	 be	 done	 so	 that	 a	 human	 body	 should	 be	 in
good	order	and	in	good	health	for	our	sake	to	express	ourselves	in	it	and	live	and	call	it
ours	 now	 we	 come	 to	 another	 point	 i	 am	 not	 the	 material	 body	 i	 am	 living	 in	 mama	 in
this	material	body	i	can	call	it	mine	feel	it	as	part	of	myself	but	as	we	said	yesterday	the
material	 bodies	 of	 every	 man	 and	 every	 woman	 is	 the	 same	 while	 the	 personalities	 are
different	no	one	can	find	two	persons	men	or	women	the	same	this	so-called	personality
is	 different	 and	 that	 is	 your	 real	 self	 in	 the	 words	 of	 existence	 you	 are	 real	 self	 in	 the
words	of	existence	but	the	real	self	in	other	domain	it's	not	this	it	is	your	highness	now
we	 must	 study	 now	 this	 personality	 of	 ours	 so	 we	 get	 now	 double	 existence	 the	 one
criticizing	 starting	 to	 know	 and	 the	 object	 which	 is	 ourselves	 again	 to	 be	 known	 this	 is
the	great	work	we	have	to	do	in	starting	studying	our	personality	there	is	no	other	way	of
what	 we	 call	 psychical	 or	 spiritual	 development	 human	 beings	 around	 us	 by	 thousands
are	 living	 either	 instinctively	 or	 subconsciously	 they	 have	 never	 developed	 in	 their
personality	what	i	would	call	self-consciousness	which	is	what	we	need	first	of	all	develop
the	  real	  reasoning	  consciousness	  and	  then	  find	  what	  we	  are	  as	  the	  real	  self-
consciousness	 now	 start	 studying	 it	 what	 is	 desire	 what	 are	 emotions	 of	 course	 before
starting	 this	 kind	 of	 study	 we	 must	 study	 what	 is	 our	 etheric	 double	 another	 very	 vast
field	 of	 study	 the	 means	 we	 will	 use	 in	 living	 a	 proper	 life	 so	 but	 it	 doesn't	 matter	 from
where	we	start	they	both	run	parallel	what	is	desire	what	creates	in	us	the	desire	of	what
at	 the	 beginning	 of	 knowing	 what	 it	 is	 that	 of	 liking	 it	 or	 having	 it	 of	 possessing	 it	 are
stages	 which	 need	 to	 be	 studied	 but	 the	 common	 people	 are	 under	 these	 influences
without	just	studying	because	they	are	not	self-conscious	why	should	i	have	it	what	for	i
must	have	it	what's	the	value	of	it	to	me	so	working	blindly	in	what	i	call	desire	the	first
thing	a	man	has	to	study	and	know	is	what	is	desire	and	to	which	degree	he	is	influenced
by	 this	 desire	 i	 will	 help	 you	 suppose	 you	 have	 lived	 of	 course	 most	 of	 you	 of	 us	 have
lived	in	the	past	in	past	times	means	of	communication	may	be	an	ass	or	by	feet	or	just
a	 little	 cat	 drawn	 by	 an	 animal	 of	 course	 seeing	 at	 that	 time	 these	 means	 of	 transport
and	communication	could	you	dream	having	anything	more	than	an	ass	a	cow	or	just	a

cat	to	take	you	somewhere	could	you	dream	at	that	time	of	having	a	mercedes	or	a	bmw
or	a	helicopter	it	didn't	exist	so	you	could	not	just	wish	or	desire	having	something	you
didn't	know	later	something	more	came	to	our	life	and	more	and	more	and	more	and	you
have	 today	 so	 many	 things	 how	 do	 you	 have	 all	 those	 things	 at	 that	 time	 it	 was	 just	 to
have	a	little	hut	made	of	wood	or	we	just	came	out	of	the	cage	or	build	we	store	a	little
house	 now	 we're	 not	 satisfied	 with	 it	 we	 now	 want	 a	 nice	 house	 just	 like	 a	 palace	 or	 a
nice	flat	big	comfortable	flat	nobody	at	that	time	could	dream	having	all	these	things	but
now	 we	 want	 to	 have	 them	 because	 we	 know	 them	 you	 have	 the	 desire	 of	 having	 it
having	 it	 living	 in	 it	 only	 or	 possessing	 it	 to	 be	 mine	 a	 flat	 a	 house	 why	 not	 10	 houses
why	not	just	big	constructions	so	now	we	come	just	to	study	what's	desire	desire	was	the
same	always	in	the	past	now	and	it	will	be	in	future	maybe	in	future	human	beings	will
desire	having	possessing	knowing	things	that	you	don't	know	now	which	are	not	existing
now	 so	 it	 is	 not	 the	 things	 the	 objects	 that	 concern	 us	 but	 to	 study	 desire	 what	 really
creates	 in	 a	 human	 being	 in	 a	 person	 the	 desire	 access	 of	 knowing	 hoarding	 having
possessing	 maybe	 one	 is	 feeling	 safe	 having	 maybe	 maybe	 there	 are	 other	 reasons
maybe	 greediness	 maybe	 you	 have	 to	 study	 all	 these	 states	 of	 desire	 i	 say	 doesn't
matter	what	the	object	is	to	be	studied	the	desire	now	second	step	this	desire	appears	in
a	human	being	by	seeing	through	these	five	senses	certain	things	outside	of	our	material
body	and	of	our	self	a	jewel	something	a	book	a	house	possessions	and	we	want	to	call
them	 ours	 this	 is	 mine	 i	 want	 it	 mine	 first	 we	 study	 the	 desire	 then	 the	 effects	 of	 the
desire	 are	 the	 effects	 of	 the	 desire	 the	 same	 to	 everybody	 no	 knowing	 things	 it's	 for
everybody	 the	 same	 through	 the	 senses	 through	 the	 special	 decide	 so	 it	 are	 different
now	 we	 must	 study	 why	 i	 am	 affected	 having	 something	 that	 really	 somebody	 is	 not
interested	in	that	by	observation	and	meditation	we	must	come	to	conclusion	then	what
is	the	influence	of	this	interest	on	us	and	on	the	other	people	i	want	to	have	it	and	i	say
yes	 i	 will	 have	 it	 sometime	 how	 shall	 i	 have	 it	 that	 we	 are	 using	 the	 mind	 until	 now	 we
have	 what	 i	 call	 desire	 here	 is	 what	 is	 wrong	 we	 enslave	 the	 mind	 to	 the	 desire	 that's
what	we	are	all	doing	every	day	enslaving	the	master	to	the	desire	which	should	be	the
slave	and	not	the	master	of	the	mind	and	enslaving	the	mind	to	the	desire	where	is	this
desire	 leading	 us	 to	 even	 to	 the	 crime	 thoughtlessly	 just	 i	 will	 have	 it	 at	 all	 cost	 even
killing	 so	 the	 desire	 has	 certain	 effects	 on	 human	 beings	 we	 must	 study	 these	 effects
and	especially	in	us	in	our	personality	and	we'll	see	that	the	greatest	devil	torturing	the
world	is	desire	and	especially	unbridled	desire	causing	so	much	disaster	what	should	we
do	 now	 separate	 the	 desire	 from	 the	 thought	 and	 now	 the	 thought	 or	 reason	 will
dominate	over	those	things	i	call	desire	why	should	i	do	all	this	work	to	study	and	learn
the	 nature	 of	 the	 elementals	 i	 am	 creating	 this	 way	 you	 are	 studying	 the	 elementals
because	 i	 said	 in	 a	 lesson	 something	 that	 draws	 your	 attention	 without	 even	 thinking
much	on	it	something	that	attracts	you	you	are	thinking	about	it	you	like	it	and	all	these
things	 is	 creating	 an	 elemental	 and	 the	 elemental	 has	 a	 form	 and	 that	 the	 form	 we	 are
giving	 it	 resembling	 the	 thing	 that	 creates	 the	 desire	 or	 it	 gets	 a	 form	 of	 its	 own	 of	 its
own	 nature	 from	 what	 this	 form	 is	 getting	 its	 power	 now	 because	 this	 form	 has	 energy
and	 power	 definitely	 from	 desire	 the	 stronger	 the	 desire	 the	 greater	 the	 force	 in	 it	 and

the	greater	the	energy	and	from	where	is	this	energy	coming	from	the	mind	because	we
said	 everything	 is	 the	 mind	 so	 we	 are	 making	 the	 great	 mistake	 i	 say	 in	 creating
elementals	we	call	them	desire	thought	forms	of	enslaving	this	thought	to	the	emotion	to
the	desire	while	you	should	do	something	else	sober	thinking	right	thinking	checking	the
desires	classifying	them	to	necessities	which	have	to	be	satisfied	and	something	which	is
not	 so	 necessary	 having	 and	 how	 to	 use	 now	 the	 mind	 as	 right	 thought	 so	 we	 classify
now	the	elementals	into	emotional	thought	forms	and	to	pure	thought	forms	the	seeker
of	 the	 truth	 should	 create	 or	 revitalize	 from	 the	 psychical	 plane	 these	 thought	 forms
these	 thought	 forms	 are	 constructive	 negative	 the	 desire	 thought	 forms	 of	 course	 it
depends	upon	their	quality	i	cannot	call	all	of	them	bad	or	evil	but	most	of	them	at	least
80	 percent	 are	 injurious	 they	 don't	 offer	 anything	 to	 the	 fellow	 who	 is	 creating	 them	 or
revitalizing	 them	 or	 to	 the	 others	 all	 around	 us	 so	 we	 should	 with	 open	 mind	 see	 the
nature	of	these	elementals	because	the	sum	total	of	these	elementals	is	composing	our
personality	that's	why	i	said	that	our	personality	is	not	our	real	self	it's	our	shadow	so	the
nature	of	our	personality	is	the	sum	total	of	the	elementals	good	or	evil	which	we	have
created	 or	 revitalized	 what	 another	 name	 will	 give	 to	 this	 group	 of	 the	 elementals
composing	 our	 personality	 the	 egoism	 the	 egos	 of	 the	 personality	 so	 the	 egos	 of	 a
person	is	of	the	same	nature	with	his	personality	or	her	personality	now	studying	who	is
studying	that	part	of	the	personality	i'm	calling	egoism	or	in	my	personality	my	inner	self
now	 helping	 my	 present	 personality	 to	 help	 it	 assimilate	 itself	 with	 the	 self	 and	 reject
what	is	time	and	place	illusions	now	here's	the	critical	point	you	are	trying	as	a	present
the	personality	and	then	ego	self	also	but	in	every	step	you	are	doing	you	are	called	self
the	 egoism	 which	 is	 not	 our	 self	 will	 present	 objecting	 because	 he	 has	 his	 own	 life	 the
elementals	have	their	own	life	not	only	their	existence	but	their	own	life	independent	life
from	 your	 i-ness	 will	 appear	 immediately	 because	 all	 this	 time	 he	 was	 masquerading
himself	being	you	and	you	are	slumbering	in	it	without	just	noticing	this	deception	by	the
time	 and	 place	 egoism	 was	 exercised	 on	 you	 that	 great	 deception	 now	 i'll	 give	 an
example	so	that	you	will	understand	it	you	are	a	judge	i	had	such	stories	and	instances
many	of	course	a	judge	has	created	a	kind	of	present	day	self	or	personality	believing	to
his	 knowledge	 to	 his	 title	 to	 his	 profession	 and	 we	 see	 that	 every	 human	 being	 has	 an
egoism	according	to	what	he	believes	he	is	in	this	society	education	money	power	so	we
see	that	fellow	getting	out	tricky	fellows	create	just	troubles	and	somebody	a	poor	man
being	offended	that	maybe	that	judge	expressed	something	which	was	not	good	for	him
he	doesn't	like	it	and	he	will	say	to	the	judge	why	do	you	behave	in	this	way	saying	this
and	this	and	this	against	me	because	the	judge	maybe	he	never	said	such	things	tricky
persons	are	playing	these	tricks	the	judge	feels	offended	who	is	that	poor	fellow	coming
in	 my	 way	 now	 just	 going	 to	 my	 office	 creating	 he	 would	 insult	 him	 you	 could	 ask	 the
fellow	 go	 away	 why	 you	 come	 near	 me	 and	 then	 we	 see	 things	 becoming	 worse	 and
worse	i	had	these	cases	now	if	that	judge	will	start	and	think	that	this	fellow	to	behave	in
this	 way	 must	 have	 a	 reason	 let	 me	 search	 for	 it	 come	 you	 good	 man	 what	 makes	 you
behave	in	this	way	and	then	everything	will	be	all	right	no	i	have	never	said	this	thing	on
the	contrary	i	like	you	you	are	a	good	man	and	everything	was	but	the	voice	of	the	judge

revolted	 who	 is	 he	 just	 to	 stand	 in	 my	 way	 this	 morning	 maybe	 he	 thinks	 that	 he	 was
right	 to	 say	 certain	 heavy	 words	 to	 this	 poor	 man	 going	 away	 i	 had	 this	 case	 then	 of
course	 when	 that	 judge	 came	 to	 me	 said	 you	 are	 wrong	 your	 honor	 because	 he	 was	 a
member	of	the	circus	why	who	is	he	to	come	in	my	way	this	morning	i	said	you	care	okay
whether	 you	 are	 a	 judge	 or	 a	 grocer	 or	 anybody	 else	 you	 are	 you	 and	 you	 have	 just	 to
use	a	reason	you	should	say	why	this	fellow	came	that	morning	shouting	instead	of	just
shouting	 yourself	 see	 him	 with	 kindness	 with	 a	 smile	 and	 look	 like	 you	 are	 a	 good	 man
who	really	makes	you	feel	like	that	or	behave	and	put	things	in	order	but	there	is	not	but
it's	your	egoism	when	he	was	looking	at	me	he	said	i	should	do	that	and	that	but	i	said
cut	your	egoism	now	from	the	here	it	is	presenting	itself	and	it	is	the	right	time	that	will
catch	 him	 that	 bad	 and	 bad	 is	 your	 egoism	 coming	 to	 give	 reasons	 you	 don't	 have	 a
reason	 you	 should	 use	 the	 mind	 instead	 of	 feeling	 wounded	 or	 offended	 and	 attacking
because	 being	 a	 member	 of	 the	 circus	 he	 understood	 it	 was	 a	 very	 precious	 lesson	 to
catch	 his	 sequence	 who	 is	 that	 you	 that	 egoism	 so	 you	 must	 have	 in	 your	 mind	 that
every	one	of	you	has	a	devil	inside	you	hidden	your	egoism	i	can't	say	that	at	all	times
that	egoism	is	evil	but	it	has	something	evil	in	it	which	is	the	feeling	of	being	offended	or
humiliated	and	just	having	this	feeling	what	might	not	happen	kicking	beating	killing	so
the	 worst	 devil	 is	 the	 feeling	 of	 feeling	 offended	 or	 humiliated	 in	 reality	 nobody	 can	 do
that	to	you	you	are	doing	it	to	yourself	by	listening	to	what	the	other	say	and	the	ego	is
deceiving	 you	 so	 the	 first	 thing	 of	 a	 seeker	 of	 the	 truth	 is	 to	 be	 awakened	 towards
circumstances	circumstances	for	everything	there	must	be	a	reason	behind	it	there	is	a
reason	 behind	 it	 find	 it	 correctly	 think	 now	 your	 egoism	 will	 tell	 you	 getting	 up	 in	 the
morning	oh	there	are	so	many	bad	people	already	or	around	i'll	come	just	with	a	serious
face	and	like	that	tell	him	no	that's	not	my	decision	is	different	i	will	have	always	a	sweet
smile	on	my	lips	going	out	and	say	good	morning	to	no	one	and	i'll	know	this	hotel	is	not
safe	 so	 it	 is	 not	 difficult	 to	 find	 in	 your	 personality	 the	 devil	 ego	 is	 and	 detect	 also	 by
reasoning	 that	 that's	 not	 me	 you	 can	 find	 yourself	 and	 that's	 the	 most	 precious	 thing
your	highness	in	this	way	by	judging	and	reasoning	you	reach	the	first	stages	of	your	so-
called	 self-consciousness	 you	 know	 yourself	 even	 as	 a	 present-day	 personality	 the	 less
we	 know	 ourselves	 as	 time	 and	 place	 present	 the	 personality	 how	 we	 should	 enter
assimilate	that	self	to	our	inner	self	and	know	who	we	really	are	so	the	one	who	should
know	 who	 he	 really	 is	 the	 present-day	 personality	 because	 your	 inner	 self	 knows
everything	 why	 because	 according	 to	 jesus	 christ	 that's	 the	 part	 of	 your	 soul	 the	 more
the	mortal	which	should	become	immortal	and	the	changing	which	will	come	unchanged
so	  this	  is	  the	  work	  of	  every	  seeker	  of	  the	  truth	  instead	  of	  being	  the	  slave	  of
circumstances	his	desires	and	emotions	leaving	the	mind	slave	to	the	desires	and	being
even	 himself	 the	 slave	 of	 his	 personal	 egoism	 wake	 up	 as	 a	 personality	 control	 his
behavior	 know	 now	 the	 truth	 instead	 of	 being	 misguided	 by	 illusions	 so	 that	 you	 reach
what	i	call	the	self-consciousness	of	your	present-day	personality	and	believe	me	this	is
a	 great	 great	 gain	 you	 will	 find	 out	 that	 really	 now	 you	 live	 in	 a	 better	 way	 and	 for	 you
now	 life	 is	 precious	 it's	 getting	 a	 new	 value	 now	 something	 more	 you	 start	 respecting
that	 self	 even	 as	 the	 present-day	 personality	 while	 before	 you	 had	 no	 respect	 to	 your

personality	  so	  introspection	  is	  looking	  within	  analyzing	  your	  present-day	  self-
consciousness	and	making	corrections	you	are	not	losing	anything	you	are	gaining	much
so	 by	 trying	 to	 annihilate	 the	 ego	 is	 you	 gain	 your	 ego	 you	 assimilate	 your	 present-day
personality	 self	 to	 your	 real	 ego	 self,	 spirit	 self	 yes	 i	 will	 make	 a	 an	 exercise	 relax
