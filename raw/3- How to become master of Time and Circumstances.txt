3-	How	to	become	master	of	Time	and	Circumstances
Now	we'll	make	a	meditation.	Breathe	deeply.	Relax	completely.
Seize	down	every	thought	and	every	emotion	in	you.	Concentrate	in	your	breath	now.
Breathe	deeply	and	feel	the	air	filling	your	lungs.
Breathe	deeply.	And	ask.	Who's	asking	now?	You.
Asking	whom?	Put	the	question.	And	sooner	or	later,	sometime	you'll	get	the	reply.	Who
am	I?	If	it	comes	before	you.
Your	name	and	your	sex	and	your	present	personality.	Don't	you	know?	I	am.	Put	the
question.
You	are	only	myself.	Or	something	more.	Who	you	are	replying	now	is	a	shadow	of	the
past.
Today	I	am	living.	And	I	am	asking.	I	am	putting	the	question,	who	am	I?	I	didn't	ask	you
to	come	forward	from	the	past.
I	didn't	ask	you	to	come	forward	from	the	past.	Who	am	I?	As	life.	As	spirit	everlasting.
I	am.	What's	that	I?	What	is	the	I-ness	in	me?	As	life.	What	you	are	presenting	me	is	my
way	of	life.
Your	way	of	life.	But	I	am	not	only	you.	You	are	a	shadow.
Who	am	I?	Who	am	I?	What	is	my	I-ness?	I	am	self-conscious.	What	is	self?	Don't	try	to
get	an	answer.	Put	only	the	questions.
Don't	 try	 to	 get	 an	 answer.	 Put	 only	 the	 questions.	 The	 answers	 will	 come	 from	 your
guardian	archangel	in	you.
Now.	I	am	living	in	this	material	body.	Ich	lebe	in	diesem	materiellen	KÃ¶rper.
Now	I	am	living	consciously	in	this	material	body.	I	feel	it.	And	I	know	I	am	living	in	it.
Yet	very	often	I	don't	feel	it.	I	am	out	of	it.	Entering	in	a	state	of	nothingness.
Which	 is	 not	 real.	 Who	 is	 recomposing	 me	 as	 a	 present	 day	 personality?	 What	 is	 that
phenomenon	 of	 the	 recomposition	 of	 my	 personality?	 After	 entering	 in	 a	 dreamless
sleep.	In	the	realm	of	the	phenomenical	nothingness.
Yet	I	am	I.	What	am	I?	Now	I	live,	I	feel	and	I	think.	Now	this	moment.	How	it	happens
that	now	I	am	and	I	am	existing.

For	so	many	thousands	of	centuries	has	passed	in	time	as	the	past.	Where	had	I	been	all
that	time?	If	I	was	not,	how	do	I	am	now?	What	am	I?	As	a	living	human	being.	As	a	soul
ego	being.
As	a	soul	self.	Beyond	sex,	form.	Or	way	of	life.
I	want	to	separate	life	myself.	From	my	way	of	life.	Very	different	from	the	one	way	of	life
to	the	other	way	of	life	of	others.
I	am	life,	living	as	everybody	else.	I	will	study	the	way	of	my	life.	And	be	the	master	of	it.
The	master	of	my	destiny.
