FOREWORD 
DliJing 111ith the Whale is a three-part 
series of intermediary 
lessons 
ofDaskalos 
and the Researchers 
of Truth. 
It is recommended 
that ,·ou first be 
familiar 
with the terminology, 
introductory 
lessons 
and introductory 
practices 
of the Researchers 
of Truth. These 
prm·ide 
a solid foundation for 
experiencing 
a more comprehensive 
understanding 
of the advanced 
lessons 
presented 
in these volumes. 
Engaging 
in the teachings 
and practices 
of Daskalos 
and the 
Researchers 
of Truth, we will find other worlds; 
worlds 
of higher 
dimensions. 
Scientists 
are now calling these worlds 
the parallel 
universes. 
They exist at finer levels of vibrations, somewhat 
similar 
to 
musical 
octaves. 
Our material 
world is not the definitive 
reality. 
Earth 
and the entire physical 
universe 
is a materialized reflection 
- a  lower 
effect of a higher cause. The true reality is not in the effect; it is in the 
cause behind 
the effect. The hi
.;
!"ler worlds 
of Existence 
vibrate 
at a 
frequency 
beyond 
the perception 
of our material 
hearing, 
material 
touch or material 
sight.  Yet these worlds 
are self-luminous 
- every 
particle 
of their substance 
radiates 
light. 
These three worlds 
of Existence 
(Material, 
Psychical 
and 
Noetical) 
are stages on which we have a role to play. The role ofless 
awakened 
people is often awkwardly 
played out on the stage of 
the 
material 
world. Those who learn more and become 
skilled are better 
actors on this material 
stage. These people 
can also perform 
roles in 
sub planes of the Psychical 
Worlds. 
With sincere 
training 
they can 
become 
even better actors and preform 
important 
roles in the 
Noetical 
World or what some Spiritual 
schools 
are calling the Mental 
Planes. 
What does such a person 
who can live consciously 
in all 
three 
Worlds 
of Existence 
find? They find many glorious 
levels of 
reality. 
But ultimately, 
they find their real Self. They realize that whether 
they 
are 
working 
in the Material 
World in a material 
body, or if 
they 
work 
using 
their higher bodies 
in the Psychical 
and Noetical 
World 
they are 
always 
an 1-ness -a  Self. They are no more or less. No matter 
which 
role 
they perform 
in any of the three Worlds 
of Existence 
or how 
well they perform 
that role, they are always the same Inner 
Most 
Self. 
The ro

es they perform 
may be different 
but a person's 
inner
most

DEDICATION 
The search for truth concerning God, man and the 
nature of reality is perhaps the greatest  undertaking one 
could ever assume in their lifetime. It is a calling of many, 
but ultimately it is an underlying necessity for all. It is with 
great pleasure I dedicate this writing on one hand to my 
family,  friends and to all the seekers of truth worldwide. 
On the other hand, I sincerely dedicate this writing to the 
masters and brother/sister guides  whom work selflessly to 
keep the Spiritual path well illuminated for us all.

Chapter 1 
ALIGNMENT 
ATTUNEMENT AT
-ONE-ME
NT 
This lesson 
has a very important 
message 
for any 
seeker 
of truth. 
As a personality, 
the initial 
aim of Spiritual 
unfoldment 
is about 
aligning 
and attuning 
your 
personality 
self with you Inner 
Self - the Permanent 
Personality 
Self. 
We speak 
of our Selfhood 
in four distinct 
states 
of 
expression. 
At the top, it is the Holy Monadic 
Self - the 
eternal 
Spirit 
Being 
Self.  Then 
we have 
the Soul Self, 
which 
is really 
the Spirit-Soul 
Self - they are not separated. 
Then 
there 
is the expressive 
part of the Soul, 
the 
Permanent 
Personality 
that projects 
a Ray of itself 
into the 
worlds 
of Existence 
and presents 
a present-day 
personality. 
The thoughts, 
emotions, 
desires 
and actions 
of the 
personality 
dress 
this luminous 
Ray of Life-Light 
in varying 
degrees 
of shades 
and colors. 
This determines 
the degrees 
of happiness 
experienced 
by a person. 
The word 
"person" 
is the right 
word 
because 
it 
comes 
fron1 
the word 
"Persona". 
Persona 
is a Latin 
word 
that originally 
referred 
to a mask 
worn 
by an actor 
for a 
role in a play. 
That 
is what 
our personality 
is, a mask 
we 
ourselves 
create 
and wear 
during 
our role in this current 

lifetime. But behind the mask of this current lifetime, or 
any lifetime, is the same Inner Self. 
Initially, it does not matter if you currently find 
yourself playing the role of a heroic personality, a dutiful 
personality, an irresponsible personality or any other type 
of personality. Any one of them will do to get started, 
because the life of each personality attracts the next most 
needed lesson for their Spiritual unfoldment. Whatever 
state our personality is in right now, good or not so good, 
is the perfect place to begin. Every happy ending needs a 
starting point. Behind the mask of every personality is the 
eternal Inner Self. And it is that Self we are seeking. It is 
that  Self that is currently wearing the mask of our 
personality bearing our name. 
But, to achieve our aim, we must make the effort to 
align our present-day personality self with the Permanent 
Personality - that Inner Self that already knows everything. 
When the alignment is true and clear, then the present-day 
personality comes to know what the Inner Self knows. 
Alignment is a method that leads to Attunement and 
eventually to At-One-Ment with the Inner Self. 
We have spoken frequently about the Etheric 
Double of the material body. We have done many 

e
xercises that put us in contact with this Etheric Double. 
The exercises train us in its proper use. Now we will also 
be discussing and working with the Etheric Double of our 
Psychical and Noetical body, which are connected and 
coexist as one. In doing this work, we will be able to join 
the three bodies: material, Psychical and Noetical, so to 
have a unified  whole. This is what Joshua Immanuel the 
Christ was teaching in his parable  about the woman and the 
three measures of flour.  Christ  said: The kingdom from 
heaven is like  yeast that a woman took and mixed with 
three measures of flour until all of it was leavened." We 
spoke about this before. The woman represents our 
personality and the three measures of flour are our three 
bodies: material, Psychical and Noetical. The woman had 
to mix them in a balanced proportion with leaven (the 
Etheric Vitality) until they were one. So this is our task -
to blend, harmonize and connect our material body, with 
the body of our emotions and the body of our thoughts 
and unite them as one. The connecting link, the 
harmonizing agent is the Etheric. 
A human being in any of the worlds of Existence is 
dual in one. We have the human nature of our present-day 
personality and we have the Divine Nature of the Inner 

Self. Both of these expressions fall under the umbrella of 
our Selfhood. In our Spiritual journey, it is important to 
learn  how to distinguish these  two expressions of our 
Selfhood. We come to know  this difference with 
Observation and Introspection. We will soon realize that 
our personality self with its subtle or not so subtle  egoistic 
expressions is in a continuous clash with the Inner Self. 
We must learn to  disentangle our identity from the 
present-day personality, which in its worst moments 
ignores and revolts against the guidance coming from the 
Permanent  Personality. It's so transparent in its best 
moments that the light of the Inner Self is able to shine 
brightly in and through the personality. Now we start to 
shift our identification of our Self with the Inner Self and 
away from the present-day  personality self. From this 
point on when we say "I" we will mean the Permanent 
Personality Self. We will no longer work like ordinaty 
people do. We will work from the two points - the 
present-day personality self and the Permanent  Personality 
Self. Again these are two points within the one Selfhood. 
As a  present-day  personality it is vital to  cultivate the ability 
to feel this Inner Self and know that we are it. Maybe you 

think 
chat chis is not so easy since 
we have 
co
mplet
ely
identified 
our Self 
as a limited 
personalit
y
. 
But still, chis is our aim in Introspection: 
to align the 
present-day 
personality 
self with 
the Inner 
Self and learn 
to 
follow 
its guidance. 
This process 
happens 
slowly, 
it needs 
time 
to mature; 
it cannot 
be done 
in an instant. 
At first 
maybe 
the present-day 
personality 
wants 
to revolt, make 
demands 
and cut deals with 
the Inner 
Self to preserve 
its 
way of life. But with effort 
and time, 
the personality 
slowly 
starts 
to accept 
the instructions 
of the Inner 
Self. 
Now 
the 
alignment 
starts 
and the personality 
begins 
to reason 
and 
sees its 
life from 
a higher 
perspective. 
We have 
to undo 
the conditioning 
of our society, 
which 
teaches 
us to seek 
exte
r
nal things 
that are pleasant. 
That 
cultural 
overlay 
considers 
reality 
to be what 
we can get and what 
we can do. 
Unfortunately, 
most 
people follow 
that cultural 
imperative 
blindly. 
As the alignment 
of your 
personality 
with 
you Inner 
Self becomes 
stronger, 
the clash 
between 
the two stops. 
That 
clash 
between 
the personality 
and the 
Inner 
Self has 
caused 
much 
suffering 
to the personality 
and delays 
its own 
Sp
iri
tual unfoldment. 
Now, 
alignment 
becomes 
attunement 
and eventually 
At-One-Ment. 
Then 
instead 
of 
10 

the clash there is a harmonious coexistence and the 
personality will express  itself as one being. But to reach 
that  stage our search  begins with the present-day 
personality self in the condition it is in right now. This 
search  enables the personality to ascend, to receive 
instructions and feel one with the Inner Self. 
It is only when the personality self is convinced that 
the alignment is completely for its own benefit, that it 
willingly accepts the instructions of the Inner Self. Then 
we coexist and in attunement the personality self and Inner 
Self work as one. Before this point, most personalities 
function as a limited Existence and carry tbe encumbrance 
of its karma blindly. All the while the Inner Self remained 
pure and uncontaminated by the weaknesses and karma of 
the personality. 
At first we have the coexistence of the personality 
with the Inner Self but not yet the oneness between them. 
Then a time comes when we start to consider, "Wbo am I 
as a personality and who am I as the Inner Self?" As a 
personality, we may feel we are carrying a heavy cross of 
our karmic material Existence. We are - but  only to a small 
degree. Really it is the Inner Self that carries most of the 
weight of the cross of its lower self - the personality. In a 
II 

similar way it is  the Christ Logos that carries most of the 
weight of the cross of humanity. You can discover this 
yourself during your practice of Introspection. 
As a personality aligned with the Inner Self, we start 
our work on the three different ethers of the Etheric 
Double of the material body. At least two thirds of your 
personality self is the Sub-Consciousness and the other 
third is consciousness or alertness. This alertness or 
vigilance reaches up to the Psychical and Noetical elements. 
Alertness is an aspect of the Noetical Etheric Double. We 
can call this alertness reason and it can lead to Self­
Realization. 
It is through the Introspection and meditation 
exercises that we can unite our material, Psychical and 
Noetical natures as in the parable of the woman mixing the 
three measures of flour. We begin our work on the ethers 
of the Etheric Double but we are not working with all the 
ethers simultaneously. We start separately with the 
aesthetic, the kinetic and the imprinting ethers. Once we 
master them we automatically gain the powerful creative 
ether. 
By using them separately we might  imagine that 
means we can separate the ethers of the Etheric Double. 
12 

But each atom of the Etheric Double contains all the ethers 
so they cannot be separated in substance. We can use the 
ethers separately in order to know the difference between 
their  natures. This teaches us, for example, that it is the 
Aesthetic Ether that gives us the sense of feeling pleasure 
or pain and it is the Kinetic Ether that facilitates 
movement. The most important work we will do is done 
with the Imprinting Ether because it is required for 
Introspection. The work of Introspection is done with the 
Imprinting Ether in cooperation with the Psychical and 
Noetical  Etheric  Double. This is because, during 
Introspection, we will recall imprinted images of e,·ents and 
actions, in order to know, control and change our desires 
and feelings. Changing your desires and feelings means you 
are changing a part of your Psychical body. Likewise 
during Introspection we recall imprinted images from 
memory and examine our thoughts and intentions, which 
have now become living elementals. So we are also 
working on the Noetical imprinting ether. \X'e do not limit 
our investigation to only the Etheric Double of the material 
body, but also simultaneously work on the Psychical and 
Noetical  Etheric Doubles. 
13 

For now we will not work on the higher bodies 
directly or individually but on their Etheric Doubles. Later 
in more advanced work we will learn to work on the two 
higher bodies and their Etheric Doubles separately. The 
two higher bodies are used for Exosomatosis and for the 
expression our Self as a Being. But let's be clear; that Self 
is now the personality self and the Inner Self united. To 
be successful we must feel this oneness between the two. 
In this state our personality self is no longer separated from 
the Inner Self. If you manage an out of body experience 
before this unification, it can harm your personality. When 
the personality self-matures and assimilates with the Inner 
Self then we can have an out of body experience without 
any effort. The personality will find itself out of its material 
body living consciously, fully alert and one with the Inner 
Self without any effort. 
We have to mature and that is done through the 
daily practice of Introspection by studying an event from in 
our 
life both as a personality and as the Inner Self. As a 
person
ality self we kneel before our Inner Self and sincerely 
ask it to purify and save us. Rightly so because, to our 
present-day personality self our Inner Self, is our god; and 
it is through this Inner Self that we find we are that god. 
14 

W
hen 
Christ 
said, "You 
are gods - sons of the Almighty," 
he m
eant we are gods as the Inner Soul Self, not as a 
p
ersonality self. 

Questions 
Q.  Is my understanding correct that the Psycho­
�oetical body is the perfect Psychical and Noetical body of 
the Permanent Personality or is this Psycho-Noetical body 
the body that we develop to assimilate with our Permanent 
Personality? 
A. The perfect Psychical and Noetical body as an
archetypal form is the projection of the Permanent 
Personality and is held for us bv the Guardian Archangel. 
That is true.  But we because these two bodies are joined 
together most of the time we call them Psycho-Noetical 
body. But they can be separated by and advanced 
Researcher of Truth and used separately. But most of the 
time they are joined. For an average person they are 
undeveloped and our work is to shape them ourselves 
according to the archetype held by the Guardian Archangel. 
The Psycho-Noetical body is initially shapeless, yes but it 
takes more than one incarnation to shape this Psycho­
Noetical body as perfect as the archetype. And we have 
given meditation exercises that train us how to shape a 
perfect Psycho-Noetical body. 
16 

Remember at the core of the personality is the 
pulsating, luminous ray of our Spirit Soul Self. Our 
thought, emotion and desire type elementals dress this ray 
;f Spirit and obscure its luminosity according to the quality 
and quantity of these elementals. 
Sometimes we and other systems refer to the 
Psychical and Noetical body, which are composed of our 
emotions and thoughts as the Psycho-Noetical body. This 
is partially because they are mixed together most of the 
time. In general we prefer to separate them calling them 
the Psychical body and the Noetical body. In this way we 
may learn about them individually, work  with  them and 
master them separately. 
And we also use the term Psycho-Noetical body 
because while lh�ng in a material body the Psychical and 
Noetical bodies are interwoven in and around the material 
body. You cannot have a material body without its 
Psychical and Noetical counterpart. However, you can have 
a Psychical and Noetical body without a material body. But 
you cannot have a Psychical body without the Noetical 
counterpart woven in and around it. 
17 

Sometimes we also say Psycho-Noetical, which is a 
reference to the expressive bodies of the self-aware 
personality (emotional body and body of thoughts). Now 
just as our material body is composed of individual but 
different cells, our Psycho-Noetical body, our personality, 
is composed of our different thought-desire and desire­
thought elementals. 
For people who are not spiritually wakening and 
have not made any effort to construct a proper Psycho­
Noetical body, which is to say a personality of good 
character, their Psychical body is in an oval like mass with 
colors corresponding to their feelings. However, the 
training of the Researchers of Truth gives us information 
on how to use our Psycho-Noetical body independently 
from the material body. With practice we can create a 
perfect Psycho-Noetical body complete. 
The present-day personality's Psycho-Noetical body 
includes the Sub-Consciousness and is composed of the 
accumulations of thoughts, feelings experiences and 
impressions. This Sub-Conscious accumulation is also what 
we are calling a person's shell that a person will find 
themselves in after the death of their material body. 
18 

Because of this, the personality on the Psychical planes 
after passing over sees and hears through the filters in their 
shell. The cleaner the thoughts and emotions composing 
your shell the better you can see and understand. On the 
Psychical planes the personality does not grow in age but 
grows in terms of maturity. In time the personality learns, 
by itself and with the help of others, as it matures that it 
can use every particle of its Psycho-Noetical body to hear 
and see and its comprehension greatly increases. 

Meditation 
Your Archangelic Appearance 
Start by breathing very comfortably and ver
y 
consciously. In your mind's eye, mentally create an equal­
sided triangle on a snow-white floor. See the lines 
composing the triangle's sides radiate golden light but the 
inner part of the triangle stays white. 
See yourself clearly standing in the middle of this 
triangle. :'.'Jow mentally draw a line from the center towards 
each corner of the triangle on the floor. You have created 
three triangles within the larger one.  You are standing at 
the middle point of these three triangles. 
Your right foot is on the angle of the inner triangle 
on your right side. Your left foot is on the angle of the 
inner triangle on your left side. Your heels are touching the 
inner triangle behind you.  See yourself standing on the 
three triangles that are all inside the big triangle. 

See 
a clean 
golden 
flame 
rise up from 
the floor 
of 
the 
right  side 
of the triangle. 
As it touches 
your 
right 
foot, 
it come
s up 
through 
your 
right 
leg, approaches 
your 
solar 
plexu
s from 
the front, 
crosses 
over 
to the left side 
of your 
body, 
moY
es on under 
your 
lefr armpit, 
rises 
to the left 
shoulder 
and 
moYes 
m·er 
to the right 
shoulder 
in a straight 
line. From there it spreads out and up as three golden rays 
that look like a wing. 
Now a golden flame rises up from the floor of the 
left side of the triangle. It touches your left foot, comes up 
through your left leg, approaches your solar plexus from 
behind, crosses m·er to the right side of your body, moves 
on under your right armpit, rises to the right shoulder and 
moYes o,·er to the left shoulder in a straight line. From 
there it  spreads out and up as three golden rays that look 
like a wing. 
You see yourself as if you have wings of  fire rising 
aboYe your shoulders. The color of the light of the flames 
that come from the left and right side is clear golden­
yellow. 
Now 
a snow-white 
light 
starts 
rising 
from 
the floor 
on 
the backside 
of the triangle. 
It slowly 
touches 
the 
21 

backside 
of rnur feet, reaches your thighs, enters in your 
pe!Yis and moves up to your solar plexus. 
The white light ascends to the center of your heart 
and then slowly reaches your head center. It moves on 
beyond your head, taking on the shape of a radiant bright 
sun. 
Raise your etheric arms and place them in the radiant 
golden wings above your shoulders. Now gently move 
your golden wings of fire. Now you are dressed in your 
archangelic appearance - see it all together clearly. 
Your archangelic brothers sing in exultation, children 
of Spirit and fire.  Send your love everywhere to everyone 
and wish that the kingdom of God will reach the Earth. 
Do not dissolve what you have built up. Let it work. 
Wherever you go, whatever you do, you will radiate the 
love of God! 
Higher guidance will be the subject of our next 
lesson describing how the egoism of a personality revolts, 
interferes and blocks Diving guidance. And we will begin 
to distinguish how much of the time the Inner Self is in 
control and how much of the time it's shadow, the egoism, 
is in control of our life.

Chapter 2 
GUIDANCE 
We must 
learn 
to live more 
consciously, 
paying 
closer 
attention 
in order 
to understand 
and see things 
as 
they really 
are and not as we hope 
they will be.  This 
again 
is a power 
of the Soul 
that must 
be developed. 
We do not 
do it as a male 
or female 
person, 
because 
your 
Soul 
Self is 
not a male 
or female 
and has no name 
but, "I Am." 
Your 
Soul Self is not expressing 
a male 
or female 
sex. 
But 
this
does 
not mean 
the Soul Self is sexless, 
there 
are both. 
As a 
Soul 
you feel complete 
and balanced 
in every 
way. 
This 
state 
is a very beautiful 
state 
of balance 
- of feeling, 
knowing 
and being 
a god. 
But 
this 
state 
is not the final 
destination; 
we have 
not entered 
fully in the one ness 
of 
God. 
We still have 
to unfold 
the Soul 
Self as the Spirit­
Soul Self. 
As a human being 
incarnated 
in the Worlds 
of 
Existence, 
we have 
the feeling 
of being 
separated 
from 
our 
source 
- God. 
But God 
is omnipresent; 
equally 
present 
everywhere 
so this sense 
of separation 
is not real but a 
phenomenon. 
It is our time 
and place 
self, the personality 
that is creating 
that sense 
of separation 
and not the Soul 
Self. 
24 

None of the Archangels in any order has a Soul. 
Each one has its archangelic Self, but not a Soul. By 
attunement or in the case of the Guardian Archangel by 
At-One-Ment to the Spirit Soul of human beings, they 
kn.:iw about the nature of the Spirit Soul. The Archangels 
of the Elements are completely attuned with all our bodies; 
they are creating them, sustaining them and presenting 
these bodies for us to live in. By attunement they can and 
do come into contact with our Soul Self, and they love it. 
They do not want to come into attunement with the 
personality.  They could do it but they never do it.  The 
personality is not pleasant to them as it is contaminated 
with negative thoughts, feelings and the idea of 
separateness. To them a personality's egoism has a very 
unpleasant smell. \'v'hile we are under the sense of 
separateness, the Archangels rightly  consider the 
personality a prodigal son. Of course they totally Joye us 
but they do not want to attune to our personality. Do they 
know our names? Again they do not want to or need to; 
because the names they hear and know us by are the 
,·ibrations we make as a Soul Self. 
The Archangels have their own languages, separate 
languages, which are very different from the human 
25 

languages of English, German, Greek, and so on. The 
languages of human beings are a mixture of confusing 
sounds and meanings. But the archangelic languages are 
vibrations that make sounds and different colors of 
light. 
They understand each other's language. This is because all 
archangelic orders are in the oneness of God, and their 
language is a language of love and light so being in full 
attunement with the light and love of the Logos, they 
understand each other. 
In full Self Consciousness through attunement, a 
human being can understand their languages; Saint Paul 
mentioned that in his writings. You will not hear them 
with your ears, but with your heart. Blessed are the pure in 
heart for they shall see God and hear the Archangels. 
Being in touch with them you know what they know and 
they know what you know as a Soul Self. But they do not 
want to connect or interfere with the personality of human 
beings. 
Human beings are Archangels that have become 
humanized. This means we are gods as they are gods. It is 
a great joy for an Archangel to become humanized and 
manifest a Spirit-Soul Self. So we should honor the 
Human Idea and not enslave that part of our Soul Self to 
26 

the personality's egoism and the bodies. We should love 
the human form, and also love in our three bodies. They 
are .a gift from God. 
Reaching the level of being able to attune to the 
Archangels' vibrations, a person will know all the languages 
of the Archangels. Then latter an advanced mystic can use 
their languages as his own but first they will understand by 
intuition. What is intuition really? It means co-vibration -
attunement. So attunement gives perfect understanding 
between the Archangels and human beings. First we know 
them by intuition then latter by direct contact. So we 
should leam to allow ourselves to be guided by Archangels 
and by other guides too, through intuition. 
At first you may notice your Guardian Archangel's 
guidance as an insightful thought and if you are alert you 
may realize this insight did not originate from your own 
thinking. At this point, the person receiving this insight 
may mistakenly think the thought came from outside them. 
That is a mistake because your  Guardian  Archangel is not 
outside of you but in you. 
If we are over doing  things that are wrong the 
Guardian can give a kind of slap; it is the sting of 
consciousness, which can be very painful to your 
27 

personalin-. This is only done in love so as to wake you up 
to bad mistakes you may be making without realizing it. 
Our Guardian Archangel is very loving and when we are 
aligned we may experience inspiration and intuition coming 
from him.  One day you can hear him clearly via 
clairaudience. In time you will be given the second sight of 
clairrnyance and be able to see him, not with your material 
vision but with Psychical vision. 
First, we must sincerely practice the proper exercises 
for breathin
g
, concentration, observation, and visualization 
chat raise our personality's consciousness and leads to 
intuition. Intuition is a capability of the Soul Self.  Certain 
exercises of concentration in the area of the solar plexus 
and other centers, gives us an initial level of intuition.  It 
will give us a sense of what people around us are feeling 
and thinking. Certain concentrating exercises in the area 
of the third eye will give us another level of intuition. But 
do not just strongly concentrate in this area and try to open 
this gate with force - that will only give you a headache. 
In addition to regular sight we will develop the 
second sight of intuition as the third eye opens. Regular 
sight 
gives us  experiences and understanding in the 
mate
ri
al 
world.  The second sight gives us experiences and 
28 

understanding in material, Psychical and Noetical World. 
But be advised: Just as we can be deceived and mistaken 
from regular sight in the material world, we can also be 
mistaken and deceived by the second  sight.   This means 
we still  need to use Observation, Concentration and 
Meditation to know the truth of what we see. So after 
much practice we will  develop an alert personality, now our 
passions and undisciplined thoughts give way to our new 
abilities of intuition, telepathy and Exosomatosis. 
Divine Guidance: many people would like to receive 
Divine Guidance in their life. But we are recehwg Divine 
Guidance all the time in such simple quiet ways we often 
overlook it.  Or maybe we are so engaged and busy with 
our life that we fail notice it.  It takes alertness and 
Obser
v
ation tc be able to recognize it when it comes. The 
more  simple and peaceful you become the easier it is to 
receive Divine Guidance. 
We can distinguish several ways Divine Guidance 
comes to us.  The first is by intuition from the Guardian 
Archangel or other guides as we have just spoken about. 
Of course,  children naturally have intuition before the 
clamoring world conditions drown it out. As a child grows 
he or she tends to lose touch with intuition and they come 
29 

to rely on external voices of authority. Still it is natural for 
humans to have intuition because as we said it is a 
capability of the Soul. As a child grows they learn not to 
listen to the inner voice of intuition and so that great gift 
becomes deadened. That does not mean it is lost forever; it 
can be re awakened. 
If our intuition has become dull and muted, there is 
another mode of Divine  Guidance  presented  next. This 
guidance is  presented in the real world as an illustration. 
For example, if a person is getting caught up in gambling 
and is going astray, that person may see an example of how 
someone  destroyed their life by gambling. Maybe they read 
about it, see on TV or in a movie, but it is  brought across 
their path in this gentle way as guidance for them at a 
particular moment in their development. This kind of 
Diving Guidance can appear repeatedly. Pay attention 
when that happens because there is an important message 
being given. Also good examples may be brought across 
our path to show, guide and inspire us at a particular 
auspicious time. Often this kind of Divine Guidance goes 
unnot
iced too. 
If we are not alert enough to see Divine Guidance in 
such outer world examples, then the Divine Guidance 
30 

reaches us through a spoken word. This spoken guidance 
can come from anyone. Of course it is best when it comes 
from a loving  brother or  sister guide. Less agreeable is 
when the Divine Guidance comes to you from a person 
you do not know. Even more difficult to accept is when it 
comes  through a person you have difficulties with. 
Even if we cannot see or hear the Divine Guidance 
in these w2ys, it finds other ways. This time it can be 
understood in an outcome of some action or lack of action. 
On the positive side we may experience a kind of reward 
coming from our good actions that encourages and guides 
us on through positive reinforcement. On the negative 
side, we might experience a loss resulting from our 
mistakes. We may lose something we value by our actions 
and that too is Divine Guidance. Sometimes people must 
learn what good they had by losing it so as to learn to place 
the proper value on it.  This is like the old Sa)�ng, "You do 
not  know  what you've got until it is gone." 
The final way is often called punishment but it is not 
really punishment - yet it is a consequence. This way may 
give you a bitter lesson, but this way only comes after the 
other ways are overlooked or ignored. Even with a 
negative consequence a great reward also comes. As 
31 

Daskalos 
has said, 
"The more 
bitter 
the experie
nce 
that 
comes 
to us to wake 
us up, the greater 
the lesso
n that 
is 
gi,·en". 
By missing 
the other 
opportunities 
of 
receivin
g 
Divine 
Guidance, 
this opportunity 
to learn 
com
es as 
the 
Whip 
of Destiny. 
It is the hardest 
and 
most 
painful 
but it 
is very 
effective. 
All these 
ways 
are a loving aspect of 
Divine 
Guidance. 
How 
can the agonizing 
Whip 
of 
Desti
ny 
be considered 
loving 
guidance? 
It would 
be un-loving 
for 
God 
or call it Life, 
to leave 
one 
blinded 
and 
entangled 
by 
their 
illusions 
forever 
and 
ever. 
Sooner 
or later 
we have 
to 
wake 
up and come 
out of the illusions 
to live life more 
abundantly. 
Instead 
of being 
painfully 
guided 
by the Whip 
of 
Destiny; 
let us be proactive 
and 
make 
the effort 
in 
advanc
e 
to distinguish 
the truth 
from 
illusion. 
And 
we can do 
that 
by 
reflection. 
How 
is that 
done? 
To know 
what 
our 
material 
body 
looks 
like we use a mirror 
to see it 
by 
reflection. 
We can also 
see and 
know 
our 
persona
lity 
sel
f 
as well 
as our Soul 
Self 
by reflection, 
by way 
of an 
inne
r 
reflection 
and not an outer 
one. 
This 
way 
of 
inner 
reflection 
has been 
given 
many 
times. 
This 
way 
is
Introspection 
using 
Visualization. 
When 
we 
do
Introspection 
we are looking 
within 
to see 
and 
know 
ou
r 
32 

Psychical nature, which means the quality and quantity of 
our desires, feelings and motivations we harbor. We also 
look within to see and know our Noetical nature, which 
means the quality of our thoughts and intentions. 
We are looking in a triple-panel mirror and we see 
our material,  Psychical and Noetical natures reflected in 
them. The reflection in these  three mirrors is distoned and 
not presenting the reality well. The material, Psychical and 
.\:oetical  reflections are a misrepresentation of our Spirit 
Soul Self. The real problem is that we have mistaken our 
reflection in these mirrors to be our real  Self.  Our 
reflection in the time,  space  and  place material, Psychical, 
and Noetical mirrors is not the real Self. 
What would happen to you if you stood looking at 
your image in a physical  mirror and you shattered this 
mirror? Absolutely nothing would happen to you. The 
refection would go away without any  effect on you. It is 
the same with the death of the material body; you continue 
to exist unharmed. It is the same with the second death, 
the end of your Psychical  Existence. It is the same with the 
third  death that ends your Noetical Existence. After these 
three deaths, you are still you, your real Spirit Soul Self. So 
33 

this is the point: 
you are you even without 
your reflection 
in the mirrors 
of Existence. 
Ofte
n I  hear 
people 
express 
the wish to be close 
to 
a 
good teacher 
or an advanced 
master 
and receive 
personal 
guidance. 
Of course 
this can be a truly great benefit 
especially 
at crucial 
points 
in a seekers 
life.  But even in 
such a case a master 
can only point the way, show you the 
methods 
and explain 
to you the steps. 
Still it is you who 
must use those methods 
and make your steps to progress 
on the way the 
master 
shows 
you.  And there are limits to 
what even the greatest 
human 
master 
can reveal. 
One 
reason 
is that they are not allowed 
to reveal 
more that is 
permissible 
to a seeker 
according 
to that seekers 
current 
state of development. 
Another 
reason 
is the uppermost 
levels of consciousness 
that an authentic 
master 
has 
reached 
through 
his or her initiations 
cannot 
be 
express
ed 
in words. 
And even if they 
try, Earrh languages 
are too 
weak to convey 
the meaning 
behind 
the words. 
In 
eastern 
Spirirual 
systems 
we see that a 
main ai
m 
of Spiriru
al unfoldme
nt is to seek liberati
on 
from the 
sorr
ows 
and 
suffering of life in the Worlds 
of 
Exist
enc
e. 
While 
we 
are su
ffering 
in these worlds 
of illusio
n this 
is 
an 
un
derst
an
dable 
goal.  But it is not necessa
rily 
the 
cho
ic
e 
of 
34 

every Research of Truth in our system. Christ advised that 
the stronger should help shoulder the burdens of the 
weaker. So in this gentle recommendation some see an 
alternative to seeking their own liberation for their own 
sake. We see this also in certain lines of Buddhism in the 
examples of the Bodhisattrns, who because of their great 
compassion for others are inwardly compelled to seek 
Buddhahood for the benefit of all conscious Beings. 
So following Christ's persuasion; the goal of some 
Researchers of Truth, the brothers and sisters of mercy, is 
to unfold their Self-Consciousness and Self-Super­
Consciousness and then instead of seeking liberation from 
this world, return to the world to help their fellow human 
beings. It would be a mistake to think the brothers and 
sisters of mercy are doing this noble work out of am· sense 
of sacrifice. They are not called  brothers and sisters of 
sacrifice but brothers and sisters of mercy. So this work is 
love in action. \\\'har better definition for mercy could 
there be but unselfish love? 
Daskalos is, was and will always be a most brilliant 
example of a qualified brother of mercy. On many 
occasions he shared with us his heart-felt aim to stay here, 
here in the Worlds of Existence and be the handkerchief 
35 

that 
wiped 
the tears 
from 
the eyes 
of his suffering 
fellow 
human 
beings. 
These 
lessons 
we are giving 
in the live broadcasts 
of 
Virtual  Circle  lessons 
contain 
guidance 
that 
is higher 
than 
those 
given 
to a Researcher 
of Truth 
that 
is first 
being 
introduced 
to the teachings 
and 
making their 
initial 
approach. 
This guidance 
will 
be of far more 
benefit 
to 
those 
of you 
who 
are practicing 
and 
are advancing 
successfully 
with 
the given 
meditations 
in the Gates 
to the 
Light 
book 
and 
the other 
audio 
meditations 
At this 
point 
in your 
practical 
development 
you 
will 
know 
something 
about 
what 
the Noetic 
Super-Substance 
is, 
respect 
and 
value 
it.  It comes 
to us as light 
- luminous 
light. 
And 
this 
light 
carries 
within 
it, wisdom 
and 
higher 
states 
of perception. 
This 
light 
also 
will 
contain 
somethin
g 
of lower 
conditions 
and 
perceptions 
and 
yet in this 
Noetic 
light 
are the higher 
conditions 
of law-causes 
and 
principles 
that 
rule 
everything 
in found 
in the lower 
conditions. 
Now 
our meditations 
are empowered 
by our 
skillful 
use of 
Noetic 
light 
and 
become 
something 
creative - something 
that 
creates. 
But 
now 
we are not 
working 
hard  struggling 
as a 
personality 
to do the meditation. 
We 
are working 
in a 
36 

balanced state of Soul Self-Awareness. Now as 
personalities we are not working spiritual but being spiritual 
worked. What does this mean? It means that we are 
working from that stable point of the Inner Self­
Awareness.  The present-day personality of a man or a 
woman is never stable; its awareness is always changing, 
and shifting. In order to reach that stable point we must 
calm down the present-day personality by quieting the 
es-eryday thinking mind, silencing the emotions and 
aligning/ attuning to that never changing immovable point 
of awareness - our Beingness. Try to find and hold that 
point  within you now. Feel yourself as simply a point that 
receives  impressions. It does not push disagreeable 
impressions away nor does it try to pull more agreeable 
impressions to it.  It simply observes the impressions it is 
receiving. During your meditations, work from this point 
of balanced Self-Awareness, using the Noetical  Super­
Substance through the Noetic light and meditate as )"Our 
Inner-most Self .. Use the Noetic light to form the symbols 
we have given for the different meditations. 
Why symbols? What are sm1bols? The ancient 
Egyptians and Greek Mystery schools were using symbols 
to understand and embody certain truths. S)mbol making 
37 

was and is a way to communicate great truths in a simple 
and clearly recognizable way.  So in this sense we can   say 
symbols are real keys that open the gates of our 
understanding to the truth.  And the truth is a law-cause­
power. The Absolute Truth is that Absolute Infinite 
Selfhood we call God 
Reaching higher and higher states of relative truth 
empowers us.  But reaching these higher states of truth 
some may not want to immediately continue towards 
oneness with God in the final Theosis. Some may want to 
descend back down to help their suffering brothers and 
sisters, who are also God.  And so upon achieving higher 
states of realization, the great ones, dress in this Noetic 
light, turn, and descend to use this light in service. They 
descend strong, stable and invigorated with the keys of 
higher knowledge. And using the holy numbers and 
symbols being co-creators with their Spirit-Soul they 
express with power and authority. 
These advanced 
Researcher
s of T
ru
th are 
not 
working 
as ordinary 
people. 
They have shifted the 
cente
r 
of their sense of self from the unstable 
point in 
the 
personality 
to that of the stable center of Soul 
Self 
Awareness. 
They have 
found themselves 
and those 
of y
ou 
38 

who have the sincere intention and desire to love and serve 
your fellow human beings will too. It is a truly great 
experience to feel divinely guided in this way and play a 
pa.rt in ser
v
ing the Divine Plan. 
But even these most advanced human mystics can 
only teach and guide you to a certain point. How can those 
mystics who  have reached beyond the Noetical World 
explain in words  what is beyond the Noetical planes? If 
they tried it would be futile. 
But there are others who definitely can explain and 
guide you into the direct experience of those states. 
However when you return to your personality self with its 
material  brain you would know these states  directly but you 
could not express or explain them in words either. The 
ones who can explain and provide the Divine guidance to 
reach  there  are the Guardian Archangels and the 
Archangels of the Elements. But first you must be able to 
raise your consciousness high enough to reach them and be 
in Self-Conscious contact with them. 
The Divine  guidance they can provide and the things 
they can teach you are beyond what the greatest  masters 
can teach you. This is because being able to be in true Self­
Super-Conscious contact with them ?Ou can enter in their 
39 

aura and get their wisdom 
and guidance directly 
through 
Attunement 
at first and then through 
At-One-Ment. 
Attunement 
means being 
in tune with them, 
in harmony 
with 
them. 
At-One-Ment 
means 
becoming 
one of 
them
. It 
means 
assimilating 
your Self-Consciousness 
to their Self­
Consciousness. 
Ultimately 
your real guru, your true 
Spiritual 
master 
is not a human. 
Your 
real master 
is your Guardian 
Archangel, 
who attends 
to you Super-Consciously. 
Understand 
that you are never, 
ever alone. 
He has followed 
your every 
feeling, desire, 
thought 
word 
and deed, 
in this 
lifetime 
and in all previous 
lifetimes 
and in 
between 
all 
lifetimes. 
Every 
one of you listening 
to this lesson 
is 
attended 
by his or her Guardian 
Archangel 
all the time. 
Even 
when your 
personality 
is slumbering 
and dreaming 
as 
your material 
body 
sleeps 
he is not  sleeping 
but watching 
over you like a loving attentive 
mother. 
And like a loving 
mother 
your Guarding 
Archangel 
is protecting 
and giving 
important 
guidance. 
Notice 
that when 
he does 
so, it is 
without 
dominating 
over your free will 
or coercing 
you. 
But sometimes 
he will interfere 
with what 
Daskalos called 
the stings 
of consciousness 
if you go too far in the wrong 
direction. 
40 

Other human beings they can help you to a point, 
but  only  accept them as equals. If they present themselves 
as superior to you reject it for yours and their sake. Even if 
they know more than you rhat is all it is.  At this moment in 
time yes maybe they  know  more  than you and you can 
be.nefit from their brotherly or sisterly guidance. But soon 
you could be in their position knowing more  than other 
people and  you  will  guide  them - but  again  your guidance 
must be that as a brother or sister not as a superior teacher. 
We do not even use the word teacher and say that we are 
teaching others. This is a mistake. Christ said call no one 
your teacher because you have but one teacher and that is 
your  heavenly father; besides Christ's gentle advice was to 
loYe one another. He did not say teach one another. And 
so to be a brother or sister guide is to love other brothers 
and sisters. But that is all Researchers of Truth are to 
others at this level - a   loving brother or sister guide. Our 
real guide is pro,�ding the highest Ohme guidance as 
reason is in side  you.  That best guide is your own 
Guardian Archangel who is guiding your through reason. 
Depend more on your Guardian Archangel that any other 
external guide. It is much safer! 
41 

In past time poets, musicians and other artist of all 
kinds spoke of being inspired and guided by a muse. Muse 
is an ancient Greek word referring to a goddess of 
inspiration the source of higher knowledge of the arts. 
One time a writer came to Daskalos saying: 
"Daskale, you are a writer and I am also writing. But what 
is it when I am writing I feel  I am not alone? I have not 
told this to anyone else because they will think I am being 
foolish or insane. 
Daskalos began laughing and asked: "Why will they 
think that? Just because you feel when you are writing you 
are attended by invisible ones"? 
The writer continued in earnest, "But I am sure 
about it"! 
Daskalos pressed him further, "How are you sure 
about it?  Tell me." 
The fellow began to explain his experience and 
admitted: "When I start, I have something definite in my 
mind. I begin to shape my heroes, the scenery and 
everything. I start with it and then it changes. But the 
story gets better with the changes. Where are those changes 
coming from, what makes me change it"? 
42 

Da
skalos inquired, 
"Don't you know what 
inspiration 
is"? 
"What is inspiration"? The writer was obliged to ask. 
"Inspiration is the interference of other 
intelligences"! Daskalos declared with certainty. 
The writer quickly responded, "You mean that 
inspiration is my Guardian Angel"? 
Most of the time, yes, Daskalos continued, but other 
intelligences maybe are also following your, vibrating in 
harmony with you as a writer.  And they help you maybe". 
"What do you mean by 'maybe
"' 
the fellow probed, 
"maybe who? Do you mean maybe other writers? Where 
are they"? 
"Everywhere around us, the can also be inside us", 
Daskalos explained. ''They can project their elementals 
(thoughts and feelings). That is what you call inspiration 
and all writers, all poets, and all composers are speaking 
about being inspired. That means contact, and to be 
influenced from another world of another dimension, 
which is also here!  Simply that world vibrates in a higher 
rate of vibration than our material world.  So if one wants 
g
uidance, he can have it, either b
y 
his Guardian Archangel 
or b
y 
others engaged on the same line".

Questions 
Q. The esoteric teachings by Daskalos teach that as 
present day personalities we can come to perceive and 
know certain characteristics of the nature of Absolute 
Beingness, which has been always, Absolute Beingness' 
will pleasure to express its total wisdom, love and 
almightiness in the worlds of Existence. Could you 
explain, apart from the beaut
y 
and magnificence we see 
around us in the physical plane (e.g. nature) how the 
human in nature aspect of our self can come to know and 
experience this total wisdom and love, especially when 
most are unaware of their Divine Nature, and feel 
unworthy, or that God does not have the time (he is too 
busy) to be concerned with my life or my needs and that I 
am undeserving to have God spend time on me. 
A.  Part of this Question concerns God being too 
busy or not having  enough time to be concerned about 
our 
life. 
Firstly, God is Life. Our life is a luminous particle­
like ray of God's own Life-Light. God is intimately 
involved in each of our lives. Christ pointed this out 
saying, "Even the very hairs of your head are all 
numbered" and "Look at the birds of the air; they do not 
45 

sow 
or reap 
or 
st
o
re away 
in ba
r
ns, and yet y
our 
he
ave
nl
y 
Father 
feeds 
them. 
Are y
ou 
not m
u
ch m
or
e 
valua
ble 
th
an 
they"? 
Secondly 
God is not short on time. God is 
eternal 
and also exists in the temporary time, space and place 
worlds of Existence. Time as we think of it on Earth is 
only phenomena associated the worlds of the three 
dimensions. Time starts to lose its meaning in the fourth 
dimensional worlds and when a deep meditation reaches 
the higher Noetical World he or she stands at the 
threshold of the eternal now. 
Speaking to a prominently German, Swiss and 
Austrian audience, Daskalos often said in German "Zeit 
ist eine Illoon" - time is an illusion. Compared to the 
eternal realms of Beingness, the created worlds of 
Existence of time and space are in constant change and 
thus illusory. This is why in the east they call these, the 
worlds of illusion. The threshold of the eternal now is a 
division between two states of the one reality. One state is 
the eternal realm of Beingness and the other is the 
temporary time, space and place worlds of Existence. 
Now the feeling of being undeserving or unworthy 
is a self-created notion that is really based on guilt stored 
46 

in one's Sub-Consciousness. guilt and feeling unworthy 
are serious obstacles preventing a personality from 
experiencing their Divine Nature. \X'hat did Christ call the 
human beings? "Gods" - sons and daughters of the 
almighty.  Clearly any offspring of God is deserving of 
their father's care and attention. 
Christ was calling us a god, not the Absolute God, 
but a god, a child of the Absolute God. As we said 
before, an apple tree can only produce another apple tree; 
a lion can only beget another lion.  Thus, God can only 
beget a god.  Can we, as a personality, rightfully call our 
self a god? In nature we can but in expression no.  W'hat 
does this mean? 
This means that in our Divine Nature we already 
are a god but in our human expressions we are not 
behaving as a god or even aware we are a god.  That 
makes us gods with amnesia. 
This 
principle 
is seen in a similar 
way "ith the 
o
cean.  If 
you take a cup of water from the ocean, 
can 
you 
call 
the 
cup the ocean? 
If you analyze 
the chemical 
co
mp
osition of 
water in the cup and in the ocean 
you will 
d
efi
nitely 
confirm 
they are the same. 
They both 
co
mp
osed of 
H20 and sodium 
chloride 
so 
in nature 
they 
47 

are exactly the same. However in expression,  they are not 
the same. The cup of water is not a complete and 
powerful expression as the ocean. Just like our human in 
nature personality is not a full and complete expression of 
our Divine Nature. 
As a personality we live on Earth, but as a Spirit­
Soul the Earth and everything else lives in us.  Now a 
mystic, who knows the way, can at will, raise his 
consciousness high enough to experience this state. Also 
an advance mystic, or a higher intelligence, can lift a 
sincere seeker enough to experience this state. Sometimes 
one can have a spontaneously experience of this state of 
oneness with everything. I am speaking not only from the 
teachings but from my own experiences as well. 
Admittedly all this is very hard to understand until you 
have this experience. 
With training we can experience our Divine Nature. 
Our teachings sketch a path and map the landscape we 
travel through to reach this high state of consciousness. 
But it is our meditation practices that move us along this 
path towards a direct experience of our Divine Nature. 

Q.  What kind of help or service can we be to 
people when we are asleep at night but not yet J 00% 
conscious in the Psychical and Noetical realms? 
A. The very instant we have a sincere wish to help to 
someone or  help in some  troubled area of the world we 
create an elemental; Sub-Consciously that automatically 
goes  there. It is empowered by the strength of our loving 
desire to help. We do not have to be asleep for it to work. 
For example  there was a bad car accident on a Highway I 
became aware of.  It was so bad that it stopped all the 
traffic on the road. Many cars behind the accident there 
was an ordinary lady in her car waiting for the mangled car 
in the accident to be removed. 
It was taking a long time so clearly it was a very bad 
accident and  she became concerned for anyone who might 
have been injured in the crash. This lady, who had no 
special training in prayer, or even interested in Spirirual 
unfoldment sent a heartfelt prayer to whoever might be 
hurt in that accident. Now the severely injured body of the 
lady, lay bleeding in the car. But the lady herself, as self­
consciousness, would  latter  report that she was out of her 
material body hovering over the accident  looking down on 
it.  Many, many people who ha,·e undergone a near death 
49 

experience 
report 
this 
kind 
of phenomen
a
.  As 
she 
was 
floating 
a

a

directly  down 
to her

in her 
c
a
r.  She 
felt 
comforted 
a
nd 
w
a
s then 
drawn 
b
a
ck into 
her 
physical 
body. 
Later 
she 
recovered 
a
nd somehow, 
a

have

two 
ladies

and 
their 
story 
c

t 
a
nd 
made 
it to n
a

television. 
So here 
is 
a 
good 
ex
a
mple 
of 
how 
we can 
help, 
even 
if we 
do not 
u
nderst

nd the 
mechanism 
that allows 
u
s to help 
from 
a 
dist
a

We 
a
lso 
see 
how 
effective 
sincere, 
he
a

a
lly 
a

fact 
the 
heart  felt 
prayer 
(not

is the 
very 
best 
at achieving 
res

Also 
what

And 
a
s this

the 
q
ua
lity 
of the 
heart's 
disposition 
a
nd not 
just 
technical 
50 

skill that is needed most. Start there and work to become 
more alert, more conscious of everything you do here on 
Earth and that conscious alertness will automatically 
transfer with you when you enter the Psychical and 
Noetical World at night when your body is asleep on your 
bed. 
Q. I would like to request that the act/action of
Prayer be touched on. There are the set prayers and there 
are the  free flow prayers. Both have their points but what I 
would ask is for a deeper review of the mechanics of 
prayer. 
A. Firstly let's answer this question, \'vbat does the 
word prayer really  mean?  \'vbat does it mean to pray? Just 
going to a church, folding your hands  tc.,ge,her and 
mechanically repeating words of a memorized prayer, while 
your mind goes to other  subjects is not prayer. Just reciting 
words without concentration and entering into the meaning 
is not real prayer. A real prayer is mediation on a subject. 
But the important point is what the motivation and 
intention behind the prayer is.  A curse is a kind of prayer 
but  its intent is to harm  others. This is known as black 
magic. A prayer made only for the benefit of others is 
white magic. A selfish prayer made to satisfy our own 
51 

unnecessary 
desires is brown magic. 
If a child asks his 
fa
ther to give him a sharp knife to play with the father will 
not 
give it to him.  Likewise 
if we ask God our father for 
something 
unreasonable 
or that could 
be dangerous 
to us, 
that prayer will not be answered. 
But reasonable 
prayers 
are good and will be answered. 
Christ said this - ask and it 
will be given. 
But still we should know what we are really 
asking for. 
We should know how to pray in the right way.  The 
right way is to make a concentric 
prayer. 
Start by 
approaching yourself 
and God inwardly while 
concentrating 
and meditating, 
knowing 
what you are 
praying 
for, why you are praying 
for it and visualizing 
the 
successful 
outcome 
of the prayer. 
When you want 
something 
good ask in prayer that God grants it to you. 
There is another 
more scientific 
way in which we use 
thought to, 
concentrate 
on a certain aim or noble 
desire 
creating 
an elemental 
whose purpose 
is to bring the desire 
or 
aim to fulfillment. 
Both the religious 
and scientific 
ways 
are producing 
real results. 
By giving thanks to the   Holy 
Spirit and Archangels 
in your mind we are also making 
a 
prayer
.  This prayer is of gratitude. 
We can make a 
prayer 
of adoration 
or a prayer of thanks giving to God and the 
52 

Di
vin
e emissaries. 
So we have diff
erent 
kin
ds of 
goo
d 
p
ray
ers. 
Good 
prayers 
are always 
creating 
ange
lic 
ele
men
tals for the 
benefit 
of us, our 
loved 
ones or 
for 
h
elping anyone 
in need. 
Q. 
I read 
Dr. Stylianos 
Atteshlis 
(Daskalos) 
said that 
e
ven 
after passing 
over 
he will still be with us and 
continu
e 
gui
ding the 
Researchers 
of Truth 
circles. 
How is that 
pos
sible? 
A.  Of course the Spirit-Soul of everyone is united in 
the Common Selfhood forever. So the Soul Daskalos is 
always "with us".  Eventually we all will consciously enter 
the Common Selfhood, the Logic Selfhood and we will 
find that each Soul partakes in this Common Selfhood. I 
know that may be hard to comprehend until you have the 
experience of it,  but it is true. 
When 
I was very young 
I had my first direct 
experience of this.  Many  others have had similar 
exp
erienc
es.  In Nashville 
Indiana 
one Saturda
y morning 
I 
w
as 
eating 
breakfast 
in a crowded 
cafe and 
began 
to have a 
stro
ng 
experien
ce.  The place was bustlin
g with ac
tivit
y 
and 
I 
beg
an to see with 
my eyes wide open 
the 
ene
rgy 
fields 
of 
t
he 
w
aiters and 
the customers. 
I could 
see 
the 
ethe
ric 
v
it
ali
ty 
bei
ng 
passed 
between the people 
as 
they 
talked 
and
53 

interacted 
with 
each 
other. 
The 
experience 
intensified 
to 
the point 
where 
I could 
see that 
each 
person 
was 
like a 
finger 
on a single 
hand. 
The 
people 
appeared 
as separate 
fingers 
but all belonged 
to the very 
same hand. 
This 
experience 
revealed 
the Common 
Selfhood. 
It is like this 
in life we all have 
our attention 
on ourselves 
and 
the 
individuals 
around 
us.  Like 
the individual 
fingers 
on the 
hand, 
we feel separated 
from 
all the other 
the other 
people 
around 
us.  But when 
we trace 
each 
finger 
back 
to its 
source, 
we enter 
into 
the palm 
of the hand 
and 
find 
the 
common 
point 
- That 
is the Common Selfhood of 
humankind. 
Anyone 
can attune 
to Daskalos, 
a saint 
or any master 
and 
get real 
help 
after 
they 
have 
passed 
over. 
One 
time 
Daskalos 
told 
how 
someone 
in Australia 
had 
read 
a book 
about 
him, 
attuned 
to him 
and 
painted 
a small 
picture 
of 
him. 
He showed 
me the picture 
which 
at the 
time 
he hung 
on the wall 
of his sitting 
room. 
So in this 
case 
a person 
who 
never 
met 
Daskalos 
could 
attune 
and 
align 
to him 
just 
by reading 
about 
him 
and 
make 
a connection. 
Now, 
what 
happens 
after 
Daskalos 
passes 
over 
and 
in a century 
someone 
reads 
about 
him 
and 
tries 
to attune 
to him? 
In 
addition 
to the eternal 
Spirit 
Soul 
of Daskalos 
that 
is 
54 

c
o
n
n
e
cte
d to 
everyone 
else in the 
co
m
mo
n 
Self
hoo
d; 
there 
w
ill 
a
lso b
e 
the 
elem
ental 
of the Dask
alos 
from 
this 
lifetim
e 
for
ev
er 
reco
rded 
in the Cosmic 
Cons
cio
usne
ss. 
So pr
ayi
ng 
a
n
d 
at
tun
ing 
to the 
Spirit 
Soul 
we now 
call 
Daska
los in 
this 
in
c
arn
ation, 
people will continue to 
receive 
help. 
And 
this 
was Daskalos' 
observation 
about 
Martin 
Lu
ther'
s 
Protestan
t movement. 
Martin 
Luther 
took 
all of 
the saints and even mother Mary out of the Bible. The 
peop
le at that time 
were 
praying 
to the saints 
as they 
still do 
in the orthodox religions. The  people were  being benefited 
by this practice. So Daskalos thought Luther had done a 
dis-service by banishing these noble elementals of the saints 
for which the people were feeling the need of having them 
and 
praying 
to them. 
So what 
are the saints
? The real saints 
w
ere human 
beings 
who 
succeeded 
by prayer 
and their 
way 
of 
life to raise 
their 
self-consciousness 
to the highest 
levels 
of 
the 
Self-Su
per-consciousness. 
Therefore
, 
they 
can be 
c
ont
acte
d even 
now. 
1bis 
is because 
whateve
r 
exis
t
ed 
still 
e
xis
ts 
in the 
Cosmic 
Consciousness
.  This 
can be 
kno
wn 
by 
any
one 
reach
ing the higher 
levels 
of 
Self-
Supe
r­
co
n
scio
usness.  So Daskalos as a 
hum
an 
bein
g 
will 
be 
s 
.. 
s 
u
l 
a
va il
abl
e to us 
and will help 
when 
in
voke
d. 
Any 
p
m
t 
O 
is 
alw
ay
s one 
with us as a Spirit 
Soul in 
the 
com
m
on 
55 

Selfl1ood but we  have to meditate deeply arld raise our 
consciousness to the highest levels to really understand 
what that means.

T

and 
Relax. 
Relax 
as

You 
are

you 
feel it. 
It 
is 
in 
and 
around 
your material 
body. 
It is 
not 
the 
m
ate
rial 
body that gives 
you this feeling. 
The 
feelings 
you 
se
nse 
are the 
vibrations 
of your Etheric 
Double
, in 
which 
your material 
body is living. 
Breathe 
deeply 
and feel you are in your material 
body! You can move your attention anywhere in your 
material body. Concentrate in your solar plexus! Feel being 
in your solar plexus. 
Now move to your chest! Feel being in your entire 
chest cavity. The organs in your body are not blocking 
your mov
ement 
from one part of your body to another. 
Now 
move to your head!  Feel being in the entire 
hea
d without 
feeling 
the organ of the brain. 
You are 
si
mp
ly 
moving in 
the Etheric 
Double 
of your 
material 
bo

With 
practice 
you will be able to 
control 
your 
Ethe
ric Double 
and use it. 
Yo
u can 
see any organ in your 
material 
body 
by 
Vi

you 
can 
emp

a

ot
her 
power 
of 
your Soul and that 
is 
mag
nific
atio
n. 
In 
57 

your Visualization 
you can zoom 
in close 
and magnif
y 
your 
visualized 
images seeing  them 
in the minutest 
detail. 
This 
is a skill needed 
by those 
who do healing 
work. 
Being 
in the Etheric 
Double 
of your 
material 
body 
you can move 
anywhere. 
Now 
move 
your 
attention 
to the 
eyes. 
Move 
your 
attention 
to the tip of the nose. 
Now 
move your 
attention 
down over 
the lips and to the tip of 
your tongue 
and then down 
to your 
throat. 
Continue 
this movement 
down 
over both 
shoulders 
simultaneously 
... then down 
the upper 
arms ... and then 
down 
the lower 
arms. 
Move 
your attention 
all the way to 
the tips of your 
fingers 
and feel the etheric vitality 
there. 
Developing 
this skill of moving 
you gain 
self­
consciousness 
in your Etheric 
Double. 
Now 
you can 
self-consciously 
move 
to any part of your body 
and even 
learn 
to concentrate 
in a single 
blood 
cell. 
From 
there 
you 
can learn 
to expand 
your self-consciousness 
out of the 
body 
to any place 
you 
want 
to be. 
Now 
feel 
you 
are fully in your material 
body 
- be 
the 
master 
of your Etheric Double. 
And now ask yourself: 
"Who 
am  I,  What  am  I?"

In the next lesson we will describe the magnificent 
worlds of the seven heavens, which are microcosmically 
within us - in our Divine Nature. And mesocosmically 
these heavens exist as the various Worlds of Existence. 

Chapter 3 
THE HEAVENS WITHl� 
As we have stated often: what is, was, and will alwa
ys 
be is the  Absolute Infinite Reality, the  Absolute and 
Infinite Selfhood, we call God. In all past times, 
humankind has by necessity but also in ignorance created 
many, many false gods. Really, a better word than God is 
the Absolute Be-Ness. Not that any human being can 
really understand what this Absolute Be-ness. But at least 
by logical deduction we can conclude that Its nature must 
be an absolute state Self-Sufficiency. Absolute Be-Ness is 
Llfe itself and as such it is in need of nothing. Nothing can 
be added to it or taken away from it - this is Self 
Sufficiency. The Absolute Be-Ness, God, is Spirit, it is the 
Spirit Selfhood and this means Self-Awareness. Absolute 
Be-Ness is total Self Awareness. 
The first traceable appearance of the Be-Ness is the 
Absolute Beingness, which means the Logos and the Holy 
Spirit. In this Absolute Infinite Selfhood - after the 
manife
station of the Creation - we see Its Total Wisdom 
and 
the Almightiness. There is nothing beyond its control. 
We detect in this Absolute Beingness a plurality, a 
multiplicity of Spirit Beings some of which are destined to

is its Will

Life as 
a

th

upon billions 
of differen
t 
phenom
ena of life 
we 
see all around 
us. 
We 
can know this 
by studying 
all the different 
forms 
of life 
in the material 
world and then we 
will come 
to 
unde
rstand 
something 
about the Circles 
of Possibilities 
for 
each of these  forms 
of life.  We will see in each form the 
expression 
of the Total Wisdom 
and Total Power of the 
Absolute. There are an incalculable number of different 
life forms in the material world. The material world is our 
planet, our solar system, our lvlilky Way Galaxy and all the 
pla
nets, 
solar systems 
and galaxies 
in the three 
dimension
al 
u

Just think about all 
the countless 
forms 
of life in

and yet 
this entire material

is but 
one

the manifestation 
of an infinite number of life forms.  In 
this regard we can say that God exists 
and IS. God IS as 
the Absolute Be-Ness 
and the Absolute 
Beingness. 
God is 
and 
exists as the Christ Logos that had been humanize 
as 
Joshua Immanuel 
the Christ. 
Now a question, 
"Did Christ not exist before the 
humanization 
of Joshua Immanuel?" 
When Joshua was 
asked, "who are you?"  He replied, "Before the Earth and 
mountains 
were formed I Am."  He w1s a young man ill 
his thirties when he stated this, 
yet also feeling himself as 
the Logos he could rightly 
say, "Before the Earth and 
mountains 
were formed I Arn."  He said, "I Am."  Not I 
was.  This means he was speaking 
as the Logos in the 
Eternal Now.  At all times in the past and in the future 
there will always be this Eternal Now, which is the 
manifestation 
of the Absolute 
Selfhood. 
We have spoken about the seven heavens in 
previous 
lessons, saying that the first heaven is the entire 
material universe. 
It is l\'1ind-matter, 
Ivlind made solid. 
We said that interpenetrating 
and surrounding 
each particle 
of material substance 
is its ethereal counterpart, 
which 
together makes up the ethereal universe or the second 
heaven.

This 
ethereal 
world 
also serves 
as a link 
between 
the 
fir

ven and  the 
third heaven. 
The  third 
heaven is 
]\fin
d-
emotion, 
which 
is known 
as the Psychical 
planes. 
The 
word 
Psychical 
is a misnomer 
because 
it comes 
from 
the 
world 
psyche, 
which 
means 
Soul. 
Your Psychical 
self is 
not your Soul Self.  This third heaven is in the Earth and 
extends thousands of miles around the Earth, but does not 
come in contact with the Psychical counterpart of any 
other heavenly body. 
The 
ancient 
Egyptians 
called 
this third hea,·en, 
"The 
\'{'od
d B
eyond." 
The ancient 
Greeks 
called it the 
U
nderw

it was lower 
in 
,�bratio
n that 
Ea
rth, 
but 
because it lies just under 
the material

Noetical counterpart. Our Milky Way Galaxy with all its 
billions and billions of suns, planets and moons float within 
the substance of this Noetical universe, which is the fifth 
heaven of the five dimensions. It is everywhere in the 
sense of space and place. The ethereal counterpart of the 
N oetical universe is the sixth heaven, which is also 
everywhere as is the Noetic State. 
Now we enter into the eternal now, to the realms of 
Beingness - completely outside of any sense of time and 
beyond any concept of space. This is the Noetic State, the 
seventh heaven, which is also called the Spiritual world. 
This is a world of archetypal Ideas with laws, causes and 
principles that shape and govern all the Worlds of 
Existence and everything in them.  Beyond which there are 
more worlds. But in Beingness who could describe higher 
radiant realms of Mind with words? You will not even find 
descriptions of the seven heavens in the Spiritual books 
available today. Christ was the only one who taught much 
about the seven heavens. Unfortunately hundreds of years 
later when Rome made Christianity the official religion, His 
teachings on the seven heavens was not included into the 
Official Bible they created, yet the Church still makes 
reference to the seven heavens. Islam,Judaism, and 
64 

Hinduism all mention something about these seven 
heavens, without revealing much about them or what lies 
beyond them. 
T
he 
disciple 
Peter asked Christ, what 
was beyo
nd 
th
e 
sev
enth 
heaven. 
Christ replied, 
"Do you 
unders
tand 
th
e m
un
dane 
things 
and now you want to 
know the 
about 
the 
D
i,·ine things? 
Sometime 
you will 
know." 
Christ was 
not 
rebukin
g Peter for his question. 
It is just not 
possible 
for someone li\·ing on Earth using his or her limited 
material brain to know about the boundless nature of 
Absolute Beingness. 
\X'hen asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of 
God would come, Christ replied, "The coming of the 
kingdom of God is not something that can be obserYed, 
nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' for indeed, 
the kingdom of God is within mu."  Of course the 
Pharisees could not understand what He meant bY that, 
many are still puzzled by that declaration toda,·. 
How is God's Kingdom of the Hea\·ens within you' 
When God created human beings it is written, "God said," 
of course the word "said" means he expressed His Will. 
He said let us create man in our image and according to our 
likeness. The word, "our," is a reference to God and the 
65 

Hoh· Archangels He was addressing. According to our 
likeness means that humans are gods as they are.  To our 
image means to the image of all the heavenly worlds - the 
se,·en hea,·ens. When Joshua said the God's  kingdoms of 
the heavens are within you he was saying they are in your 
own Divine Nature, which is at the core of our Existence. 
This means we have a material body, which 
corresponds to the first heaven and the material body has 
an Etheric Double, which is of the second heaven. We also 
have an emotional body, which is of the third heaven and 
this body has its Etheric Double, which is of the fourth 
heaven. We have the body of our thoughts. This is our 
Noetical body, which is of the fifth heaven. It too has an 
etheric counterpart, which is of the sixth heaven. The 
seventh heaven is our Spirit Body but it is not really a body 
it is the human form from which all the lower bodies get 
their definition. The human intelligence cannot reach 
beyond the seventh heaven. As a personality we may feel 
we are in all these bodies, all these heavens. Yet, as a Spirit 
Soul, all these bodies, all the heavens are in us. 
The Archangels create, gm·ern and express 
themselves in all these heavens. Being at one with God, 
they are just like God. Each archangelic order has its own

When Daskalos would asked the Archangels of the 
various orders, "�b.o are you?" They start to ,-ibrate, to 
emanate the specific vibration of their order. A mystic will 
hear their reply, not with their material ear, but through 
Clairaudience they will hear the name of the Archangel's 
order. The mystic will hear the name, "Ma Ha El" or "Ra 
Fa El", or "Kha Vir El".  Their names are the sounds made 
by their vibrations. 
However when Daskalos would ask them: "\'(bo is 
Go
d?" 
They 
each would 
reply, 
"I am God." 
They 
say this 
in 
tru
th 
because they 
have never 
left the 
onenes
s 
with God. 
They 
are 
alway
s in At-One-Ment 
with Absolu
te 
Being
ness. 
As 
Spi
rit S
ouls we are 
always 
in the 
oneness 
oi 
God too. 
O
nly 
as a 
pers
onality are we feeling 
the 
sense 
of b
eing 
s
ep
ar
ate
d 
from 
God. 
The sense of 
separ
aten
ess 
is•

For 
if 
we 
wer

we could

But 
no
net
hel
ess, 
we 
67 

undergo 
this 
sense 
of 
separateness 
and 
sometimes 
feel 
we 
are 
alone. 
It 
is  easy 
for 
people 
to 
feel 
separate 
and 
always 
find 
something 
to 
complain 
about. 
That 
is  because 
they 
really 
do 
not 
know 
who 
they 
are 
or 
what 
they 
are. 
People 
are 
complaining 
about 
their 
life 
circumstances 
and 
they 
complain 
about 
the 
behavior 
of 
people 
around 
them. 
They 
complain 
about 
others 
and 
even 
their 
own 
loved 
ones 
because 
they 
have 
not 
understood 
themselves, 
the 
others 
or 
the 
World 
of 
Separateness 
in 
which 
they 
dwell. 
In 
this 
world 
of 
separateness 
what 
you 
see 
and 
conceive 
around 
you 
is not 
what 
really 
is, 
the 
true 
reality 
is not 
as 
it appears 
to 
be. 
Christ 
was 
saying 
the 
kingdom 
of 
the 
heavens 
is 
within 
us, 
within 
our 
Divine 
Nature 
and 
that 
we 
should 
enter 
and 
know 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
the 
Heavens. 
This 
is a call 
for 
us 
to 
come 
out 
of 
the 
illusion 
of 
separateness 
and 
enter 
into 
the 
oneness 
again. 
It 
is by 
using 
Introspection 
to 
dis­
entangling 
ourselves 
from 
our 
own 
illusions 
that 
we 
can 
come 
out 
of 
the 
sense 
of 
separateness. 
Egoism 
in 
the 
personality 
is the 
entire 
set 
of 
elementals, 
which 
creates 
this 
sense 
of 
separateness. 
This 
means 
we 
have 
to 
unseat  our 
own 
egoism, 
because 
egoism  cannot  enter 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
68 

t
h
e 
H
ea
vens.  E
goism 
does not want 
us to 
enter the 
Ki
n
g
do
m 
of the H
eavens either
.  In fact 
it is the 
person
a
l 
e
g
ois
m 
that 
thwarts someone 
from 
even 
think
ing they 
are 
th
e i
nc
orru
ptible Soul Self. Pay attent
ion to that 
point. 
So 
your 
first work is to get rid of your 
personal 
e
goi
sm. 
Once that 
is accomplished 
you will be 
able to 
p
lain
ly 
perceive your Soul Self and the Soul Self 
of 
eve
ryone.  But, 
while under the sense of 
separatenes
s, it is 
not 
so easy 
to see  this 
truth.  We say we know certain 
acquaintances in our life.  What do we know of them?  We 
know  their name, appearance, the way they think or feel 
about certain things and the way they behave. If the 
material body of that person dies, we feel we have lost that 
person. It is not really true but that sense of loss is   a 
co
mmon 
feeling. 
Consider 
what a human being really 
is. 
Other 
hu
man 
beings are a god 
in a form just like 
you.  So 
when 
t
he 
mat
erial body of an incarnated 
god 
dies, 
nothing 
h
app
ens to 
that god.  We are not 
losing 
them and 
wh
e
n 
we 
m
an
age 
to 
raise 
our consciousness 
to high
er l
e
vels 
we 
will 
u
n
d

and 
there 
is no real death. 
D

death is just leaving the material body and not coming back 
into the body again, which may have been sick or ver
y 
old. 
So at some point we will reach the end of the Circle of 
Possibility for our material body, we no longer need that 
material body and we pass on to another level of Existence 
to live in a more refined body. 
Because we no longer see the form of a departed 
loved one we feel we lost them. But does the departed feel 
they have lost their loved ones that are still living in a 
material body? No. It is only the living that feels this and 
this is because the living cannot consciously communicate 
with the departed who have passed over to the other side. 
But if there is real love between the departed and us we 
remain unified. It is love that unites people and 
indifference and disliking separates people. This is true on 
Earth and it is true on the other side.  Where is this other 
side that the departed pass over to? They pass over to the 
third heaven, which is the Psychical Worlds of Existence. 
The difference is in the rate of vibration of that world 
compared to the rate of vibration of the material world. 
The Earth has its Psychical counterpart, a Noetical 
counterpart and a Noetic counterpart. Many have the 
mistaken idea that with the death of their material body

This is 
because 
you will come 
to

as you really are. 
We 
have 
just described 
something 
of the 
Kingdom 
of the Heavens microcosmically and mesocosmically. To 
help his listeners better understand the Kingdom of the 
Heavens, Christ was  teaching it in parables. In one parable 
he said, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, 
which a man took and sowed in his field, which indeed is 
the least of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater 
than 
the 
herbs 
and becomes 
a tree, so that the 
birds of the 
air 
come  and  nest 
in its branch
es". 
In 
this 
simple way he was also 
descri
bing 
the la
w 
g
ov
ern
ing the 
Circle 
of Possibilitie
s. 
He was 
sa
ying 
the 
Ki
ng

of 
the 
Heaven
s is even in a little 
seed. 
But 
this 
d
o
e
s 
n
ot m
ean 
that the Circle 
of Possi
bili
ties 
is th
e 
Kin
g
do
m 
of 
the 
H
eavens. 
It means 
that 
the 
expre
ssio
n of 
t
h
e 
Ki
ng
do
m 
of 
the 
Heavens 
is even 
in th
e 
Circl
e 
of 
Pos
sib
ilities 
for a tiny s
eed. 
71 

In another 
parable 
Christ 
said, 
"The 
Kingdom 
of 
HeaYen 
is like leaven, which 
a woman 
took 
and 
mixed 
in 
three 
measures 
of flour 
till it was 
all leavened." 
This 
parable 
has remained 
a mystery 
to biblical 
scholars. 
Often 
when 
Daskalos 
would 
give 
this parable 
he would 
then 
immediately 
ask his audience, 
"Was 
Christ 
just 
teaching 
the 
bakers 
how 
to make 
bread?" 
Who 
is the woman 
mixing 
and what 
could 
this 
parable 
mean? 
The 
woman 
is our personaliry. 
The 
three 
measures 
of flour 
are our material 
body, 
our Psychical 
body 
and 
our Noetical 
body. 
The 
leaven 
or yeast 
is the Mind and 
the woman 
mixes 
it with 
the three 
measures 
of flour 
until 
it 
becomes 
a balance 
whole. 
So it is the personaliry 
that 
does 
this 
work. 
What 
is the personaliry? 
It is the woman, 
the 
personaliry 
who 
needs 
to mix 
all three 
measure 
of flour 
with 
the Mind 
in order 
to become 
full and 
whole. 
This 
parable 
is telling 
us that 
everyone, 
as a personaliry, 
has to 
make 
the effort 
to mix 
the Mind-matter 
with 
Mind­
emotions 
and 
Mind 
as thought 
to become 
a balanced 
whole 
and 
healthy 
self. 
Now, 
we come 
to the work 
required 
to achieve 
this 
and 
we start 
with 
the material 
body. 
It is not the material 
flesh 
that 
gives 
life; it is the Spirit. 
Stones 
do not mean

and

then you have

T
h
is 
is 
the 
way it 
is with the material 
body, and 
Chr
ist w
as 
gi
vin
g 
the 
prop
er 
meaning 
to  the   material 
body 
when he 
calle
d it  a temple 
of  God. 
We find our personality self is living in this material 
body but we know so little about it.  Karma permitting, our 
body with the various organs are kept in good order by the 
Archangels. They are kept in good order unless we live in a 
disharmonious way that interferes with their work. We 
should at least study the basic organs and functions of the 
material body.  Medical science has presented these things 
very well and we study anatomy and learn about it.  So a 
seeker should study the material body just to understand 
the great wisdom and power of the Archangels whose work 
it is.  With that understanding we should tr
y 
to cooperate 
with their creativeness in keeping our material body in 
g
ood 
health. 
The w
ork 
of the Archangels 
in our 
materia
l body 
is 
do
ne 
thro
ugh the Etheric 
Double.

Th
e 
73 

etheric 
vitality 
is transferred 
from the Etheric 
Double 
into 
the material 
body throughout 
the day and night. 
So every 
da
y God is giving us more than we 
need of the daily bread 
of etheric 
vitality. 
More than we need? 
Yes, more than we 
need unless 
we are wasting 
it physically, 
emotionally 
or 
mentally. 
So it is our responsibility 
that we do not waste 
this Mind vitality 
and use it reasonably. 
By way of example, 
we have said many times, we are 
getting 
100 units of this vitality 
every day.  40 units are 
needed 
by the Holy Archangels 
to build and maintain 
our 
bodies. 
Another 
40 units are needed 
by us to go about our 
daily life moving, 
working, 
thinking, 
and feeling. 
Then we 
are free to use the extra 20 units anyway 
we choose. 
Literally 
everything 
we think, feel or do is burning 
etheric 
vitality. 
We can replenish 
this vitality 
by resting 
and 
sleeping. 
We also get this etheric 
vitality 
in the air we 
breathe, 
the food we eat and the water we drink. 
When we 
do any of these consciously we 
can get even more vitality. 
Now the Holy Archangels 
separate 
this vitality 
and work 
with it materializing 
it into living matter. 
So we start the 
day with a 100 units of vitality, 
which is stored 
in one 
chamber 
of our Sub-Consciousness 
in the Etheric 
Double.

is like

We 
have pure uncontaminated 
water but 
if we mix 
it 
with dirt we 
contaminate 
it and make  mud.  So our 
work 
is to learn how to keep our allotted vitality pure and crystal 
clear.  So what is it exactly that contaminates the perfectly 
pure 100 units of this God given vitality?  It is our own 
negative feelings and thoughts so we are the only ones 
responsible for any contamination.

learn not to contaminate this pure vitality with uncontr
ol
led 
desires, emotions, vices or hatreds. 
The result of this effort is obvious. Using the 
etberic vitality properly, we maintain a strong and healthy 
material body. Now we make the material body a clean and 
suitable conduit for the expression of our Soul Self. That is 
one measure of flour. If we control our unnecessary 
desires and calm our emotions we are cleaning our Sub­
Consciousness and we gain self-consciousness in the 
Psychical Worlds. Because this work automatically opens 
the gates to the Psychical Worlds giving us self­
consciousness there. This is the second measure of flour. 
The very effort to control unnecessary desires and calm 
emotions, we are working Noetically using the Mind. This 
means we are simultaneously developing self-consciousness 
in the Noetical World. This is the third measure of flour. 
So 
the Psychical and the Noetical go together because we 
are 
using thought to control the emotions and desires. 
We 
Jive in our Psycho-Noetical body as one body. 
Now we have to study and exercise our Divine 
Nature of observation not only in the material world but 
also in all the heavens. In doing so we discover that no 
illusion can exist unless there is a reality behind it.  In the

We can know about these various 
heavens 
by study. 
First, we study the values 
of the first heaven, 
which 
is the material 
world. 
Then, 
we study the emotions, 
feelings, 
weaknesses, 
and the desires we 
value. 
This is 
another 
heaven, 
the Psychical 
Worlds. 
Here we study all 
these things 
with the aim of breaking 
our identification 
of 
our Self with 
our feelings and 
desires. 
Then, we come to

Consciousness. 
This 
is done 
by the attunement 
of our 
personali
ty self 
with 
the Spirit 
Soul 
Self. 
In that 
state 
of 
attunement 
you 
will not 
lose 
your 
identity 
as the personality 
self 
or even 
its name. 
Quite 
the opposite 
happens. 
l n  this 
state 
you 
will 
reme1nber 
the name 
of yom· 
current 
personality 
as well 
as all the names 
and 
behaviors 
of all the 
personalities 
from 
all past 
lifetimes 
- that 
is why 
this 
state 
is called 
Self 
Super 
Consciousness. 
As we progress 
in this 
effort 
we find 
that 
we have 
new 
powers 
available 
to us, such 
as attunement. 
We can 
concentrate 
on something, 
attune 
to it and 
know 
everything 
concerning 
this 
object 
in a very 
short 
period 
of 
time. 
In addition 
to the knowledge 
gained 
in attunement 
we discover 
something 
else. 
We now 
find 
out we can 
control 
the sense 
of time. 
Using 
conventional 
study 
to 
know 
something 
about 
anything 
it takes 
time. 
But 
using 
our 
latent 
power 
of attunement 
to something, 
we can know 
in a flash 
what 
might 
have 
taken 
many 
hours 
of 
conventional 
study 
to know. 
This 
is showing 
we have 
gain
ed a degree 
of mastery 
over 
time. 
Using 
the more 
advance
d but still latent 
power 
of At-One-Ment, 
we can 
enter 
into 
the oneness 
with 
the object 
of our study 
and 
78 

tr
ans
cend time completely. 
Throu
gh 
At-O
nc-M
cnr 
\\'C 
e
nter the Eternal 
Now. 
In 
a state 
of 
At-One-Ment, 
time is not 
something we 
u
ndergo 
or pass through. 
Time is something 
that is ours. 
N
ow 
we can enter and see anything 
in the 
Cosmic 
Cons
ciousness 
that interests 
us.  We make time for 
ourse
lves, meaning 
we can see something 
at any point 
in 
the 
past according 
to our interest. 
We can have time in any 
way 
we want.  We can read events from the distant past 
that took many years to unfold. But we can see these 
events 
take place slowly or as quickly as we wish.  We can repeat 
any event at any point in time.  Now we have become the 
masters 
of time. 
When we unfold past events in the Cosmic MemO!j' 
it 
is not 
like we are watching 
a movie on a two-dime
nsional 
scr
een. 
We actually 
live in these recorded 
events 
as if we 
w
ere part 
of a complex 
living hologram. 
We can 
move 
a
bou
t in the 
scenes as if we were in 
the three 
dime
nsional 
w
o

We 
will only be 
able to enter these 
events 
and 
move 
a
b

ability.  If we can 
enter 
the

we

now in the present, 
we might 
laugh 
at our lack of awareness 
in the past. 
So by reading 
the Cosmic 
Consciousness 
we 
are reliving 
the past events. 
Now 
in addition 
to becoming 
masters 
of time we have 
become 
masters 
of circumstances 
in the state of Self Super 
Consciousness. 
When 
Christ 
said, 
"There 
is nothing 
hidden 
that will not be revealed," 
he was 
referring to 
when 
we reach 
this state of Self Super 
Consciousness 
and can read all the past recordings. 
�'hat 
happens 
when 
we see disturbing 
things 
we did 
in past incarnations 
that were 
very wrong? 
To reach 
a state 
of being 
able to read the Cosmic 
Records, 
means 
we have 
become 
free of past vices 
that were 
at the root of past 
wrongs. 
So it is not painful 
to look on these 
wrongs. 
This 
is the reason 
why we do not remember 
our past lives. 
Some 
of our past lives contain 
very,  very disturbing 
events. 
We will not be able to remember 
these 
lives until we 
reach 
the level where 
they will not cause 
us pain or slow our 
progress. 
So this forgetting 
of past lives is really 
the mercy 
of 
God and it is of great 
value 
to the personality, 
freeing 
it 
from 
the pass 
so it can make 
progress 
in its current 
life.  So 
when 
we reach 
this level of Self Super 
Consciousness 
and 
see mistakes, 
wrongs 
and crimes 
from 
past times 
it canno
t 
give us remorse 
or pain.

O
f co
urse, 
many 
people 
want to 
know 
about 
their 
p
as
t 
inc
arn
ations. 
Some people 
are 
tempted to 
create with 
th
eir 
i
magi
nation 
entire past life sce
narios 
and 
believ
e they 
k
no
w 
their past lives. 
Daskalos 
warned 
us abou
t 
en
tert
aining such 
illusions 
and by doing 
so we are 
making 
an 
obs
tacle to actually 
reaching 
the 
state where 
we 
can 
a
ccess 
past life memories. 
To know for sure about 
a past 
life
, we 
must be able to trace the memories 
from the 
beginning to the end of that life. 
In reaching the state of Self Super Consciousness a 
mystic will understand how he or she vibrates or how he or 
she is making their bodies vibrate. Now it is clear that you 
are not your bodies. It is you that is making your bodies 
vibrate. You are using all three bodies but you are not the 
three bodies. So what are you then?  You are rhe Spirit 
Sou
l Self -
now 
that becomes 
the reality for 
you and 
not 
y
our 
person
ality 
self.  The personality 
lives in 
worlds of 
illu
sions; the 
material world, the Psychical 
\'\"orlds and 
the 
lo
wer 
Noetical 
World are worlds 
of illusio
n. 
After

the research

means what is real in the ultimate sense is not any of the 
worlds of Existence. 
Leaving the material body in an OBE or in the 
change called death you are still you. It does not matter if 
you are in a material body, a Psychical body or a Noetical 
body 
you are still you. The personality at any level always 
has the real Self at the core. But, to come to this 
understanding, your personality self has to rnme out of its 
illusions. Your biggest illusion is to think you are only a 
personality and its material body. The heart of your 
personality, the life of your personality is your real Self. 
Your material body cannot live without a material heart. 
Likewise your personality cannot live without the real Self, 
the Soul Self in it.  So our work is to find that real Self in 
our personality self. 
For a practicing Researcher of Truth the most 
interesting thing is not past life memories. What is 
interesting us are the lessons and strengths that come from 
all these past lives and manifest as our current talents, 
predispositions and interests. So we need to study and 
learn from these. There is no need to make a great effort 
to remember past life events. In our Spirit Soul Self 
absolutely nothing is ever forgotten. But, for now, we only

make a sincere

the

Introspe

Your Introsp

to finding 
the real Self.  We are not alone 
in our 
effort
, our Soul Self and our Guardian 
Archangel 
come 
forward 
to help us with this. 
How long will you have to practice Introspection 
to 
come to that point? 
How long does it take  for water to 
boil?  It depends. 
Llkewise, 
it depends 
on different 
variables 
and just how sincere 
you are with yourself 
in your 
effort 
to unfold spiritually.  Nonetheless, sooner 
or later we 
all 
will 
reach this stage. 
A child of God 
cannot

comes after me, will baptize you in fire and in Spirit." John 
,ms referring to Christ. 
A priest may have baptized some of you with water 
in a Church. During such a baptism, the Holy Spirit 
participates. Baptism by water alone is not enough; we 
need to be baptized in fire and Spirit too. Christ gave and 
will continue to give the baptism of fire and Spirit. We 
have a number of meditation exercises available that lead 
the seeker of truth into that experience. Baptism by water 
takes a few minutes but the baptism by fire and Spirit takes 
centuries. 
Where does this higher baptism take place? 
Wherever you are!  It is a matter of amming to Christ and 
really feeling him. What is the fire you will be baptized in? 
The fire is the Mind vitality and its flames are not burning 
but cleaning and purifying. What is the Spirit you will be 
baptized in?  It comes from feeling and awareness that you 
are the Spirit Soul Self. We cannot continue to exist as the 
prodigal son disempowered in the world of matter. \X"e all 
are prodigal sons and daughter and will never be truly 
satisfied by living in darkness, we must return to the light 
because we are the light!

Would 
you 
please 
expand 
on 
this? 
A. What I was saying is  that everyone from Ophra to 
Chopra says everything is energy. That may be true for 
every THING, but it is not true of a BEING. Because all 
beings, whether an archangelic Being or a Human Being are 
not just energy, we are much, much more than that. 
Energy is not an ungoverned force blindly creating 
everything. There are governors behind all forces of 
Energy and these Governors are Beings.

Absolute Self Awareness. Whereas energy at any level 
from heat, to light, to etheric vitality to cosmic rays to the 
formless Super Substance is a Holy Spiritual expression. 
The Holy Spirit is not a blind force or energy. God is the 
Absolute Selfhood and the Beings in the Absolute Selfhood 
are and express Total Wisdom and Love, which guides, 
shapes and formulates Holy Spiritual energy into all the 
things we find in the Worlds of Existence.

Now say: "I am living in this material body. I am 
living consciously in it. I feel it and I know I am living in 
it, 
yet often I don't feel I am living consciously, I come out of 
inner conscious awareness and enter the wilderness of the 
outer world. 
Now think: "In this moment I live, I feel and I 
think. How does it happen that I am now and I exist? 
Hundreds and thousands of centuries of time have passed. 
Where have I been during all thal Jme? 
If I was not before, how come I am now? Ask: 
"What am I as a human being, as a Soul Self beyond the 
name of my personality and its way of life? I want to 
separate my Self from my personality's way of life. Vow to 
study your way of life and be the master of it, the master of 
your destiny!" 
In our next lesson, we will see how in the past and 
present 
people have found that the "laying of hands" on an 
ill 
person helps and facilitates healing without the "healer" 
knowing exactly why. We will explain what actually is 
occurring in such cases and how to consciously empower 
the process.

However, 
the word 
Psychot
herapis
t is 
really 
not right, because 
it comes 
from 
the 
word 
psyche, 
whic
h means 
the Soul. 
The 
word 
therapy 
means 
a 
trea
tment 
for healing. 
So, technically, 
Psychotherapy 
is an 
incorrect word because the Soul of everyone is pure and 
incorruptible. It is never ill so the Soul is neYer in need of 
healing, which means there are no evil, lost or misguided 
Souls. It is the personality that gets misguided and lost. 
But 
even 
this  only  means 
that 
the light 
of the Soul 
has been 
eclips
ed from the 
personality's 
,'iewpoint. 
:,.;iothing 
bad has

could 
happen 
to the  Soul. 
The 
Soul 
is 
the D

So 
the word 
Psychotherap

wrong
. But

has been gh·en so many names. All the so-called energ
y 
work is using this vitality but calling it different names. 
\'Ce know that this energy is also contained in the air we are 
breathing. In the East they call it Prana. It is Mind in a 
certain range of vibration. Etheric Vitality is the carrier of 
life. 
We have in and around our body and we call it the 
Etheric Double. We give exercises that train how to use it. 
We have disclosed the four natures of this Etheric Double 
the Creative, the Kinetic, the Aesthetic and Imprinting. 
There are other natures that do not concern us at this stage 
so we will not mention them, but they are part of the 
teaching of the Symbol of Life.  We know that the Holy 
Spirit, in building and maintaining the health of the body at 
every moment, uses the Etheric Vitality of the Etheric 
Double. 
The "healer" or Psychotherapist in the past times 
found out an energy that they could not describe was in 
their hands. Well that is where they noticed it first, but 
really it is in the entire Etheric Double of their material 
body. So they found out this energy in their hands could 
do things, and they called their hands "healing hands". 
When they placed their hands on the body of a suffering

By ,

this 
Etheric 
Vitality, 
it can be conveyed 
to others 
and this is 
called absent healing.  There are so many ways to use this 
Vitality, 
but there needs to be training to learn the way to 
charge your hands with  this vitality consciously. So, as 
people working as Psychotherapists will tell you, their 
hand

of energy. 
By that thought

Vitality is real, by using it.  They do that mainly by 
visualization by seeing it, which is not imagination. 
Visualization is done by creative thought. So the 
Psychotherapist should train to see it and also to feel this 
vitality as the aesthetic ether.  Then we must learn how to 
move and transfer it as the kinetic ether.  That is why we 
practice with the Etheric Double to become masters of it as 
imprinting, kinetic and aesthetic ether. Then if it is 
permitted, we can extend our consciousness to higher 
levels and be entrusted with the Creative Ether that is used 
by the Archangels and the Holy Spirit. 
That is what Psychotherapy is and how it is done. So 
a Psychotherapist should always remember that whatever 
healing is done, it is not done by their personality. They are 
only instruments of the Holy Spirit, so even though they 
think they have healing hands it is not their hands that is 
actually doing the work.  It is the Holy Archangels and the 
Holy Spirit. 
It is enough to be a fit conduit for the Holy Spirit's 
work. No one should claim they have cured anyone. 
Daskalos never did and we see that even Christ did not take 
credit for the heatings and miracles, saying that it was the 
father in him that did the works. The power and energy

This also

that it is 
G

an
y 
suc
cessfu
l 
healings 
or unsuccess
ful

ngs 
are 
ac
cording to His will not 
yours. 
Daskalos was adamant that when we work with 
others as Psychotherapists, we disclose nothing and 
promise nothing. We may see those we love very much 
who are suffering and no matter how hard we try, there is 
no cure.  Whereas; others may come to you foe help with 
whom you do not  feel a strong connection and they might 
be completely cured. So it is Thy will, not our will when it 
comes to healing. 
Daskalos  would often set a day aside he called 
Healing Day, which was dedicated to helping those who 
had travelled to Cyprus in hopes of a healing. Of course, 
with Daskalos  every day was a healing day.  Trpicallr on 
Healing Day there could be a short Stoa Lesson and then 
the people seeking cures would come to him one after the 
other. It depended on how many were there seeking 
healings. There were manv different things he did for 
p
eople according to their ailments. But let me narrate cwo 
of these and show how Daskalos would go about helping 
someone who came to him for a healing. 
95 

The person wanting help would go to the front of 
the 
Stoa and typically sit in a chair in front of him. This 
first case was German woman with a serious problem and 
had gone to medical doctors and now came to Daskalos. 
He asked her to tell him a bit about the problem. This lady 
started describing that she had bleeding and the problem 
was associated with her spleen but the doctors told her they 
did not want to operate yet because of complications and 
so advised her to just watch to sec how it progressed. 
Before she had completed telling him this, Daskalos 
declared: "Now this is what we will do. I will try with the 
Visualization to see it properly. I promise you nothing and 
I disclose  nothing. But you must help with this, feel the 
problem going away. If of course your debt is to undergo 
the operation then do it; because maybe it is under the law 
that you get a certain lesson". 
Then he asked her to close her eyes and started to 
flood her with Etheric Vitality and he asked her if she felt 
anything. She said she felt heat. He worked some more 
and 
then announced, "It will take some time". He told her 
and that what she felt now she will feel it every night. 
Daskalos promised he would send her this feeling, this 
Etheric Vitality and see if the problem goes away. 
96 

He 
said
, "It 
might 
go away. 
It might 
go SO% away, 
b
ut 
y
ou 
must 
tr
y 
to help too.  If the 
problem 
does no
t go 
a
wa
y 
it is 
better 
to have the operation 
because 
that is the 
w
ill 
of Go
d".  P
anayiota, 
who was at his side 
assisting 
him, 
re
min
ded the lady 
again 
that she must also 
work with this 
en
ergy 
herself 
and then Daskalos 
added, 
"Every 
night, 
you 
sho
uld 
concentra
te in the area of the problem 
and 
feel 
what you feel now". He was reinforcing the healing 
elemental and asking her to participate by feel the healing 
vibration he had just given her and not the problem. 
So we see in this simple example a little of how he 
worked with the people. We see in this particular case, it 
was  important that the person participate in the cure by 
feel
ing it go 
away and adding 
her energy 
to Daskalos' 
ther
apeutic 
elemental. 
She was to strengthen 
the 
elemental 
b
y 
conce
ntrating 
on it every night, with the feeli
ng of the 
p
rob
lem 
going 
away. 
But you see he never 
promised 
her a 
cu
re 
or 
disclosed 
what really caused 
the prob
lem. 
The 
next lady 
that came forw
ard 
had 
pain 
in 
her 
lo
w
er 
spi
ne. 
For this treatment 
a few of 
the 
clos

and

"This is what I do. I will make it so you will not feel any 
pain." He rubbed his hands over the area on her back 
removing the aesthetic ether. Then he said he would make 
the bones in her spine as soft as rubber and did so. Then 
he asked if anyone wanted to touch them. Some students 
nearby did touch and verified the bones had been softened. 
Then with his material hands he moved the soften bones to 
the right place. While he was doing this he checked to see 
if she felt any pain and then re-solidified the bones in the 
correct alignment. Next, he told her that in order to help 
keep pain away she needs to have more Etheric Vitality in 
her body and advised her to take B-Complex, which 
strengthens the nervous system. So we see in this case 
Daskalos was using all four states of the Etheric Vitality 
and a higher fifth state for the softening of the bones. It all 
took place in just over five minutes. 
Really it was such an experience just to witness all 
this and often it gave me a sense of what it must have felt 
like to be around Christ when he healed hundreds in the 
courtyard of the Essene Synagogues. At one level, it was 
so extraordinary, but he did it in such a simple and 
straightforward way, without any fanfare or drama. After

Aramaic

spoken 
in Palestine 
at 
that 
time most Essenes 
spoke 
both.  The Essenes 
are not 
currently well understood by historians; most of what is 
known has to do with  their library, which contains over 900 
parchment and papyrus scrolls of so-called extra Biblical 
text.  The Essenes had hidden their library from the 
Romans in caves on the west bank of the Dead Sea.  The 
Romans were  killing the Jews and Essenes and in 68 AD 
des
troying 
their settlements. 
So they hid their 
library and it

scrolls in

Luke, Matthew, and Mark. They were ordered to be 
destroyed. Not that all these texts included in the Nag 
Hammadi library proved to be correct, but some of the 
material did.  Now it is interesting to note that both of 
these ancient libraries containing the teaching of Christ 
were revealed immediately after humankind passed through 
the purifying fires of World War II. 
Christ was born in to this Essene community in 
Palestine, but who were these Essenes and where did they 
come from? Going back to the Iron Age in 12th Century 
BC, there was a group called Philistines who originated in 
the Aegean Sea area between what is now Greece and 
Turkey. These were the first people to settle in what is 
now called Palestine. It is now pronounced Palestine 
because of the ancient Romans' mispronunciation of the 
name Philistine. The Philistines were the original settlers in 
this area. Much of the conflict in Palestine today comes 
from the argument that Muslims settled in this area before 
the Jews, which is true. But it was really the Philistines, 
who are linked with the Mycenaean Greeks that were there 
first. So should we say the Greeks should have the right 
claim to this land? 

The 
Philistines were like 
brutes 
and p

In  Europe

ea
ning 
that they are 
an uninfor

n, 
lacking 
in
tell
ectual 
values.  The most 
famous 
P
hilistine 
was 
Goliath 
fro
m the 
David 
and Goliath 
story. 
The Philistines 
that first 
settl
ed in 
this area split into two groups; 
one 
group 
kept 
appea
sing their 
blood-thirsty 
gods with human 
sacrifices 
and the other group rejected this behavior believing in a 
loving God. This group later became what we call the 
Essenes in this area. They were persecuted by the other 
group of Philistines and later by the Jews. 
In ancient Egypt, after the death of Pharaoh 
Akhenaten and the destruction of his one true Spirit - God 
religion, his followers were dispersed and eventually over 
the centuries became the Essenes in Egypt keeping their 
belief in one God. So the Essenes existed long before 
Christ was born. As you know when Christ was born in 
Israel Joseph and Mary had to escape to Eg
y
pt disguised as 
Bedouins because King Herod was killing the new born 
male children in hope he could stop the prophesied coming 
of the Messiah. So they took the Christ child from the 
IOI 

Essene community in Israel to the Essene community in 
Eg
y
pt at Heliopolis. 
This was about 70 years after the Romans had 
defeated the Egyptian Queen, Cleopatra. The Essenes in 
Egypt were speaking Greek, Aramaic and because of the 
Roman presence they were also speaking Latin. When King 
Herod died eleven years later, the Holy  family returned to 
Israel. 
At that time in Israel there ,,,ere three coexisting 
religions: the Essenes Israelites believing in one God who 
was a merciful, loving Spirit-God. There were the Jewish 
Israelites who also believed in one Spirit-God, but theirs 
was a God of Vengeance. So there was a huge difference 
between the God of the Essenes and the God of the Jews. 
Then the third religion was made up of the Idolaters who 
worshiped many man-made gods and idols; these were the 
Romans and the Greeks. 
Christ was teaching in the Greek language to the 
Essenes, but when Israelites came to hear him he also 
taught in Aramaic. Sometimes the Bedouins, living in this 
area, attended Christ's teachings too.  They understood the 
Aramaic language because the Arabic language as well as 
the Hebrew language came from the Aramaic, which had

e
. 
In his teachings, Christ was calling God in 
Manifestation Alaha in Aramaic, Elohim in Hebrew and 
Allah in Arabic for the Bedouins. These names all mean 
the same as what we are calling today Absolute Beingness -
God in its Multiplicity. For God in Its singularity in the 
un-manifested state we say Absolute Be-ness, God the 
Father. In Aramaic and Arabic it was AL, and in Hebrew it 
was  EL. ALAHA is from the old Egyptian and Aramaic 
languages and is one word, but really it is complete 
sentence. As we said, the AL pan means God, the LA 
means the Will-Pleasure of God and the HA pan means 
the Divine Plan. So this one word sentence is saiing "God 
expresses his Will and Pleasure through the Dhine Plan". 
The old Egyptian language is so rich and deep. None of 
the languages today have such full meanings in just one 
w
ord.

So 
most 
of 
the 
New 
Test
a
ment 
103 

was first written in Greek and then translated into Aramaic 
and then back into Greek before it was translated into 
other languages. When the Bible was first translated into 
English it was done from a Greek bible.  At that time there 
were about 254 different version of the Bible. But the 
translator only had access to one version of the Greek 
Bible and so he only used that one.  So this is where the 
original King James Version of the Bible came from. 
Now the Essenes in Palestine thought of the Jews as 
their brothers even though the Jews believed in a vengeful 
God.  Essenes believe in much of the Jewish scriptures but 
made reforms in them by throwing out the parts of about 
the angry God who approved of human sacrifices, selling 
your daughter into slavery under certain conditions and 
stoning your son to death for disobedience. If we followed 
this law today, no one would have a son. 
Unfortunately, these ridiculous parts are still 
included in our current Bible. So today's Bible is a 
mismatched marriage of the Old Testament with the Jewish 
belief in a vengeful God and the New Testament with the 
Essenes and Christ's teaching of a loving, merciful God. 
When Christ came he confirmed the Essene 
teachings of a non-vengeful loving God and specifically set

He gave this fundam
en
t
al 
teaching 
a
t a
ge 
seven. 
This was 
carved 
on a stone and 
placed 
on the 
altar 
in the Essene 
temple 
of Heliopoli
s and later in 
Israel. 
All 
these reforms 
by the Essenes 
made the 
Jews 
consider 
them heretics 
and easily found reasons 
to stone 
them to death and justified it under the Mosaic Law.  Of 
course they crucified Joshua under these laws.  Even at the 
crucifixion of Christ we see Caiaphas the Head Priest of the 
Jewish Sanhedrin taunting Christ on the Cross saying, "He 
helpe
d all the others, 
and yet he is not able to help 
himself, 
now.
"  So after the crucifixion 
some people 
started 
cla
iming 
Christ 
was just 
a man 
who lost his 
powers 
and 
had 
w
eak
ness like all 
other men.  However, 
for the 
Essenes and 
t
ho
se 
who 
unders
tood, this was not a 
weakness 
bu
t 
the 
v
ic
tory 
of the 
God-Man. 
By his Resurr
ection
, he 
was 
p
rov
ing 
the 
truth of 
his teachings: 
\X'e are an 
eternal 
Sp
irit 
S
oul 
and not just a material 
body. 
There are many places in tbe New Testament where 
J
oshua foretold of his coming crucifixion. His disciple 
105 

Peter asked him, "What don't you go to Syria so you will 
not be under the authority of the Jews of the Sanhedrin?" 
Christ replied, "It is for this hour I have come." Christ also 
advised, "don't fear those who can kill the body; they can 
do nothing to the Soul." 
As he had foreseen and told his disciples the 
Sanhedrin would wound his body horribly and crucified it. 
Then after the resurrection he would come to his disciples 
and stay with them for 50 days showing them the wounds 
on his body from the crucifixion and eat with them, 
proving in a practical way the truth of his teaching: that the 
body is not the Self. 
But is that great truth really understood by Christians 
today? He was not diminishing the importance of the 
material body - he called it a temple of God and so it is. 
He was also trying to help us understand that we are also 
an eternal god that lives in this temple. As God is in the 
temple of our material body He is also in our personality as 
the Soul. 
What Daskalos and the Researchers of Truth are 
teaching is not from imagination but from knowledge and 
direct experience. It is what other enlightened masters 
have taught in the past and was confirmed by Christ. He

So 
tonigh
t we 
will 
hear an 
ex
am
p
le, in 
today's 
language 
and terms, 
of 
what Jo
s
hua 
was 
tea
ching the 
Essenes almost 2000 
years 
ago. 
He taught that the Absolute Infinite Reality is the 
Absolute Infinite  Beingness that He called Alaha. Alaha 
had both the Will and Pleasure to manifest Itself within 
Itself. The un-manifested God, the Absolute Be-ness, is 
beyond anyone's ability to understand. Christ was reaching 
this to all his many disciple-healers, calling God - His father 
and everyone's father. Addressing the Essenes and 
Israelites calling them children of God he said in Greek, 
"Tekna Theou" and in Aramaic he called them, "Beni 
Alaha." 
He said 
to them, 
"God the Father sent 
you as 
Spirit­
So
uls, 
as a ray of life 
to live as human 
beings.  A 
Met
at
hrone 
unified his 
ray of Spirit with 
yours 
and be
came 
y
our 
Guar
dian 
Angel. Eve
ry 
one of 
you has a 
Guard
ian 
A
n
gel." 
Alaha 
said to the se
ven 
orders of 
the 
Arch
angels
, 
"
Let 
us 
create man 
in our image and 
liken
ess
."  W
hich 
107 

means the human being is a creation, a creature. "Made in 
our image and likeness," means a human being is god too. 
Co-vibrating 
with the Will-Pleasure of God to create 
a human being these Holy Archangels created human 
beings in the image and likeness of God - not in some 
lesser form. Christ was also giving the persuasion to his 
listeners, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in 
heaven is perfect." If humans were not made in the image 
and likeness of God then this wnuld not be possible. If it 
was not possible then Christ would not have said that it 
was. 
So using the Mind Super-Substance the Archangels 
materialized the human form as matter, ether, Psychical 
substance and Noetical substance creating his three bodies. 
These three bodies are mortal, whereas the higher form of 
the Spirit-Self and the Soul-Self are immortal. A human 
being is an imperishable Spirit-Self and Soul-Self. 
To help understand the difference between the Spirit 
and the Soul, Daskalos has given this example of sunlight 
coming through an open window. The light from the sun 
coming to the window is exactly the same as the light 
coming from the window to the floor leaving the shape of 
the window on the floor.  The light from the sun to the 
108 

w
i
n
do
w 
is 
the 
Spirit and 
the light from 
the 
wind
ow to 
the 
fl
o
or  is 
the Soul. The window is the 
arch
etyp
e of 
the 
H
um
an 
Idea 
and it is 
giving a kind of shape 
and 
defini
tion 
to 
th
e ray 
of the Spirit 
as it forms the 
Soul. 
The light 
on 
th
e 
floor is the 
personality-self. 
If the 
floor is 
light in 
color 
it 
will 
reflect much 
light in the room. 
However, 
if the 
floor 
is 
dark in color 
it will not reflect much light in 
the room. 
So 
too if 
our personality 
is darkened 
by fear, anxiety 
and 
negativity, not much light of our Spirit-Soul will be 
reflected. 
The personality-self, according to the laws governing 
its place in the Worlds of Existence is changing all the time. 
Saint Paul said, "Every day I die."  The personality's 
material 
body is    also changing 
and will not li
ve  for a long 
time. 
In fact 
it is dying in some ways every day 
too.  Our 
hu
man body has 
been an embryo in the womb, a 
baby boy 
or 
girl, 
small child, a teenager, 
an adult and all 
the 
way 
t
hro
ugh 
old age and 
death it is changing
.  We all 
have to 
foll
ow the 
Circle of Possibilities 
for a 
human 
being. 
Today, 
medical science tells us the 
every cell 
in 
our 
m
a
terial body 
is regenerated 
within 
seven 
yea
rs. 
If 
our 
e
nti
re b
ody 
gets 
brand new cells 
every 
seven 
y
ears
, then 
w
hat 
is aging? 
So the material 
body is 
ch
angi
ng, cha
nging 
109 

up to the point of its death. But our material body is not 
our self. Material bodies all may be similar but everyone's 
personality is different from one another. That personality­
self as the emotions, thoughts, desires and weaknesses that 
compose the egoism never stops changing and it is not our 
real Self. At its core is a ray of the real Spirit-Soul Self, 
which enables the personality to live. Our job is to learn to 
be able to distinguish the difference between the two. 
In our practice of Introspection, we use our Divine 
Nature, as Observation, and real Will Power to help us 
distinguish the difference between our real Self and its 
fluctuating reflection as the personality-self. What usually 
passes for willpower is an obstinacy coming of a man or a 
woman's egoism. This is not to be confused with the 
Soul's Divine Will-Power. People can push other people 
and things around with obstinacy, trying to force certain 
outcomes and call that willpower if they want. But that is 
not the real Will and Power of the Soul we speak of.  So 
real Will Power is not in the hands of the personality, it is 
one of the characteristics of the Soul. 
What can real Will Power do? Christ used it when 
he materialized the bread and fish to feed over 5000 
people. It took him more than two hours to accomplish 
110

That great work is only 
possibl
e, 
because 
as 
He said, we are all gods. 
Christ was saying that Alaha, God, is the Everlasting 
Life and the Everlasting Light. This light is a reference to 
something much, much more than the just the physical 
light we can see with our eyes. He taught that all of the 
Worlds of Existence, and everything in them, have been 
created by the Archangels of the Elements using this 
inextinguishable Divine Light in different degrees of 
luminosity. Some degrees of this radiant Light gi,·e the 
ethereal, the Psychical and N oetical World. The degrees of 
brightness give us different kingdoms of creation: the 
mineral kingdom, the plant kingdom and the animal 
kingdom. 
So what kind of Light is in the human beings?

ist 
said

Christ made this part of the teaching very practical 
to the Essenes saying, "You are now my disciple-healers, 
and you should know that all degrees of the luminosity are 
in you, manifested as consciousness." He taught them 
about the seven levels of consciousness we have spoken 
about before. These are the sensitivity, the sensibility, the 
instinct, and the Sub-Consciousness. The waking 
consciousness, which most people think they are 
expressing but very few are expressing fully alert, waking 
consciousness. Christ was teaching ways to unfold, in us, 
our real Self-Consciousness, which is a still higher state of 
consciousness. He was saying we can and should develop 
the Self-Super Consciousness. This is a vast awareness way 
beyond what we perceive through the five senses. 
Now a few of his advanced disciples, such as Philip 
learned this kind of expansion of consciousness and could 
use this "Spirit Power''. How do we know that for sure? 
There is an account of this in the Bible, where Philip was 
sitting under a fig tree with Nathanael in Bethsaida and 
Joshua was in Jerusalem many miles away. Philip felt and 
heard Christ there with them. Then when Christ came to 
Bethsaida he confirmed that to Philip saying, "When you 
were under the fig tree with Nathanael, I have seen you and 
112 

I 
h
ave 
heard 
you".

On 
the

was 
a chariot

to the

of 
Ethiopia. 
Philip 
materialized 
a body 
there 
and 
sat next to a man in the chariot
, 
who was the 
Q
ueen's 
treasurer. At the time the man was alone and reading from 
the prophet Isaiah tr)�ng to understand it. Philip asked the 
man if he understood what he was reading and the 
astonished fellow said, "How can I understand master 
without 
someone 
explaining 
it to me?" 
So Philip 
s

about 
Christ.

told

So Philip was a great mystic who was able to unfold 
the Super-Consciousness within him and entered the fifth 
heaven, the Noetical World.  Then he was able to 
concentrate in order to lower his vibrations to the point of 
being able to materialize and enter into a physical body and 
speak to the Ethiopian. He was able to do all that not just 
by learning about the technique but through At-One-Ment 
with what he was as a Spirit-Soul. This kind of 
consciousness is difficult to even imagine as a personality. 
It is Self-Super-Consciousness -the highest level of 
consciousness. In the heaven of the Noetical World, 
knowing occurs through proper coordination, which means 
a perfect co-vibration between two things: Between you 
and the object or condition you are coordinating with. 
Christ was also teaching his disciples how to enter 
the highest state of Divine Oneness, unfolding their self by 
attuning to their real Spirit-Soul Self.  This is entering a 
Divine state of oneness; it is not a mundane state. 
Reaching this state means you as the Prodigal Son have 
returned back home. 
Before 
and after the time of Christ there have 
been 
many who have reached that state of oneness with God. 
Now we come to an important distinction between the 
114 

t
ea
c
hing 
of 
Christ 
and certain 
teachings 
in the East.  In 
the 
Ea
stern 
Spiritu
al systems 
there is 
m
u
ch talk 
abo
u
t 
lib
era
tion, and 
they place 
a strong 
accent 
on 
escaping from 
t
he K
armic 
cycle of death 
and birth -
nothing 
wrong 
with 
th
at.  But 
just to escape, 
to save you
r
self and 
leave yo
u
r 
fell
ow 
human 
beings 
behind 
suffering 
in the 
worlds 
of 
illu
sion is not our 
aim.  The Will Pleasure 
of the 
Logos 
is 
for 
us to 
shoulder 
our burdens 
and the burdens 
of 
those 
weaker than us. 
So if you manage to reach such Divine states, 
becoming one with the Logos you will be co-vibrating with 
His Will-Pleasure. His Will Pleasure becomes your own 
Will Pleasure to come back down to ser
v
e -  even entering 
into a dark hell to help those who are trapped and 
suffering. This is not a sacrifice because eYen in the 
darkest hells there is Light and God is omnipresent; equally 
present  everywhere. So because these brothers and sisters 
of mercy  are Self-Conscious, they are with God in His 
omnipresence and do not feel separated even in the hells. 
This is the highest meaning of Christ teaching of, 
"There is no greater love than this: that a person would lay 
down his life for the sake of his friends". Don't think this 
only means their material life.  This laying down your life in 
115 

ser
v
ice is done in each of the three Worlds of Existence the 
material,  Psychical and Noetical. So even by reaching the 
highest consciousness, your love for God and your fellow 
human beings will call you back to re-enter the Worlds of 
Existence as an awakened brother or sister of mercy and 
continue to lay down your life in service for your friends. 
At this level of consciousness, your friends consist of each 
and every human being. 
Eventually all can do this if they choose, because 
everyone is an offspring of God. According to Joshua's 
parable about the prodigal son, sooner or later we all have 
to return back home to our Divine Nature. 
So it is the ray of the immortal Spirit-Soul-Self that 
has caused the appearance of our mortal self in space, time 
and place. This mortal self has been given the right to use 
material, Psychical and Noetical substance. It is to be used 
to reach knowledge and real understanding. But too often 
we have used it in creating strong, often uncontrolled, 
emotions and desires causing jealousies, hatreds, and 
fighting. In other words, we have abused this Mind Vitality 
by creating negative elementals, which darkly cover the 
pulse of life of our Spirit-Soul Self. This ends up 
producing a personality that suffers a lot.

that

Origen 
(185 - 254 
AD), 
an early Spiritual 
giant and 
considered 
one of the first and greatest  Church Fathers 
taught, 
"Each  Soul  enters 
the world 
streng

by the 
victories 
or weakened 
by the defects 
of its past lives. Its 
place 
in this world 
is determined 
by past ,�rrues 
and 
shortcomings." 
This means 
that in every incarnation 
we 
are creating 
a living collection 
of elementals 
by our good 
and not so good 
thoughts, 
desires 
and actions.

personality-selves that you love so Yery much but also gave 
you pain are there as a living recording so nothing is lost. 
It 
is living because it is made of Mind Vitality. 
So the life of your personality that you created in 
each past incarnation becomes like a book, you have 
written, which  resides on a shelf in the  library of the 
Cosmic  Memory. As a Soul, you have a right to pick up 
any of these written books and go through it again and 
enjoy what was enjoyable. Once you reach the state of Self­
Super-Consciousness you can re-experience any past 
incarnations by atruning to it.  So again nothing is lost in 
reaching the state Joshua spoke of as being as perfect as 
your heavenly father. 
In that Divine state of consciousness, a mystic will 
use At-One-Ment with God and attunement to past lives or 
anything else they want to know. That Divine state is 
reachable by those who become master of Visualization, 
Introspection, the right Meditation and can manifest their 
divine power of Observation. 
We are given the Mind Vitality as our daily bread. 
Just as we feed our material body by eating, we are to use 
the daily bread of the Mind Vitality to feed our Psychical 
and Noetical bodies. A Researcher of Truth evenrually

Questions 
Q. Is the Spirit Human Form the same as our 
Spirit-Soul-Ego-Self? 
A. The Spirit Human Form is the same as our 
Spirit-Soul-Self - But it is not exactly the same as our 
Spirit-Ego Self. The Spirit-Ego-Self is prior to its 
expression as a Spirit-Soul-Ego Self. The archetypal 
Human Idea is what gives definition to the ray of Spirit and 
that definition is the Soul. But when we say the Spirit 
Human Form without mentioning the Soul it is a reference 
to the fact that even before the formation of the Soul, our 
Spirit Ego had the Human Form in it as its own property -
but in an unexpressed state. That means the Spirit Egos 
(Ego here means I-ness not egoism) of human beings were 
according to the Divine Plan, pre-destined to be 
humanized. So in this way we can say that they have and 
will always have the human form but un-manifested, 
unexpressed until that ray of our Spirit Ego passes through 
the Human Idea, the Idea of the Heavenly Man archetype. 
At which point the Soul, which always was in the Spirit 
Ego, makes its appearance. Now we can call it the Spirit­
Soul-Ego-Self. 

Q. Daskalos, 
Dr. Atteshlis, 
speaks of two other 
bodies we have with 
us.  Are these the Psychical 
and 
No
etical bodies? 
A. Yes the other two bodies beyond the material 
body he mentioned 
are the Psychical 
and Noetical 
bodies. 
Remember the 
Human 
Form itself is not a bod
y. 
It is a 
form with definition 
but it is literally everywhere. 
Its ray, 
the ray the Spirit Soul Self is dressed in a Noetical, 
Psychical 
and material 
body for its incarnations 
in the three 
worlds of Existence 
- Material, 
Psychical 
and Noetical. 
Q. These two bodies are identical 
to the bodv we 
have in the current incarnation, 
right? 
A. Yes they are identical 
but exist at a higher 
vibratory 
level.  They are more malleable 
to our thoughts, 
which mean we can change the appearance 
of these bodies 
by our thoughts. 
Q. What happens 
to these Spirit bodies 
when the,· 
have passed through 
all the worlds of Existence' 
A.

three 
bodies the material,

Meditation 
This is an exercise we have done before and Joshua 
Immanuel the Christ gave this practice in Greek to the 
Essenes.  Greek was the mother language of the Essenes 
living in Biblical Palestine. We will use the corresponding 
English words and terms of today. 
First relax completely and open your heart to God. 
The body is yours, not you. The holy Archangels and the 
Holy Spirit are sustaining it now.  They give you the right 
to use it as your own.  It is your own: It is the temple of 
God - of God and of your Being-Self. 
Make this temple of God a congregation of angelic 
elementals. Take away from this temple all human demons 
as evil elementals: jealousy, evil beha,�or, weaknesses, 
unbridled desires and emotions. 
Keep 
as a 
congregation 
in this temple, in  your 
body, 
hu
man 
angels; good elementals. Create 
only 
good 
ele
me
ntals in the 
light of love.  In every templ
e there is 
the 
Ho
ly 
of 
Holies. Make 
your heart the 
Holy 
of 
Holies 
of 
Go
d. 
In 
the 
Holy 
of Holies there is also 
the 
altar.

is

altar. 
123 

Now, light another flame in this lamp. This one is 
rnur personality's lm·e to God and to all human beings 
around you. Don't allow those flames to flicker. Keep the 
flames steady and strong. It is a perfect light. Live with 
these two flames of lm·e on the altar of your heart. The 
Holy Archangels are li,·ing in your heart. You are living too. 
Your life is the pulse of Life. 
Our next lesson will be on Archangels and Arch 
demons, the so-called fallen angels, and explain how thev 
can and cannot affect human beings. We will disclose 
much that has not been spoken about before in books and 
by other Spiritual systems. Moreover we will show how the 
human in nature demons created by human beings are 
more dangerous to human beings than the true demons 
coming from the fallen angels. And what we can do to 
protect ourselves.

Chapter 5 
SEV
EN 
S
HADOWS 
OF THE 
LIGHT 
O
ne day 
C
hrist and his disciples 
were 
leaving 
B
eth
any in the morning and were 
hu
ngry. 
They 
saw 
a fig 
tre
e in 
the 
distance and went there to 
find if 
there 
was any 
fru
it. 
But upon 
reaching 
the fig tree they saw 
it only had 
lea
ves on the 
tree but no figs.  Christ said to 
the tree, 
"May 
yo
u never 
bear fruit again".  The tree withered down 
and 
died, to the amazement of the disciples. 
This account was reported in the Synoptic Gospels 
of l\fatthew, Mark and Luke and ever since, people have 
asked the question, "�'hy did Christ curse the fig tree"? 
Now, 
you will recall that Christ and the people of that time 
we 
were talking 
about evil Spirits.  Today people generically 
refer 
to them as 
negative 
thought forms and the 
mystics 
call 
them 
destructive 
elementals. 
Elementals 
are power 
form
s that have a purpose 
and life of their 
own. 
Archa
ngel also cast elementals but those 
are fully 
cr
ea

these are 
called angels.  Human

ether is not under the control of the common person. 
The human beings create the so-called evil Spirits or 
destructive elementals. 
We know elementals can enter humans, animals and 
plants but they can also be affixed to inanimate objects. 
These elementals can be holy, good, not so good, or 
downright destructive. A master, a saint or anyone who 
knows how can bless an object and place a beneficial 
elemental on it.  Daskalos implanted beneficial elementals 
in the paintings he made and blessed small gold and silver 
talismans for the seekers of truth who sought his help. 
When really bad occurrences happen in a location, 
the negative elemental that was created by the event often 
attaches itself to a bush or a tree in that area. Sensitive 
people can feel that. That is what happened in the case of 
the fig tree.  There was a very bad elemental in that tree and 
that is why the fig tree was no longer producing figs. How 
does  this happen? If the nature Spirit of a .bush or tree 
does not accept a bad elemental, the nature Spirit in the 
tree will  leave and the tree will  die. But if the nature  Spirit 
does  allow the bad elemental to enter, the tree will go on 
living but not produce any fruit. 
Christ saw that the bad elemental in the fig tree was 
126

C
hrist did 
not 
curse 
an innocent 
fig 
tree. 
On 
Cyp
rus, 
when 
Daskalos 
saw such 
a tree 
with an 
a
ttac
hed 
harmful 
elemental, 
he tried 
chasin
g it 
away 
with
out 
destroying 
the tree. 
Then 
he reported 
that the 
n
ature 
Spirit 
in the bush 
or tree felt relief.  That 
is 
becaus
e, 
the 
nature 
Spirits 
do not 
enjoy 
being 
dominated 
by negative 
elementals. 
We see this same thing when Christ was seventeen 
and went to Gadara and saw the naked man possessed by 
what they called evil Spirits or demons. Again these are the 
harmful  elementals, which have been created by human 
beings they are not true demons. This poor fellow had 
su
ch a  large 
group 
of negative 
elementals 
on 
him that it 
ga
ve 
him great 
power. 
He had 
so much

th
e 
p

wild

he broke

nightsticks but could not stop him and he started to stand 
up and so three or four policemen all jumped on him at 
once and brought him down back down to the  floor. The 
man stood right back up and threw them all off much to 
their surprise. 
We have probably all felt or have seen something 
similar but to a much lesser degree. When anger rises up in 
someone they often feel greatly empowered. So beware of 
the feeling of empowerment when anger arises - especially 
with the erroneously called "righteous anger". 
Now when Christ approached the possessed man in 
Gadara, he asked who are you and the possessed man 
spoke, "My name is Legion; for we are many''. At that time 
the word legion was a reference to a group of about 5000 
roman soldiers. So this account is revealing that this man 
was being controlled by a massive number of similar 
elementals that formed into one large group - a   legion of 
elementals. 
This possessed man spent most of his time in tombs, 
crying and cutting himself with stones. Today we hear 
about tormented teenagers repeatedly cutting themselves 
too. Upon seeing Christ coming, the man initially ran to 
him calling Christ the Son of God and pleaded with him 
128 

not to cast them out in to the darkness. There was a heard 
of about 2000 pigs nearby and the evil Spirits beseeched 
Christ asking to be sent into the heard of pigs. Christ then 
commanded the unclean Spirits to go into the heard of 
pigs. But when they went into the pigs the pigs reacted 
violently, ran down a steep slope into the sea and drowned 
themselves. Here we see that the  nature Spirits of the pigs 
would not tolerate these torturous elementals and 
destr
oyed 
themselves
.  They 
committed 
suicide 
like pe
o
ple 
do  when they become tortured and dominate by ,·ery 
negative elementals. When the people that shepherded the 
pigs saw this they ran away in fear and told the town what 
had happened. The town went to Jesus and seeing the 
posses
sed man 
now 
dressed 
and calm 
they 
were

people.  They get it from animals and to a lesser degree 
plants.  Again why?  The blood of humans carries great 
quantities of etheric vitality, and so does the blood in 
animals. Plants have a corresponding element to blood 
called sap, which flows through the plant like blood does in 
humans and animals. So the elementals seek the energy of 
plants, animals or humans to remain active. 
Why do you think in the distant past people were 
performing human and animal sacrifice? Certain groups of 
very bad elementals like blood.  They demanded blood 
sacrifice and they influenced the ancient people to make 
these blood sacrifices. The Jews, the Greeks, the Aztecs, 
the Maya, and the Inca were all making human sacrifices in 
past times.  The Aztecs did it to such a great extent that 
during these massive human sacrifice ceremonies blood 
freely flowed down the steps of their pyramids and ran in 
the streets. 
Fortunately for the Aztecs towards the end of their 
reign they had a wise Shaman who convinced the Aztec 
leader to stop the blood sacrifices and replace them by 
offering flowers on the fire to their god of the sun.  We 
should not say more about the blood and elementals, 
except to say that blood is under the authority of the Holy 
130 

Sp
ir
it. 
C
hrist 
referred to his blood 
as 
wine. 
Why 
wine? 
W
in

more

Not 
that we 
should 
drink wine 
for 
that 
reason.  Bu
t 
as 
a 
sy
mbol 
for 
Christ's blood 
it does 
have 
meaning 
behind 
it. 
As we said negative 
elementals 
can get attached 
to 
plants and trees. 
Have 
you ever heard 
of the suicide 
forest 
outside 
Tokyo? 
There 
is a national 
forest on the northwest 
side of Mount 
Fuji. 
It is a beautiful 
place and the old forest 
is so dense  it 
is often 
called 
"the sea of trees". 
Because 
of 
this, inside 
the forest 
is hauntingly 
quiet and no sounds 
from outside 
forest 
can be heard. 
It is also known 
as "the 
perfect 
place 
to die ".  Every 
year over 70 people 
go there to 
commit 
suicide 
and have for centuries. 
The government 
has nailed 
si
gn
s throughout 
the forest 
that read "Please 
reconsider" 
and "Please 
consult 
the police 
before you 
decide 
to  die!"  But  that 
has not stopped 
the suicides. 
Now 
cons
ider the fig tree story again and 
we can see 
u
n
derl

cause. 
Llke the  fig tree, the

from centuries of suicides and that has an influence on 
people. But that is all it is, only influence; the force of this 
self-destructive influence is exerted only on people that 
already think about suicide so they are attuned with this 
influence. The suicide forest is considered the most 
haunted location in Japan, where unsettled ghosts of the 
suicides howl in their suffering. 
But, as we teach, ghosts are primarily elementals. 
Only occasionally and only for a :hart time, can they be a 
dis-incarnated person harboring very strong Earthly 
attachments that bind them temporarily to the etheric 
counterpart of Earth. Fortunately, there is always a pull 
upward on the Earth bound spirit of a dis-incarnated 
person that prevents them from staying Earth bound for 
long. Eventually they feel they do not belong here and are 
pulled away from the etheric counterpart of Earth. 
In other Virtual Circle lessons we have described 
that God, the Absolute Be-Ness, like colorless light, passes 
through the prism of the Will-Pleasure of manifestation to 
present the Beings that compose what is now called 
Absolute Beingness. This prism of Will-Pleasure gives us 
the archangelic Orders. Then there is a cooperation and 
combination among them to create the beautiful universes: 
132 

the Noetic, Noetical, Psychical and material universes. 
These Holy Archangels also project parts of themselves as 
the angels and nature Spirits of many different classes that 
are the intelligences behind the plants and animals. These 
archangelic Beings are doing their individual work yet they 
are still in the oneness of God. 
Now, at the same time, which was always, some of 
these Eternal Spirit Beings circumvent this classification via 
the prism of God's Will-Pleasure. These are the Fallen 
Ones.  They ignore the Logos and Holy Spirit and cover 
themselves in darkness, believing that they are superior to 
God.  This act disadvantages them.  It robs them of the 
brilliance of their light as sons of the light and creates 
darkness in them.  In truth darkness is not an absolute 
realiry but it does exist.  It exists in these so-called Fallen 
Ones or Fallen Angels. Now there is an archangelic class 
that you might call a twin flame to the Fallen Ones but this 
cla
ss has always 
remained Holy Archangels. This 
Archangel's vibration gives his name, which in Latin is 
Lucifer. His name literally means "Carrier of the Light". 
L
uc
ifer is not a 
devil he is an Archangel 
of 
Light but in 
ex
pr
ession in 
the worlds of separateness 
his powers create 
t
he 
se
nse of evil. 
As a teacher of duality he 
provides the 
133 

necessary conditions for us to understand duality -to 
understand the concepts of good and evil. That is what 
good and evil are: concepts that we find as conditions in· 
the material, Psychical and Noetical World. As long as we 
are in these three worlds of Existence we will always find 
conditions of duality and the opposite concepts of good 
and evil. But "evil' only exists up to the lower Noetical 
World. The perception of good and evil loses its meaning 
in the higher Noetical planes. At this level the concept of 
evil is replaced by the understanding of evil as undeveloped 
good. This is a difference between religions such as 
Christianity,Judaism, and Islam, with Hinduism. In 
Hinduism they tend not to personify evil is some anti-god 
called the devil. They simply refer to the idea of evil as 
ignorance - ignorance of the truth. 
Lucifer projects an Angel whose name in Aramaic is 
Sham El, which means he who has the light.  But 
symbolically we can say that Shamel has one of his hands 
connected to Lucifer, the carrier of the light, and the other 
hand is extended to the real demons. 
These fallen ones project out Arch Demons. This is 
exactly what the Sanhedrin accused Christ of being: an 
Arch Demon, a prince of demons because he could cast 
134 

out  demons from people. When accused of being an Arch 
Demon, Christ said, "Every kingdom divided against itself 
is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided 
against  itself shall not stand. If Satan cast out Satan, he is 
divided against  himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?" 
The worst of class of all Arch Demons is covered in 
a cocoon of seven  veils of darkness.  I will not mention this 
order's name. There are a great  number of these kinds. 
Arch Demons, which project out their kind of elementals, 
which become the other classes of demons. Demons of 
such things as hatred and avarice also have other demons 
around them. Daskalos is the  first to reveal such details. 
There is light in all the worlds of Existence as we 
spoke about before and in Absolute Bein
gn
ess there is the 
everlasting light. But the billions of Fallen Ones have 
circumvented, by their own free will, God's classification 
and that causes them to be wrapped in these veils of 
dar
kness. Just as we have 
the  seven degrees 
ofluminosi
ty 
of the light, there are also seven veils of darkness.  Their 
vibrations in the different degrees of darkness in their veils 
als
o 
cause a 
sound, which gives them their 
different names. 
No 
need 
to 
mention the names of these 
unclean orders. 
Can these  Fallen Ones use the lvlind as the 
135 

Archangels do?  No not exactly but they have their own 
kind of expression. The Holy Spirit rejects them and that 
deprives them of the creativeness the Archangels have. 
They simply cannot use the Mind and materialize - thank 
God. Nobody has ever seen a true demon materialize. If 
demons were allowed to use the Mind you can be assured 
they would be materializing themselves in physical forms all 
the time. 
So, having violated the Divine Laws, they drop and 
enter the worlds of Existence as transgressors. They dwell 
in the etheric counterpart of the material world, the 
Psychical Worlds; all the way up to the lower Noetical 
World but cannot go any higher. Here in the etheric 
counter parts of these worlds the Archangels tolerate them 
but they cannot enter directly into these worlds, which have 
been created by the Archangels. 
Keep in mind, the human being is a god and not a 
fallen one or a demon. But the Fallen Ones can influence 
and affect human beings. We said that the elementals that 
are cast by the Holy Archangels are the Angels and through 
them all the forms of life are created and they continue 
creating more of their own kind. But elementals cast by the 
human beings do not create living forms. Humans can 
136 

cr
eate an 
elemental 
and 
build 
on that 
to develop 
things 
like 
t
ele
visions, 
computers 
and 
rockets. 
But 
there 
is 
no  life 
in 
th
e  things 
mankind 
creates. 
This leads us to the question, "What can the 
elementals cast by the Fallen Ones do"? Nothing, but 
influence the already existing elementals of human beings. 
These elementals from the fallen ones do not get a form so 
they are  not visible. Again this is because the Holy Spirit 
has rejected the Fallen Ones and deprived to create forms. 
But their elementals have a  power, a power to strengthen 
the negative elementals of human  beings making them 
worse. The dark robed Fallen  Ones  remain very miserable 
beings  until  they recognize their transgressions. 
Now when an evil Spirit, a negative elemental, is 
projected from a human being at the location of the third 
eye it moves about in the locality where it was projected 
then  returns  back to that  person  drawing with it seven 
more evil Spirits worse  than itself. 
Christ revealed all that in his parable called "The 
Unclean Spirit", which states, "When an unclean Spirit goes 
out of a man, it travels through dry places,  seeking rest, but 
does  not find rest". 
Then 
it says
, I 
will 
return 
into 
the 
house 
from 
where 
137 

I came 
out; 
and 
when 
it returns 
finds 
the house 
empty 
and 
unguarded. 
Then 
it goes 
in and 
takes 
with 
it seven 
other 
Spirits 
more 
wicked 
than 
itself, 
and 
they 
enter 
in and 
dwell 
there: 
and 
the last state 
of that 
man 
is worse 
than 
the first". 
Christ 
referred 
to the personality 
of man 
as a house. 
These 
unclean 
Spirits 
enter 
the personality 
through 
the 
Etheric 
Double 
specifically 
through 
the main 
seven 
chakras 
or energy 
centers. 
The 
unclean 
Spirit 
is a negative 
elemental. 
The 
seven 
other 
Spirits 
that 
return 
with 
it and 
enter 
the man's 
personality 
are also 
elementals. 
The 
question 
is where 
does 
that 
one 
unclean 
Spirit 
find 
these 
seven 
other 
elementals 
worse 
that 
itself? 
Well 
they 
could 
be elementals 
that 
have 
been 
projected 
by other 
human 
beings. 
But 
tbe projected 
elemental 
can just as well 
gather 
these 
seven 
Spirits 
from 
among 
the elementals 
created 
by the Fallen 
Ones. 
So the 
Fallen 
Ones 
can and 
do influence 
a personality 
if and 
only 
if that 
personality 
is in tune 
with 
them. 
Wben 
we feel 
anger 
for example, 
we are attuning 
to them 
without 
know 
it.  So 
we are receiving 
back 
the elementals 
we have 
created, 
which 
are now 
strengthened 
by the Fallen 
Ones. 
Wben 
this happens 
is it a true 
demonic 
possession? 
No. 
Have 
no 
fear, 
because 
no Fallen 
One 
or Demon 
can 
take 
possession 
138 

of our material, Psychical or Noetical body. Nor can they 
possess the body of a plant or animal. All bodily forms are 
Holy Spiritual in nature and thus under the care and 
protection of the Holy Archangels. What can get 
possession and control human beings are their own 
elementals. So we are responsible and fully capable of de­
energizing the elementals we create.  Nobody is too weak 
to do this. 
Do you consider these Fallen Ones are Intelligent? 
Actually in some ways they are dumber than animals, but in 
other  ways no human can deceive them. Remember the 
old saying: "If you dance with the devil the dev
i
l always 
ends up leading". It's like that. What they do have is the 
power, the ability to exert influences to confuse, deceive 
and induce the dissolution of good things. 
Now the elementals created by human beings are 
intelligent to a degree.  They get part of the intelligence of 
the person who projected it.  The destructive ones can 
influence and Psychologically cripple their creator if left 
unchecked. So we should be very alert to what we send out 
of us and what we are receh-ing back. But the elementals 
t
o watch out for are the ones we are projecting and not the 
dark energies of the pitiful Fallen Ones. We do feel pity 
139 

for these very unhappy 
beings that have lost their sense 
of 
their real nature as beings and gained a sense of self, as an 
evil Existence. 
Everyone 
has some negative 
thoughts 
and feelings 
that when eliminated 
lighten the personaliry. 
Introspecting 
on this, the first thing we shall find is a general group 
elemental, 
which is pretending 
to be only good.  But in fact 
it is composed 
of both good and bad elementals. 
This is 
the general egoism of our person.:;,y, 
which runs 
the show 
too much of the time.  Is that egoism intelligent? 
It thinks 
it is.  It can be very cunning, 
but it stupidly thinks 
the real 
you cannot discover 
it.  But clearly the egoism of our 
personality 
is not so intelligent. 
We make the bi
gge
st 
mistakes 
and create the bi
gg
est messes for our self, and 
others, when 
we act from our egoism. 
Egoism makes a lousy guide and deceiving 
counsellor, 
for it is only concerned 
for its own interests 
and 
not what is really best for you.  What this group elemental 
called egoism does is to create strong good or strong bad 
emotional vibrations 
in us.  So our Spirit Soul Ray is the 
inner part of our personality 
and the other part is all the 
elementals 
as thoughts 
and emotions 
cloaking 
that Spirit 
140 

R
ay
. 
It is in the 
personality that our strengths 
and 
we
aknesses, our virtues and vices get mixed 
up. 
Now, during Introspection we may find a simple 
undesirable elemental we wish to get rid of.  Or we may 
find  an overgrown swamp of elementals that are causing 
weaknesses and vices in us.  First we have to understand 
them and determine their strength. But you will lose if you 
try fighting that elemental or try to force change. Because 
even  thinking  about getting rid of an elemental gives it 
strength. Repeatedly thinking about it gives is much, much 
more strength. Always our attention, positive or negative 
gives to the elemental, gives it power and life. 
For example some  people have a smoking habit and 
they want to stop it.  So they  fight the urge to smoke, 
which is exerted by the elemental of smoking. They try 
suppressing their desire to smoke. Maybe they are 
successful for a week, a month or so.  Then they start 
smoking again. As we say all the time never fight or 
oppose an elemental. So how do we get rid of undesirable 
elementals? We must de-energize it, by convincing our self 
that we no longer care about it.  We must stop thinking 
about it in any way, for or against the elemental. 
141 

When Daskalos was young during World War II he 
was an officer. During this time for some years he was 
smoking. He decided to stop smoking but did not fight to 
suppress the urge. This is how he did it.  He took a 
cigarette said to it, "What are you, that I should be enslaved 
to you? You are nothing." He crushed it in the palm of his 
hand. He said there was no chance of him starting 
smoking again because he was no longer interested in it. 
When we de-energize an elemental in this way, it loses its 
power over us and goes away. But if you just start to think 
about it again you will pull it back to you and the habit can 
re-form. Maybe you are not a smoker but this method 
works to get rid of any weakness or bad habit. 
We have three steps for the elimination of 
undesirable elemental. Step one is the hardest and often 
the longest and that is to come to a full and un-conflicted 
decision to rid your personality of the unwanted elementals. 
This could be certain behaviours, certain thoughts or 
feelings. Let's say you want to stop an unwanted habit and 
decide to do so.  But you vacillate. You refrain from the 
habit sometimes but sometimes are pulled to engage in that 
habit. That means you have not really achieved step one. 
If you struggle in your mind pushing it away sometimes 
142 

and then sometimes still considering it; that also means you 
have not fully achieved the first step. But once your truly 
accomplish the first step the next two are not so hard. 
Step two is to convince yourself you do not want 
this weakness any longer and you are completely 
uninterested it.  You can use the power of the Sub­
Consciousness to complete this step by programming this 
command into your  mind by autosuggestion. The final 
step to ensure it does  not  return is to replace that unwanted 
habit,  thought or feeling with something positive you are 
sincerely interested in. 
Many people fail to implement this last step, and the 
habit returns. You do not want to leave your personality, 
your house open and unguarded like in Christ parable 
about the unclean Spirit. Leaving the house open and 
unguarded means  the elemental has a place to  re-enter. So 
fill that place  with something good and desirable and put a 
strong guard at the door. The guard is your alertness. 
I will say it again. The three steps to the elimination 
o
f any 
undesirable 
elemental 
are: 
1. 
Get an un-conflicted decision to eliminated it 
2. 
Dis-interest in it or devaluing it 
3. 
Replacement of it 
143 

Often 
people 
fail 
at the 
third 
step. 
If you 
de­
energize 
an elemental 
and 
do not 
replace 
it with 
something 
more 
constructive 
and 
life 
affirming, 
it is very 
easy 
for 
the 
elemental 
to return 
and 
resume 
its expression. 
So when 
we 
find 
some 
weakness 
we 
want 
to be free 
of we 
start 
by Introspection 
and 
using 
reason 
to ask 
our 
self 
some 
questions 
like: 
What 
is this 
weakness 
really 
giving 
me? 
Why 
should 
I continue 
it? 
What 
will 
be the 
outcome 
if I do continue 
it? 
This 
means 
we 
use 
the 
Mind 
as reason 
to come 
to the 
un-conflicted 
decision 
as to what 
to do. 
Following 
this 
line 
of investigation 
in our 
Introspection 
what 
do we 
find 
out? 
We 
all will 
find 
that 
we 
have been engaging 
our 
mind 
to serve 
our 
emotions 
chasing 
after 
desires. 
If the 
desire 
cannot 
be fulfilled 
now, 
it troubles 
us and 
we 
suffer. 
Disturbing 
thoughts 
can 
come 
like: 
Why 
can 
others 
have 
what 
I want 
but 
I cannot? 
Even 
if the 
desire 
is fulfilled, 
before 
long 
we don't 
care 
about 
that 
ardent 
desire 
and 
we 
start 
desiring 
something 
else. 
After 
that 
desire 
is fulfilled, 
then 
a new 
one 
comes 
forward, 
then 
another 
and 
another. 
There 
is literally 
no 
end 
in 
desiring. 
But 
our 
aim 
is not 
to put 
an end 
to desire. 
Our 
aim 
is to check 
our 
desires 
with 
reason. 
Are 
they 
really 
helpful 
to us; are 
they 
really 
necessary 
for 
our 
life? 
The 
144 

immediate benefit this way of using our mind to check our 
desires is the purification of the heart. "Blessed are the 
p
ure in heart for they shall see God." 
Our egoism is the entire collection of our elementals, 
which are sometimes very clever. When you, the real you, 
is able to clearly see your personal egoism, the egoism 
knows it and tries one of its very best tricks. That trick is 
to double. Now the very  same egoism that leads you 
astray, once detected will split in two without you noticing. 
So while you are analysing how the egoism has gone wrong 
and caused problems, the other part of it will  approach you 
from behind to deceive you  and  say something like: "Yes 
you  are right, your behaviour was  very  bad, you were so 
wrong." It will suggest so many other things. This causes 
an unhealthy reaction in you and you start to feel bad and 
guilty for the very things  that your egoism urged you to do. 
So it tries to hide in you by tangling your  sense of self with 
it.  If you start to feel  guilt and  shame over something you 
have done, know  that  you  have bought in to the 
masochistic side of egoism. We have to be very careful 
be
cause egoism 
is more dangerous than the 
Fallen 
Ones. 
Neither God, or your Guardian Angel or your real 
Self will ever, ever do anything to instil guilt in your 
145 

personality. 
That 
is the egoism's 
job. 
Instead 
the error 
of 
your ways 
is reflected 
to you in a wise, 
strong 
but loving 
way that shows 
you how you could 
have 
done 
better; 
However, 
if you ignore 
that and continue 
on and go too 
far, you could 
get the sting 
of consciousness, 
which 
is quite 
painful. 
But if you receive 
this sting, 
know 
that it is not 
done 
as punishment, 
but is given 
as a wakeup 
call, to 
awaken 
you to a serious mistake. 
This experience 
is 
definitely 
not a rebuke 
from 
your 
Guardian. 
Maybe 
we 
could 
call the sting 
of consciousness 
disapproval 
your 
bad 
behavior 
by your Guardian 
Angel 
who loves 
you. 
He loves 
you unconditionally 
but he is not required 
to love your 
wrong 
behaviors. 
So our most 
dangerous 
elementals 
are the ones 
that 
have 
been 
influenced 
and empowered 
by the so-called 
evil 
ones. 
These 
are the ones 
that torture 
us the most 
and 
cause 
the most 
damage 
to the personality. 
These 
include, 
but are not limited 
to enmiry, 
jealousy, 
anger, 
hating, 
and 
the urge to argue, 
fight 
and even 
kill.  How 
many 
people 
on 
Earth 
have allowed 
the escalation 
of his or her 
anger 
to 
reach 
the point 
of killing 
someone? 
The urge to kill is in 
the seventh 
veil, the worst 
shroud 
wrapping 
a Fallen One. 
As there 
are many, 
many 
Archangels 
there 
are many
, 
146 

many Arch Demons. But they come and go just like 
h
uman beings are born and pass over. Why? What else 
could it be but part of the Divine Plan for redemption. 
Most  people do not know about these things. But Saint 
Paul knew about them and wrote about the "Restoration of 
Everything". 
Just think it through. If Demons exist not as 
temporary shadows, but as evil  beings where would they 
exist? Since God is Omnipresent, equally  present 
e\'erywhere, evil beings would have to exist in God, since 
there is no place  outside of God. If evil was in  God then 
God could not be the Total Goodness. But God is the 
Total Goodness and Total  Love.   This means what is bad 
and  evil is a temporary phenomenon and not an ultimate 
reality in  God. 
Human beings can be influenced by evil ones. But 
even the worst, nastiest Arch  Demon  cannot influence an 
innocent person with a pure heart. So a pure heart is the 
very best protection from evil influences coming from 
humans or demons. That is what the practices of the 
re
sea
rchers of truth do - they purify your 
heart. 
Again
,  the 
extent of actiYity of the Fallen Ones 
is in 
t
h
eir 
ability to co vibrate and strengthe
n our 
own 
147 

destructive 
thoughts 
feelings 
and behaviors. 
They also 
can 
influence 
people 
to create very bad elementals, 
which 
when 
they reach a critical 
mass dominate 
a person 
to the point of 
possession. 
But it is only their own elementals 
that possess 
them and not a Fallen One.  We should 
learn about the 
nature of our own elementals. 
We should 
know how 
they 
were created 
and most importantly 
how to stop their 
undesirable 
influences 
in our personality. 
Now, how do you think the God of Love and Mercy 
should deal 
with these Fallen Ones and Arch Demons? 
Cast them into a lake of fire for all eternity 
to punish 
them 
for their transgressions? 
No.  That is in the imagination 
of 
humans 
and not in the Divine 
Plan.  What is, in the Divine 
Plan are unchanging 
universal 
laws.  One law governing 
all 
this is called the Law of Restoration 
and it governs 
everything. 
No matter how many veils they wrap themselves 
in, 
no matter how much of an evil influence 
they have created, 
at some point the Fallen Ones must return back home and 
be restored. 
This can take many, many centurie
s but it 
happens. 
Even the worst class of Arch Demon 
eventually 
becomes 
less and less active. 
It is like they lose their 
weigh
t 
148 

and begin to linger in less active conditions. Daskalos says 
they get sleepy and tired. 
We said the Shamels on one hand is connected to 
the Archangel of Light, Lucifer, and the other hand is 
extended to these Demons. So when one of them 
becomes less active and sleepy, a Shamel is attracting them 
like a magnet attracts a piece of metal.  Sleepily and blindly 
they are being drawn to the Shamel and they become even 
more inactive. 
This continues until there is a perfect attraction and 
then the Shamel opens a projection as hands, opens his 
chest and that sleeping Arch Demon enters inside the 
Shamel. Then the Shamel closes his arms across his chest 
and keeps it inside.  At which point the brilliance of the 
Shamel becomes dimmer and a kind of shadowy smoke 
comes out. But this dark smoke dissolves like mist in the 
morning sunlight. This is an eyewitness account from 
Daskalos who has seen this happen many times. 
If you want to see a somewhat similar Hollywood 
depictions of this watch the 1982 Steven Spielberg movie 
the "Dark Crystal".  At the end of the moYie there are 
seven Archetypal "Good beings" that start attracting se,·en 
Archetypal "Bad Beings" towards themselves and take 
149 

them in.  This is a somewhat similar to what the Shamels 
are doing. 
Now all of the Shamels belong to the same order 
and are of the same grade. But the demons they take in are 
of all seven grades, the seven veils of darkness. Some veils 
are thinner and more transparent. So the length of time a 
demon remains in a Shamel depends on the veils covering 
it. 
Then after a number of cenlu,ies the Shamel very 
slowly regains its original brilliance. At which point the 
Shamel opens and there is no more demon but what comes 
out is an Angel. This is the law of Restitution .... This is 
the mercy of God. 
Question 
Q. I understand that the Archangels and the Holy 
Spirit are maintaining the material body through the pattern 
of the Etheric Double. So, is the ether they are using in 
rebuilding & maintaining affected by our thoughts and 
actions? 
A. The Etheric Double is the mould in which and by 
which our bodies are built and maintained. This Etheric 
Double of our bodies is indestructible and therefore not 
effected by our thoughts, emotions or actions. Even the 
150 

amputation of a finger or a limb from the material body 
does not affect the Etheric Double in the least. 
However our thoughts and desires affect the 
distribution of etheric vitality to our material body through 
the Etheric Double. Uncontrolled desires, despondent 
thoughts,  outburst of anger and other unhealthy emotions 
burn vast quantities of our Etheric Vitally. This robs the 
Archangels of their portion of etheric vitality they need to 
keep our material body in good order. We all have noticed 
that when we are experiencing strong fear, anxiety, and 
especially anger it leaves us feeling weak  and drained. This 
is the proof. 
We have said many times that the etheric vitality has 
four main natures: the creative, which is not under our 
control but used by the Archangels for things like 
generating new tissue. We have the kinetic ether, which 
facilitates motion and movement. We have imprinting 
eith
er, which makes 
sight possible and along with 
kinetic 
et
her, which makes memory possible.  Then we have 
the 
aesthetic ether,  which  gives us the sense of feeling pleasure 
and pain. That is what anaesthetics are all about; they 
pr
event us from feeling pain or pleasure. 
151 

Daskalos was able, by remo\"ing the aesthetic ether 
from a patient and create an anaesthetic state in his or her 
body. One time when he was seventeen he was teaching 
his students about how the ether worked. In the audience 
were two doctors from the local hospital who were 
sceptical. So to prove what he was saying Daskalos 
removed the aesthetic ether from his own ann and then 
stuck a large hatpin into his arm without any pain or 
bleeding. The doctors were surprised but not totally 
convinced until he did the same to one of them. Then they 
were both so convinced that they invited him to help them 
in their surgeries at the hospital. So Daskalos the teenager 
went to work alongside the medical doctors in the surgery 
room, not just to remove pain but also to assist using his 
own methods. 
Q. Is suicide caused by Karma? 
A. What is karma? Karma means what you sow is 
what you are going to reap. It is the law of cause and effect. 
So Karma is the good or bad consequences we reap from 
our thoughts, feelings and actions. If we sow a massive 
amount of suicidal feelings and thoughts, these return to 
us. Repeat this over time and a very powerful self­
destructive group elemental is created. All elementals come 
152 

b
ack 
to their creator. 
So in this case the group 
elemental 
ex
erts a force on 
the person to destroy 
themselves.  But 
there is always a place in us that can say no to destructi,·c 
forces and choose another destiny. 
There was a case back in 1980 where a fellow was 
considering suicide.  The more he thought about it the 
more of a real that option became for him.  Soon he was 
thinking about it a lot and started to make a plan to really 
commit suicide.  What he was really doing was creating and 
empowering self-destructive elementals of suicide. 
Fortunately a family member found out and brought him 
to our teacher, who tried to help him come out of his 
confusion and see that suicide was not the answer.  Slowly 
he realized this was a very bad idea and made a decision not 
to  commit suicide.  He became more balance mentally and 
emotionally and felt much happier. Then one day he 
slipped and fell in the shower and was hurt very badly.  So 
in this case, even though he had abandoned the idea of 
killing himself, weakened the destructive elementals of 
suicide they he had created, they were still working and 
caused this ''accident". 
Q. Regarding the archangelic orders I wonder if you 
have had insights regarding the following: In the 
153

God

If we have 
a glass 
prism 
and we pass pure white 
light 
from 
the sun through 
it, seven 
different 
colors 
emerge 
from 
the other 
site. 
These colors 
are called 
the Spectrum 
of Light. 
Spectrum 
comes 
from 
the Latin 
and it literally 
means:  appearance. 
So the prism 
does 
not create 
the 
different colors 
of Light 
it just causes 
them 
to appear. 
These 
colors 
were 
always present 
in the white 
light but 
undifferentiated. 
Similarly 
the eternal 
Spirit 
Beings 
were 
always 
present 
in Absolute  Beingness 
but undifferentiated. 
The 
prism 
of God's 
Will Pleasure 
does 
not create 
them 
but 
causes 
them 
to appear. 
Of course, 
it is also the Will and 
Pleasure 
of these being 
to pass 
through 
this prism and 
become 
classified. 
But they do not have 
to do this; they 
do it by their 
own 
Free 
Will. 
However, 
we also know 
that some 
Spirit 
Beings 
r
eje
ct this Will 
Pleasure 
of God 
and willfully 
refuse to 
pass 
t
hr
ough the 
prism 
to become 
classified. 
They 
have the 
free 
w

coop

cooperate

Fallen Angels. They wrap themselves in various veils of 
darkness and descend as far as the ethereal world of the 
planet. 

Meditation 
Breathe 
deeply and concentrate in your 
chest area. 
S
ee a 
luminous rosy sun radiating there.  This 
is your 
etheric heart and, at the same time, your Psychical hean. 
Clearly see the Logoic light of love spread out from your 
chest, from your hean center. See it as a soft pale rosy sun 
radiating from your hean. 
Now see the small rosy white ball expands from 
your hean center. As the small radiant rosy ball scans to 
expand it grows bigger and bigger and then it depans from 
your body.  Then immediately another small one appears in 
the hean center and grows and grows, and also depans 
your body; then another one and another one. 
See these rosy spheres of light grow bigger and then 
depan from your material body. 
Where are they going is not imponant; thev only fill 
the space around you in a lovely pale rosy light.  See the 
pale rosy light from your hean all around your body.  These 
balls of light continuously keep  forming, expanding and 
le
a\·ing the chest. 
As each 
ball gets bigger than the chest it 
leaves 
and 
a
n
other one 
begins to grow, and on and 
on 
and 
on. 
157 

They all appear and grow rhythmically, harmoniously 
and beautifully. Breathe deeply, and make a wish that 
Logoic Love will always radiate from your heart center. 
In our next lesson we are going sketch God from its 
un-manifested state, which is beyond any name or form, 
through its manifestation as the Trinity in Beingness and 
on into Existence. And we will see how in the ancient 
cultures the name of God was passed from Lemuria, 
Atlantis, Egypt though to Biblical Palesliuc. 

Chapter 6 
THE FORMLESS ONE 
How can we comprehend the formless one? How 
can we know God in an un-manifested state? How can we 
love that one which has not yet come into Beingness? We 
can certainly comprehend and love the formless one in all 
its forms expressed all around us, but for us to try and 
study this formless God, prior to its appearance as 
Absolute Beingness, which  means God in Manifestation, is 
like a scientist trying to srudy what the universe was like 
before its creation. It is just not possible for us to 
understand this un-manifested state. 
Daskalos most often delivered the public lessons 
starting first with an expansive description of  the Absolute 
Reality - God. Further, into the lessons he would narrow 
the focus down to  finely  runed, practical information 
concerning our life on the Earth. 
When he gave this lesson in Cyprus he announced, 
"Now, what I'll say is what  all those enlightened ones have 
found out  and what are  also my own experiences. I said, 
enlightened ones all through these past cenruries in all the 
countries of  the world have found always the same thing, 
the same Truth. The Old Egyptian hierophants found it 
159 

out, in China, Confucius and Lao Tse, then Buddha from 
India, and many; many others came to the same conclusion. 
The God-man, Joshua Immanuel the Christ, has stated the 
same Truth and proved it." 
"You won't find this information in any books," he 
continued seriously. "These things have been hidden from 
the public, but at this time it is permissible to reveal more." 
Daskalos occasionally hovered on the edge of what 
was "permissible" to disclose to his listeners. On some 
occasions, it seemed he would slightly step over that edge 
and quickly terminate his line of thought with the familiar 
statement, "I am not allowed to reveal more."  Even when 
he said that, I had the feeling that as a personality he did 
want to tell us more, but was obedient to the higher 
intelligences who asked him not to. 
What he did reveal, however, was some of the most 
advanced teachings on the God, man and the nature of 
reality that has ever been giving before. He explained that 
prior to the creation of all  the existing forms of life, God is, 
was and will always be manifesting as Beingness. But even 
before 
its manifestation as Beingness, which is to say the 
Logos and the Holy Spirit; God is, was and will always be 
in the un-manifested state called Be-ness. 
160 

We 
can see 
thousands 
of years ago in the ancient 
l
an
gua
ge of Aramaic 
and also in the Hebrew, God 
in its 
st
ate as 
Be-ness was called "Al" or "El" and 
God in its 
sta
te 
of Beingness was called "Elohim" which in Hebrew 
meant "God in Plurality." Not too many people know this, 
but in Atlantis and Lemuria, they also called God as the 
state of Be-ness: "Al."  They called God as its state of 
Beingness "Al-la."  In the Biblical Aramaic language Christ 
was calling God in its state of Be-ness "Al."  He was 
calling God in its state of Beingness: "Alaha." 
The Absolute Reality's un-manifested state of Be­
ness is not understandable. But the two important states 
of reality that are understandable are Beingness and 
Existence. Beingness is of the Eternal Now.  It is 
completely outside of the concept of time -no past, no 
future, just now. The condition of Beingness was never 
born and thus will never pass away.  The condition of 
Existence on the other hand does have a beginning and an 
end.  For example, our material body is a living Existence. 
It had a beginning and definitely will come to an end one 
day.  Whereas in the condition of Beingness is Life 
ev
erlasting. 
161 

This primal state of Be-ness is the original source of 
all that is, or ever was, or ever could manifest or exist.  The 
nature of Be-ness is in its Absolute Self-Sufficiency. It 
lacks nothing, nothing can be added to it and nothing can 
be taken away from its self-sufficient nature. This 
Absolute Infinite Reality is God the father, the author of 
Life.  The Self-Sufficiency of God is the foundation of the 
so-called first cause, which is both God's will and pleasure 
to manifest itself - but where does it manifest? 
Since 
God is omnipresent it can only manifest itself within itself 
Now the Absolute Be-ness, the un-manifested God 
in its manifestation causes the appearance of the Trinity. 
To the Christians this is God the Father, God the Son and 
the Holy Spirit. To the Hindus this threefold expression of 
the Godhead is the Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. 
To the ancient Egyptians this Trinity of manifestation was 
Ra, Osiris and Isis.  So the Trinity is not just a Christian 
idea, it is the very nature of the manifestation of the 
supreme reality we call God. 
It may not be easy at first, but is important to 
understand this distinction between the Be-ness and the 
Beingness. It is one God in a new expression as Absolute 
Beingness, which is God the Father, The Logos (Son) and 
162 

the Holy Spirit. This does not mean now we have three 
Gods in this new expression as the Trinity. It is the one 
God now appearing in these three expressions. 
Now, in manifestation as the Absolute Infinite 
Beingness, we can become aware that what we call God is 
composed of an innumerable number of Eternal Spirit 
Beings similar to God. That is why we and the great early 
Christian Bishop  Origen call God Absolute Infinite 
Beingness. All of these Spirit Beings are in their Absolute 
Self-Awareness. They have their own Selfhood, which can 
be defined as an "awareness of being." 
These Beings also have the Total Wisdom, Total 
Power and Total Love, similar to God. They are similar to 
God and each other  but  there are subtle nuances between 
these beings. We rnight think of these Beings in God like 
individual cells that compose the body of God. Yet God is 
more than  just  the sum total of these Beings. In a similar 
w
ay the cells 
in our body 
together 
they 
make 
up 
our 
material body, but each cell has its own individual work; 
and yet we are much more than just the sum total of each 
c
ell in our body. 
When God's Will-Pleasure to manifest is expressed, 
this vibration  resonates within all these individual Beings as 
163 

their own Will-Pleasure to manifest themselves and in the 
very same instant, which is eternal; this Will-Pleasure causes 
an emanation from God and from all the Spirit Beings into 
what we call the formless Super-Substance of Mind.  This 
i';!ind can best be understood as the means used by God 
and the Spirit Beings to bring forth all of creation. 
Certain beings in the higher orders of the 
Principalities and Authorities co-vibrate with God's will to 
manifest and so they begin to get their various 
classifications. According to the Divine Plan and the work 
they will do in creation, they become classified into the 
various archangelic Orders. Nobody knows for sure how 
many archangelic Orders there are.  Some say twelve but 
nothing is really known about the three highest orders. 
Many have described something about the next two orders 
but again not much can be known about these.  However 
we do know something about the seven Archangels of the 
elements, of which, the Michaels, Gabriels, Raphaels, are 
the easiest to approach and so these interest us the most. 
The elements are definite degrees of vibrations of 
the Mind -The Mind Super-Substance. All the universes 
and everything in them are created by the means of the 
Mind Super-Substance. Now we detect Mind in    the 
164 

om
nip
resence 
of God. 
The Mind 
is un-ma
nifested 
in the 
Ab
solute 
Be-
ness. 
But in Absolute 
Beingne
ss, God 
and all 
th
e 
Infinite  Beings emanate the Mind directly. 
Once these Beings are classified into the various 
archangelic Orders, each order has its own work to do in 
co-creation with God. The archangelic Orders cooperate 
with each other in the creation; in the creation of all the 
Worlds of Existence.  Now we have identified the three 
distinct states of Reality: Be-ness, Beingness and Existence. 
Be-ness and Beingness are an everlasting state, but 
Existence is conditional and governed by the law of duality; 
thus it and everything in it has a beginning and an end. 
Everything in all the different Worlds Existences is dual. 
For example, we are in the Words of Existence and so we 
are dual - dual in one. On one side is our everlasting, 
Divine Nature, our Spirit-Soul-Self. On the other side we 
have our constantly changing human nature, our 
personality self. The Worlds of Existence are always under 
the law of duality and the law of change. 
Everything is living; the mineral kingdom, the plant 
kingdom, the animal kingdom and of course the human 
kingdom are all living in these Worlds of Existence. This is 
the life in the material, ethereal,  Psychical and Noetical 
165 

World. All this kind of life is what we call the phenomena 
of life, because they are temporarily living expressions of 
Life. But Life itself, the Everlasting Life is God as the 
formless Be-ness and the manifested Beingness. The Life 
is also our Divine Nature as a Spirit Soul. 
In the Words of Existences there are multitudes of 
different expressions of life. It is not possible to know 
them all.  Even the most advanced scientist does not know 
where all that life comes from and where it goes. Yet, for a 
time, we can all see that life appears and disappears in the 
bodies of all the life forms around us.  As personalities we 
understand that motion is a prime characteristic of living 
forms. We cannot really understand something living 
unless it has motion, movement or vibration? The sap is 
moving in the body of a tree, it spreads out it in the 
branches to create leaves, flowers and fruit. In the animals, 
their bodies are growing and the blood is circulating. They 
are born, develop and mature; then they grow old and 
eventually their material body dies. Then life of that body 
disappears from our view leaving an inanimate corpse and 
we say that thing died. 
In another lesson we spoke about what happens to 
the life of the nature Spirit of an animal when it passes 
166 

o
ve
r. 
But 
always 
in the life of a plant, 
an 
anima
l or a 
h
u
m
an, 
there is 
constant 
change. 
All this life 
enters 
this 
w
o
rld, 
exists 
for a time 
in a material 
body 
and 
then upon 
reaching the end of its material Circle of Possibilities, it 
then surrenders its life form in  order to make room  for 
other forms of  life. We  see this in a giant oak tree in a 
forest that maybe lives for 400 years, grows to massive size 
and then dies and falls to the ground. It gives up its 
material body to enrich the soil for other forms of life to 
use. This is one of the greatest mysteries: life gives its place 
in this  world to other life! 
So we are studying rwo things now, life and The 
Life. It is not hard  to study life; it is all around us in such a 
rich diversity that it is not possible to know all the varieties 
that exist. Scientist  state that, of the estimated five to  100 
million unique species existing on Earth today, only rwo 
million have been identified. These rwo million different 
species have an immeasurable number of members in all 
those species. But did you know that 97 percent of all the 
life  forms that  ever lived on Earth are now extinct? Just 
t
hi
nk of the 
inexhaustibility of life - life 
even as 
p
he
nom
ena. 
167 

But we must try to also understand The Life, the 
e,·erlasting Life. No human can fully comprehend The 
Life. But when a human being reaches the point of 
realizing their Sprit -Soul Self, then their mortal self will 
know 
what The Life is.  Because then they will understand 
that as a Spirit-Soul, they are The Life. And that Life 
expresses itself in a countless array of life forms - the 
phenomena of life.  So in order to understand each better, 
it takes the comparison to analyze both: The Lite and the 
phenomena of life. 
Now at a theoretical level you may understand that 
you have a Divine Nature, expressing itself with the human 
nature in a material body. But then look at the animals they 
have a material body; so do they too have a Divine 
counterpart' Do animals have a Soul? No animal has a 
Soul. Humans are made in the image and likenesses of 
God; the animals are not made in the image and likeness of 
God. They are Divine Holy Spiritual expressions, but they 
do not have a self that can use the Mind to create as we do. 
Furthermore as human beings we have the means of 
understanding who we are, again by using the Mind. This 
means we are self-conscious, and can use the Mind self­
consciously. No animal has or ever will be able to do that. 
168 

They are limited to using the lvlind as instinct - the instinct 
of  being that kind of animal. So the animals have a 
consciousness, an instinctive consciousness, which is 
co
m
ple
tely 
different to the human self-co
nsciou
sness. 
Animals do not have a Soul but they do have a 
Divine counterpart,  which is coming from the Angels and 
Archangels who created them. What about the plants? 
The plants are also expressing a life, behind which are the 
Archangel and the Angels. To a degree, these correspond 
to our Divine Nature. But this duality is not joined as it is 
in man. In the case of the animals, the higher Divine 
emissaries in them are always ruling over the lower nature 
of the animal. So the animal kingdom is in harmony with 
itself and its environment. Human beings are the only 
creation that can and does go out of harmony with 
themselves, others around them and their own 
environment. Why do you think that is? 
God as Be-ness and as Beingness has its multiplicity 
in its One-ness. Multiplicity does not mean God is 
multiplying. Multiplicity means "being in great numbers." 
So God has in its oneness a plurality a multiplicity of 
Eternal Spirit Beings infinite in number. Those are the 
billions,  upon  billions Archangels who have not 
169 

disconnected themselves from the One-ness of their 
Source. 
As we said, these Beings are similar to God. They 
are similar but not identical. Even Christ, feeling he was 
the Son of God, said that God the Father was greater than 
himself. So what is the difference between these Holy 
Archangels and God? The difference is simply in the way 
the express themselves; each order has its own work within 
God. So this is the plurality, within the One-ness of God. 
Since we are made in the image of God, we have our 
own plurality in our one-ness too. For example, our 
oneness can be seen as our personality and it has its own 
plurality, which we ourselves create. These creations are 
part of our personality but when we de-energize these 
creations our self withdraws from them. These creations 
are of course our emotion and thought forms, our own 
elementals. It is the plurality of these elementals that 
compose the one-ness of our personality self. 
A metaphor of the plurality of God (as Absolutely 
Beingness) could be seen in a comparison with the ocean. 
If we consider God to be like the ocean, then all the 
phenomena of life are like drops in that ocean that is seen 
symbolically as The Life. Life is everything and there is no 
170 

p
art of the universes that does not have life.  Ukewise there 
is n
o part in Existence that is not the Absolute Beingness. 
This is the Omnipresence of God.  Absolute Beingness is 
Life and so we see life in all parts of Absolute Beingness -
God. These parts we are calling the phenomena of life and 
they can be found at different dimensions but always they 
exis
t in a 
form. We all see the phenomena of life 
on Earth 
in the plants, animals and trees.  But many more 
phenomena of life exist in the higher planes of reality that 
are invisible to us now.  They exist in all the Psychical 
Worlds and up to the lower Noetical World. These are 
worlds of living forms too, but pay attention, it is not the 
form that is bring forth the phenomena of life, it  is Life 
itself that brings forth various forms of life.  All the 
p
henomena of life are expressing energy and movement in 
a form. 
All life forms are expressions of Archetypal Ideas, 
which are in the Divine meditation of the Absolute Be­
ness.  The material human body is one of those life forms. 
Seven billion people live on Earth now, and the bodies of 
these people all have the same composition. All these 
bodies have movement in the muscular system, the 
circulatory system and in the nervous system. The o
rg
ans 
171 

in our body all have very harmonious  movement serving an 
important purpose. We see it in the circulation of the 
blood, the movement of the air in and out of the lungs. 
There is an advanced meditation called Divine 
Symphony where Daskalos relays a teaching from an 
Archangel on this subject. In this meditation, the 
Archangel speaks of how beautiful it is to see the 
harmonious movements of our breathing, the beating of 
our heart and the circulation of our bluuJ. It is not 
possible to conceive of beauty without harmony. 
So we have harmony and movement our human 
body. The form of the human body is in the Archetypal 
Idea - the Idea of Man, which is symbolized by the five 
pointed star. Our body is under the care of the Holy Spirit 
and it has a life of its own. But also we see another 
expression in the material body and this is the personality. 
As we said before; our personality is a composition of all 
the elementals we harbor and express. 
You will find that in studying the nature of your own 
elementals, and others, you will discover that 80% of them 
are created with mostly emotions as feelings and desires. 
They can receive so much energy from a person that they 
gain 
enough strength to crush their personality. These 
172 

kin
ds are called, phobias, fixed ideas and obsessive­
compulsive disorders. Psychiatrists and drug manufactures 
gi
ve these afflictions names without knowing their nature 
or how to really deal with them. In today's world, 
pharmaceutical companies identify an  ever-expanding 
number of disorders. While in their commercials, they 
offer and ever expanding number of drugs to treat but not 
cure the disorders they identify. 
Unfortunately too many of the elementals created 
are the human in nature  demons that are destructive, 
misleading or illusionary. Maybe only 20% of all the 
created elementals are the human in nature angels. This is 
because most of the elementals are created out of human 
weaknesses as desires and attachments. 
This is the reason behind Buddha's Nobel Truths. 
The first  noble  truth was that life is suffering. The second 
noble  truth was that the cause of our suffering is our own 
attachments. The truth of that statement can be seen in 
our own life. Our own personal attachments are to our 
str
ongest desires. 
Our attachments are 
enslaving 
us to 
desires 
for 
property, 
money, 
people, 
places 
and 
thing
s, 
whic
h 
tends to 
cause
s suffering 
- sooner 
or 
later. 
W
e suffer 
if 
we 
don't 
get 
the 
things 
we 
are 
ve
ry attach
ed 
to
. 
W
e 
173 

suffer 
if we get things 
that we are ver
y 
attached 
to not 
getting. 
And even if you get all the objects 
of your desire, 
you will still end up suffering 
to some degree. 
Because 
all 
those desire 
objects belong 
to the constantly 
changing 
Worlds 
of Existence 
and so in time, they too will pass 
away. 
So the enlightened 
Buddha 
rightly 
gave the top 
priority 
to detachment 
as a means 
of reducing 
our 
suffering. 
Now the elementals 
work in two distinct 
ways. 
Regardless 
of an elemental's 
normal 
size, it starts about 
the 
size of a grain of course 
salt.  It gets projected 
out of a man 
or woman 
from the area of the third eye, and then gets its 
normal 
size, does it work, and 
then returns 
back to the one 
who projected 
it.  Now, it again returns 
to the size of a 
grain of salt and re-enters 
that person, 
bringing 
along seven 
other elementals 
similar 
to its nature. 
This reveals 
that we 
are infected 
and influenced 
by the elementals 
we create 
and 
project. 
But it also means 
we can be infected 
and 
influenced 
by elementals 
of a similar 
nature 
as our own 
elementals 
that come from the environment 
around 
us. 
One way elementals 
can influence 
us is directly. 
Directly 
means 
the elemental 
can stimulate 
us to think and 
take direct action 
on how to accomplish 
the specific 
desire 
174 

of the elemental. The second way they can influence us is 
indirectly. Indirectly they command power and can bring 
about circumstance that  will deliver our desire - if you 
le
ave 
them alone to do  their work. Sooner or 
later all 
desires incline to be fulfilled. 
You hear this all the time and may have noticed it 
yourself; that when someone has a very strong desire for 
something and broods over it  for months and months it 
seldom  comes to them. But when you have forgotten 
about the object of your desire, became interested in 
something else, then the desire tends to be  fulfilled. So 
therein  rests the secret for success. 
People have the feeling that when they stop wanting 
something, it is then that it comes to them. That is  true 
because "stop wanting" means they leave the elemental 
time to do its  work. But if you keep on thinking about and 
desiring it you pull that elemental back to you over and 
over by remembering it  again. So to be  successful you 
must stop thinking about your elemental once you have 
created it, so it  will  have  time to accomplish its work. 
Remember an elemental can liYe much longer than a 
person's lifetime. We create so many desire type elementals 
that it is not possible to fulfill them all in a single lifetime. 
175 

So over the course of lifetimes we can see that many such 
elementals created in past lifetimes are being fulfilled in 
future lifetimes. 
Now here is the real problem with that process. 
When you start to consciously develop  yourself spiritually, 
you may no longer be interested in your desires from 
previous lifetimes. You may outgrow certain old desires as 
you unfold spiritually. Moreover, the strongest unfulfilled 
desire of a previous lifetime may well be the strongest 
obstacle to your Spiritual progress in your current lifetime. 
You may rightly think that you would be far better off 
without this desire in this lifetime. But it was you who 
created that strong desire in the past. This is one of the 
most common reasons why people are, rich, poor, healthy, 
unhealthy, happy or unhappy in their current lifetime. It is 
a direct  outcome the elementals that comprised their 
personality in past and current incarnations. 
We have talked about incarnation, de-incarnation 
and reincarnation -but who is it that gets re-incarnated. Is 
it your personality that is reincarnating? For example, if 
you were named John in a past incarnation and in the next 
incarnation you are born in a different country with the 
name Marco. Does that mean John re-incarnated as 
176 

Marco? Is your personality from this incarnation, going to 
incarnate again in a different counttT, under difference 
circumstances and be called a new name? In other words, 
is 
that new 
personality in a future lifetime 
the same 
p
ers
onality you are 
today? No it is not the 
personality that 
rein
carnates, it the Spirit Soul. 
However, if in this incarnation you can reach your 
Spirit-Soul in full Self-Realization, then yes those past 
incarnations are yours and future incarnations are yours. 
Incarnations are like chapters in a book. The first chapter 
in a book is not the second, the third or any other chapter 
in the book. Yet the book itself can say all the chapters are 
mine. In the same way we, as a Spirit-Soul, can rightly 
claim that all the incarnations are mine. But the personality 
in one lifetime cannot rightly claim to be another 
personality in a different  lifetime any more than one 
chapter in the book can claim to be any other chapter. So 
what happens to all our personalities from past lifetimes? 
Do they disappear? The have become like living holograms 
p
reserved forever in the Cosmic Consciousness. 
In the 
East there 
is a mistaken 
belief 
that 
a human 
can reincarnate as an animal and an animal can reincarnate 
as a human. This notion is wrong; for sure there is no 
177 

transmigration of a Soul between animals and humans. 
One reason is because there is a completely different 
course of development for humankind than there is for 
animals. So this is the main differences between our 
understandings and experiences of reincarnation compared 
to the popularized ideas about reincarnation. 
What then is the relationship between our past 
incarnations and our current incarnation? Karma!  Not in 
the absolute sense, because in each new lifetime we start 
with mostly a clean slate so that we are given a chance to 
put down past burdens and move forward more freely. 
However about 20% of our Karma is carried over from 
past lifetimes while the other 80%, we create in this 
lifetime. 
In any of your lifetimes there is part of your 
Selfhood that stands between your current personality and 
your Soul.  That in-between part is what we call the 
Permanent Personality, which is the Soul in expression in 
the Worlds of Existence. It brings forward the important 
lessons that have not been learned in past incarnations. So 
what we are calling Karma is not a punishment; Karma is a 
means of learning, knowing and advancing spiritually. 
178 

The 
reality 
is that we lived 
in past 
lifetim
es, we 
are 
li
vin
g 
now 
and we will live again 
in a future 
lifetim
e.  So 
wh
y 
do we 
not 
rememb
er the past ones? 
This 
is becaus
e 
o
ur 
p
erson
ality in this 
lifetime 
is so overly 
focused 
outside 
of itself most of the time. The personality is centered 
currently on its own cherished interests and so it forgets 
the past. This loss of past life memory is also the mercy of 
God, so as not to be burdened by remembering past 
mistakes and serious wrongs. This gives the current 
personality the freedom to concentrate on the road ahead 
in this current lifetime. We will start remembering past 
incarnations when that remembrance, good or bad, will not 
harm,  delay or distract us from our purpose in our current 
lifetime. That automatically happens when we place our 
personality in the loving hands of our Spirit-Soul Self. 
Then past memories will come flooding back in to us. So 
we must not blame the mercy of God for not remembering 
our past lifetimes. But just because you do not remember 
p
ast lives does not mean you did not live  before. Just 
b
ecause 
you 
cannot 
remember 
what 
you had 
for dinner 
last 
Wedn
esday 
does 
not 
mean 
you did not eat 
last Wedn
esday. 
In order to remember, we have to unfold our 
personality into its Divine Nature. That is an  immense 
179 

gain. 
In this you 
will also 
gain 
powers.  Now 
as a 
personality 
you 
may 
feel weak, 
but as a Spirit-Soul 
you 
are a 
go<l. 
A god 
is powerful. 
Your 
gain 
is the real Self­
Consciousness; 
you become 
the master 
of your 
emotions, 
thoughts 
and life. 
Now 
you have 
reached 
a much 
higher 
vantage 
point 
above 
the personality's 
self-consciousness. 
So now, 
you might 
even 
laugh 
at how 
before 
you 
took 
the 
behaviors 
of your 
personality 
as so ver
y 
real. 
When 
Daskalos 
was 
a small 
child 
he made 
this 
statement 
to his father 
and he repeated it 
all his life. 
It was, 
"Nothing 
matters 
much, 
and most 
things 
do not matter 
at 
all." 
Daskalos 
said 
his father 
was 
not really 
able 
to 
comprehend 
his knowledge 
and abilities 
as a child. 
But he 
did seem 
to understand 
this statement 
and 
took 
it to heart. 
Now 
we all have 
to learn 
our lessons 
in life and 
there 
are two 
ways 
to do that. 
One 
way 
is by reason, 
to think 
before 
we act and then 
act with 
reason. 
The 
second 
way 
Daskalos called 
the whip 
of destiny, 
which 
is the hard 
and 
painful 
way. 
Both 
ways 
will eventually 
produce 
the same 
result. 
But how 
long 
it takes 
you and 
your 
experience 
along 
the way 
will be totally 
different 
depending 
on which 
way 
you choose 
to get your 
lesson. 
With 
the whip 
of 
destiny 
way, 
when 
you disturb 
the balance 
of the universal 
180 

l
a
w
s y
ou s
uffer 
when the laws are 
brought 
back 
into 
b
a
la
n
ce. 
But 
who is it 
that suffers? 
Is it your 
Spirit-Soul
? 
N
o, y
our 
Spirit-S
oul Self never 
suffers 
for the 
persona
lity's 
m
ist
akes. 
It is always 
your personality 
self that 
pays off 
the 
karmic debt by suffering. In the East they call this way 
Karma Yoga. But maybe we should call this way, Trial and 
Error Yoga for that is what it is.  Whatever you call it, 
definitely it is the longest and hardest way to progress in 
life. 
Again it is our own elementals that are driving this 
process. We said that once an elemental fulfills its purpose 
it gets de-energized and rerums to the Cosmic 
Consciousness. Or if we ourselves de-energize the 
elemental before it fulfills its purpose, it leaves and returns 
to the Cosmic Consciousness too. 
However if it is a serious elemental and we are 
unable to de-energize it,  then sometimes, but very seldom, 
your Guarding Angel will de-energize it for  you.  But in this 
c
ase if he does do it, then prepare yourself for a painful 
sting of consciousness. On rare occasions your Guardian 
Angel gives you a kind of slap to wake you up to a serious 
mistake you are committing. He does this out of love, so 
181 

you will not mindlessly keep repeating the same mistakes 
and keep reaping the same undesirable consequences time 
and time again. The other Archangels can interfere to 
some extent, but they will never force you to do or not do 
anything. 
Human beings can and should help each other and 
that is the work of a certain order of Researchers of Truth 
called the Invisible Helpers or Brothers of Mercy. These 
compassionate human beings are helping others regain 
their Divine inheritance. This is the reason all enlightened 
masters in the past have come and keep coming. 
Following their great guidance we can understand 
something of the Common Selfhood of human kind. At 
some point it begins to dawn on us that we are in everyone 
and everyone is in us.  If one person on Earth is suffering 
we all are suffering to a degree. Don't you feel a degree of 
suffering when you see man's inhumanity to man? When 
you see the human loss from natural disasters or when you 
see the pain, injuries and death caused by world conflicts 
on the TV news, doesn't a part of you suffer? This is a 
small 
indicator pointing to the Common Selfhood of us all. 
Being a cell in the Common Selfhood of humanity, 
we should never criticize others because everyone is us and

Now so much information has been given on the 
elementals, the good, the bad and the useless. You know 
the destructive ones in us and other people can cause much 
harm. But also harmful elementals can reside in places and 
cause trouble there too as we mentioned in a previous 
lesson. There are certain intersections in cities where there 
are way more accidents that other locations. Sometimes 
this can be from a poor design but still frightening 
elementals can become associated with these locations and 
continue to cause accidents. 
Also locations where violent crimes ha,·e been 
committed the elementals of the incident can stay there. 
What happens when someone passes through such a place? 
Do the destructive elementals attack everyone? No.  If 
y
ou 
are  a good  and loving person with a pure  heart you can 
safely pass through a massive group of destructive 
elementals and they will not even try to harm you. A 
clairvoyant will see them part and move awa
y 
as a good-
183 

hearted person passes through. 
Then later after the person 
is gone, they move right back into that 
place. 
However 
if you have similar vibrations 
as the 
destructive 
elementals 
or if you quarrel and have ill will and 
try passing through 
that area; then those very same 
elementals 
will attack you and can cause an accident. 
Why? 
This is because 
evil attacks evils.  Of course this is a main 
reason why Christ said: do not resist or fight evil.  And by 
complaining 
against others and fighting, 
you are also 
creating 
poison in your own body.  This poison, in the 
form of harmful 
elementals, 
becomes 
part of your 
personality. 
So if you have a loving heart and a pure mind, you 
never need to be concerned 
about any harmful 
elemental. 
But if you are vibrating 
in similar way as wicked elementals, 
your own wickedness 
is causing a punishment 
to come to 
you.  So in this way someone 
can be causing punishment 
to 
his or her self without 
even knowing 
it.  Now keep in mind 
never will God or any Archangel 
punish; Archangels 
do not 
even express anything 
negative 
they only know love. 
As we move through 
our daily environment 
we 
travel in a sea of good and bad elementals. 
So it is helpful 
to have a shield guarding 
us from negative 
elementals 
in the

Question 
Q. 
The teachings 
say we have 
three 
bodies, 
material 
Psychical 
and Noetical; 
so what 
are the etheric 
body 
and 
the Noetic 
body. 
A. The etheric 
counter 
part of our material 
body 
is 
our Etheric 
Double. 
It is not an independent 
body. 
If the 
Etheric 
Double 
leaves 
the material 
body 
the material 
body 
dies. The ethereal 
world 
is in between 
the material 
world 
and the Psychical Worlds 
and in a higher 
scale it is in 
between 
the Psychical 
and the Noetical 
World. 
And in a 
still higher 
state between 
the Noetical 
and Noetic 
body 
or 
more 
accurately 
the Noetic 
form, 
which 
is the archetype 
called 
the Human 
Idea and the Heavenly 
Man. 
When 
Christ 
called 
himself 
the Son of Man he was not referring 
to being 
the son of Joseph 
the carpenter. 
Since 
Christ 
was 
born 
immaculate, 
there 
was no Earthly 
father 
involved. 
But 
Christ 
was humanized, 
so the "Son 
of Man" 
comment 
was 
a reference 
to this Human 
Form 
or Human 
Idea archetype. 
Q. 
I read that the Noetic 
body 
also has its etheric 
counterpart 
body. 
Noetic 
is formless, 
right? 
Why? 
A. At the Noetic 
level it cannot 
be called 
a body 
as 
we think 
of the body. 
Because 
at this level, 
as you 
correctly 
186 

say it is formless, which again means it has definition but it 
is everywhere. Why  is it formless? It is formless because it 
is in the realm of Beingness and not in the Worlds of 
Existence where we first see the appearance of body-forms 
as we understand them now. Let me give you an  example 
Daskalos gave many times. In the worlds of Existence we 
can understand something that is white such as a bird, a 
dog, a cat. We can understand whiteness in this way 
because it exists in bodily forms. But in the Noetic State 
whiteness exists as a formless principle. Can you 
understand the principle of whiteness without any form? 
In the Noetic state you can experience and understand the 
principle of whiteness without any form. 
To come in contact with the human form we must 
first do the practical work necessary in order to reach this 
stag
e.  We do that 
by starting from the 
present-day­
p
ers
onality.  We should 
study our personality. 
Stud
yi
ng the 
personality we study the condition of ours so-called 
Psycho-Noetical body, because our personality is a product 
of the so-called elementals composing it, which are Psycho­
Noetical creatures. We create the elementals. The word 
creature means something that has been created. 
187 

This is one of the most important  branches of study. 
To turn with courage and to boldly face the current 
condition of our personality, it is only in this way that we 
can discover and face our problems properly. The 
problems of our times are leading personalities in to great 
confusions. These elementals drive people into emotional 
misery, mental illness and even to commit suicide. Why? 
Life is precious! We have to understand the value of life. 
But the emotional-mental notions and illusion we have 
allowed into us, into our Psycho-Noetical body are 
distorting and sometimes torturing us to a seemingly 
unbearable point.

Now 
you are

in your

Omnipresence is also in your bodies and also with your 
p

Whatever you ask God, He is ready to give you. He 
will  give us material  things and opportunities. But we will 
ask Him also to lead us, while being in temptation, and to 
deliver us from evil. 
Check and investigate the quality of your desires, of 
your emotions and of any of your weaknesses. Even if you 
think  you  have  the  right to dislike or hate others because 
they  have wronged you; it is still a poison in your bodies. 
Anger and  hatred are deadly poisons to the material body. 
For  the  sake of your personality and for the sake of the 
health of your bodies remove from your mind all negative 
elementals. Even common complaints about other must 
be removed. Because as the Buddha rightly observed; "At

Next week we will speak even more about the 
Absolute Be-Ness, the Absolute Infinite Beingness and 
those Holy Monadic beings which compose the Absolute 
Infinite Beingness. And we will look closer at the Holy 
Monadic Self, our eternal Spirit Being Self; and how as the 
source of our Selfhood it projects a brilliant luminous ray 
of Spirit that becomes humanized and incarnated into the 
worlds of Existence. 

Chapter 7 
GOD AND THE REALMS OF BEINGNESS 
Let's again review what we know and believe about 
God and the state called Beingness. But in order to do that 
we  first need to describe the three states of reality. The 
first state is really  beyond any description so we are not 
going to be able to talk  about that  state directly. Really, the 
less  said about that state the better. But we can use words 
to point to that original state of the un-manifested God. 
Before Its initial manifestation, God is completely 
unknowable,  beyond name, beyond form and unexpressed. 
In order to know anything about something we need 
something else to compare it to.  If we have a child who 
was  born  and raised in a place where there  was abundant 
light and only abundant light that child would not have 
experienced any darkness. If you asked him what darkness 
was? He could not reply. likewise if you asked him what is 
light? He could  not reply either because he had never 
known anything but the light. But take him to a place that 
is dark, and then ask him: "What is darkness, what is 
lig
ht"? Then that child would understand something 
about both. So it is through comparison that we 
u
nderstand. But at this level, God is infinite, absolute and 
191 

completely 
unlimited. 
What is unlimited 
is not 
comprehendible 
because 
it is completely 
beyond 
name and 
form. 
If something 
is comprehendible 
and intelligible 
then 
we can give it a name and describe 
it.  But what is 
completely 
unintelligible 
cannot 
be known 
or named. 
We refer to this unknowable 
God as the Absolute 
Be-ness. 
However, 
it is possible 
to detect 
something 
about 
this un-manifested 
primal 
state of God using an old Greek 
technique. 
The ancient 
Greeks 
had a sure fired method 
of 
determining 
the truth about 
unknown things. 
They called 
it logic. 
Aristotle 
claimed 
he invented 
it.  It works like 
this. 
You start with two known 
things 
to deduce 
the truth of a 
third unknown 
thing. 
Here is a simple 
example 
of how they used it:  From 
their direct 
experience 
they knew something 
about 
water 
and how it behaves 
and had observed 
that water leaks 
through 
openings 
and holes. 
They also noticed 
that their 
skin got wet from sweat in the hot Greek 
summers. 
Now 
from these two known 
things 
they used logic to deduct 
that 
for water to come from the inside 
of their body and form 
on the outside 
of their skin, their skin must have holes in it. 
In this way ancient 
Greeks reached 
the truth of this before 
192 

o
r
th
o
dox 
scienc
e was 
able 
to prove 
that 
skin 
indeed 
had 
h
o
les   in 
it that 
they 
called 
pores. 
Now 
we can 
employ 
this same 
method to 
deduct 
so
m
ethin
g of 
about 
the un-manifested 
God 
by 
observi
ng 
wh
at is 
detectable 
in God's 
manifestation
.  For 
example
, 
mystics who have been able to raise their consciousness 
high 
enough 
have 
detected 
that 
God 
in its manifestatio
n is 
composed of billions and  billions of Eternal  Spirit Beings. 
Because of this, we call God in its manifestation the 
Absolute Beingness. The Jewish mystics call this 
multiplicity of God - Elohim. By logical deduction we can 
say that for these  Eternal  Spirit Beings to be present in the 
Beingness they must have been in the Be-ness in some un­
manifested condition. Nothing in this world or any other 
world 
comes 
from 
nothing. 
Other religions observed this too. In Islam God, in 
its singular form God is called AL and Allah is God in 
manifestation. When speaking in the Aramaic language, 
Christ was calling God in Its singular form AL and Alaha 
for God in manifestation as Beingness. The term Al was 
also used for God by the ancient Egyptians and others. 
Likewise the Jews  were calling God in Its singular nature 
EL and  Elohim for God in manifestation as Beingness. 
193 

The 
literal 
meaning 
of Elohim 
is "God 
in plurality". 
God, 
Absolute 
Be-ness, 
is in an Absolute 
state 
of Self­
Sufficiency. 
This 
is a reality 
no 
human 
intelligence 
can 
comprehend. 
But 
one 
of the 
characteristics 
of God 
in 
manifestation 
that 
is somewhat 
comprehendible 
is this 
Multiplicity 
of Beings. 
Multiplicity 
does 
not 
mean 
God 
is 
multiplying 
more 
and 
more. 
Multiplicity 
means 
being 
in 
great 
numbers. 
Think 
of the 
multiplicity 
of Beings 
composing 
God 
like 
the 
individual 
cells 
composing 
your 
body. 
They 
are 
individual 
cells 
but 
are 
as one 
body. 
Each 
of us has 
a material 
body 
with 
an unimaginable 
number 
of individual 
cells. 
You 
can 
say 
all of these 
cells 
are 
you. 
Likewise 
each 
cell, 
could, 
could 
also 
claim 
to be 
you. 
But 
not 
all cells 
in your 
body 
are 
the 
same. 
Brain 
cells 
are 
not 
the 
same 
blood 
cells. 
An 
atom 
composing 
a blood 
cell 
is not 
the 
same 
as an atom 
that 
composes 
a brain 
cell, 
the 
cell 
of your 
heart 
or any 
other 
bodily 
organ. 
Yet 
they 
are 
all you, 
this 
is your 
own 
multiplicity. 
You 
may 
have 
heard 
that 
your 
body 
has 
a 
consciousness 
of its own, 
different 
from 
your 
consciousness 
as a personality. 
Likewise 
each 
cell 
of your 
body 
has 
its own 
consciousness. 
Yet, 
neither 
the 
body's 
194 

c
o
n
sc
io
usn
ess, 
nor the individual 
consc
iousness 
of the cells 
a
r
e 
sy
nc
hronized 
and coordinated 
with 
your 
consc
iousness 
as 
a 
p
ers
onality. 
So they function 
below 
your 
aware
ness. 
Si
m
ilar
ly your 
individu
alize self-conscio
usness 
is like 
a 
co
nsc
ious 
cell that exists in the Cosmic 
Consciou
sness of 
God. 
When you can attune and coordinate your 
personality with your Inner Self you will reach into that 
Cosmic Consciousness. In doing so,  you  will  raise your 
consciousness to the level of Self Super Consciousness. 
Today people believe they are conscious but it is just 
an embryonic state of consciousness they have.  People will 
understand this just as soon as they raise their 
consciousness to higher levels, to true Self Realization, 
which means Soul Self Awareness. Of course first we must 
purify the personality and break our miss-identification of 
Self 
with it. 
Now 
at the 
highest level 
all the Eternal 
Spirit 
Beings, 
as 
H
oly 
Monads are 
similar 
to one another and 
similar to 
Ab
solute 
Beingne
ss.  These absolute 
Self-
consci
ous, 
i
m
m
ortal 
beings have 
never been born and 
will never 
die. 
O
ur 
tr
ue self 
at this highest 
level of 
Selfhood 
is a 
Holy 
M
o
nad 
Being 
within 
t
h
e Absolute 
Beingn
ess
' 
m

195 

But rather 
than 
a state 
of Selfhood 
we should 
consider 
the 
Holy 
Monad 
as the ground 
of our Selfhood. 
To be clear, 
we are stating 
that 
there 
is only 
One 
God 
in Its multiplicity. 
Each 
and 
every 
human 
being 
originates 
within 
this 
multiplicity 
as an eternal 
Spirit 
Being. 
All of Humanity, 
the archangelic 
Orders 
- literally 
all Self­
aware 
Beings 
are Holy 
Monads 
within 
the one 
eternal 
God 
Where 
else 
could 
they 
be? 
As we said, 
we have 
the source 
of our Selfhood 
as a 
Holy 
Monad. 
At this level 
all the Holy 
Monads 
are similar 
to one 
another; 
they 
are all similar 
but with 
slight 
differences. 
Again, 
a Holy 
Monad 
is an entity 
within 
the 
Multiplicity 
of the Absolute 
Beingness. 
The 
Absolute 
Beingness 
has Its Multiplicity. 
A Holy 
Monad 
is an 
expression 
of this Multiplicity. 
That 
expression 
creates 
the 
Human 
Beings 
and 
archangelic 
Beings 
and 
yet it is only 
a 
small 
radiance 
of our Holy 
Monadic 
Self 
that 
gest 
expression 
as a Human 
Being. 
It is just one 
ray of our 
Spirit 
Being 
that 
gets 
projected 
through 
the Human 
Idea 
archetype 
to become 
humanized. 
As a Holy 
Monad, 
we 
may 
be Eternal 
Spirit 
Beings 
but we are not yet Human 
Beings. 
So when 
this minute 
ray of our Spirit 
is projected 
196 

th
ro
ug
h the 
Human 
Idea our Soul is 
formed. 
Now 
we 
h
a
ve 
become 
Human 
Beings
. 
T
he Holy 
Monad 
is not of time and place; 
it is in the 
et
ern
al realm 
of Beingness. 
Our Holy 
Monadic 
Self 
p
roj
ects 
not just one radiance 
but also many 
radiance
s. 
Some, not all, of these rays of Spirit, pass through this 
archetype to become humanized. Yet many humanized 
rays of Spirit can  belong to the same Holy Monad. Each 
Holy Monad does project thousands of Spirit Rays that are 
destined to become humanized. All the humanized rays 
that belong to the same  Holy Monad have an affinity for 
each other. So if you meet one of these humanized rays 
from the same Monad as yours, you feel a tremendous 
kinship with them that is beyond Earthly comprehension. 
This is really what is giving the experience of Twin 
Flames, which has sometimes been mistakenly called Twin 
Souls. Twin Soul is a misnomer because what we are 
talking about here is high above the formation of the Soul 
a
nd 
h
umaniz
ation. 
There 
are many 
that belong 
to the same 
Holy 
Monad 
and their 
radiances 
also pass 
throu
gh the 
Hu
m
an Idea 
to give self-awareness 
in 
Existen
ce a
s 
a man 
o
r 
a w
oman. 
This 
means 
that at this 
very 
momen
t 
some 
ra
dia
nces 
of your  Holy  Monad are 
in 
evolu
tionar
y 
s
tep
s 
197 

higher as well as lower than your own.  Some of these may 
ha,·e already completed their incarnation cycles and have 
ascended to return back as enriched entities within the 
Holy Monad and God.  Still others are on a different step 
of evolution and are still descending. 
This means that on Earth we could meet other 
personalities who belong to the same Holy Monad as us. 
One of these personalities could be a great saint and 
another temporarily lost sinner. So there are a number of 
individual personalities that are all members of the same 
Holy Monad. There is a  place within Absolute Beingness 
where all the Holy Monads are one.  So in the truest sense, 
all our fellow Human Beings are our own self in this regard 
no matter if they are expressing good or evil. This is known 
as the Common Selfhood of God.  This is what Christ was 
pointing to when he said, "Whatever you have done to the 
least of my   brothers, you have done to me". 
Please pay attention to this detail. God is one in His 
multiplicity. Even as the Trinity, God is one but expresses 
three other states - The Total Wisdom, the Total Love and 
the Total Power. Or what the church calls God the Father, 
God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. They are three 
different expressions of the one God.  In a somewhat 
198 

s
im
ila
r way 
we 
have one element 
call
e
d 
wat
e
r but w
e 
find it 
in 
thr
ee 
expression
s as solid (ice), 
liquid 
and vap
our.  So 
to
o 
we 
have the one 
element 
called fire but 
we  find it 
in 
th
ree 
expressions as flame, heat and 
light. 
We can say that our present day self-awareness is a 
radiance of our Holy Monadic Self, which has passed 
through the Human Idea.  From that moment the ray of 
Spirit 
pass through the Human Idea it is born as an entity. 
As a Holy Monad our Spirit is eternal, but from the instant 
it passes through the Human Idea archetype, a new 
expression begins. This new expression is our Soul and it 
is both eternal in nature and human in expression. So now 
we are dual in one.  \l(?e are one but now with a Divine 
Nature and a human nature.  The Holy l\fonad is us, the 
Spirit Ray is us and the Soul is us after we have put on the 
Human Idea. 
Try to remember that your Holy Monadic Self has 
no form it just is.    But what is it?  From the personality's 
level it is not understandable, because what we understand 
as a personality is what we have in our mind as thought, 
which is generated from knowledge. But your Holy 
Monadic Self in its Divine Self-Sufficiency has no need of 
knowledge about anything; it already has the knowledge of 
199 

eYernhing. 
This is because the nature of your Holy 
Mon
a
d 
fully partakes in the total wisdom, love and power of 
Absolute Beingness. This high reality cannot be perceiv
ed 
through the formulation of thoughts and ideas in time and 
place. 
Now it is just one small ray of the Holy M
onadic self 
at a certain point that becomes an entity. A monad is like 
a 
sun. How many rays does the sun have? There are 
countless rays yet all together they are as one sun. It is just 
one luminous ray of Spirit Life Light passed through the 
Archetypal Human Idea that forms the Soul. From that 
instant the formless Holy Monadic radiance takes on form. 
The Archetypal Ideas give a form with definitions to the 
Spirit Ray of Life-Light. 
So this ray of Spirit is formulated and shaped by the 
law concerning the Human Idea also known as the 
Heavenly Man archetype. From this moment it assumes its 
own 
separate brilliance within Absolute Beingness. Our 
ray of Spirit enters into a different domain of God's 
wisdom, love and power as a Soul. Now we have two 
secure footings for the Inner Self, the Holy Monadic Self 
within Absolute Beingness and Its projection, which is the 
Soul Self.

Souls 
can 
never 
be  lost,  evil, 
weaken
ed  or 
harmed in  any way. It is  the formation of  the Soul, which 
differentiates human beings from other Beings. For 
example the archangelic Beings do not have or need a Soul. 
Each Archangel belongs to a communal order; they are a 
system in  which all are equal to the others in that order. 
But for humans it is the Soul that holds the Divine 
Individualization and differentiates each one of us as 
unique member in the human race. 
Just as the eternal Spirit Being gives birth to the Soul 
Self, the Soul Self gives life to its own projections. Now 
the Soul begins to express itself as what we call the 
Permanent Personality, which is generically referred to by 
most as the Inner  Self. But our Spirit-Soul Inner Self must 
put on Noetical substance, Psychical substance and material 
substance to give us what we understand as human 
awareness. So the Permanent Personality creates its own 
p
rojections, and plunges into the worlds of  Existence to  get 
its direct experiences. In these time, space and place 
201 

worlds 
of Existence it puts the masks of many persona
litie
s 
over the course of its many, many incarnations. 
Now all the numerous Holy Monads, whose natures 
are similar, emanate many, many streams of radiances or 
rays. Again all these radiances from your Holy Monad do 
not present only yourself as a human being but also other 
Human Beings as well as archangelic Beings. This is why it 
is said we are true brothers with the Archangels. Of course 
they know this better than we do. They know themselves 
better than we do and they know us better than we do. 
But, definitely we will get to know them better in the 
future. 
Also within the Absolute Beingness, in both the 
manifested and un-manifested conditions are the Christ 
Logos and Holy Spirit. Human intelligence can only detect 
these two expressions of God, the Logos and the Holy 
Spirit. But it is quite likely that there are more than these 
two. Who knows how the archangelic Beings understand 
the expressions of God at this level. But the Human 
Beings can only understand these two qualities - the 
Logoic and the Holy Spiritual. 
Now the primary expression of God the Father is 
the total wisdom. The primary expression of God the Son 
202 

i
s 
t
o
ta
l love. 
The 
primary 
expressio
n of 
God 
the 
Holy 
Sp
irit 
is total 
powe
r.  Of course 
each 
has all 
three 
but 
exp
resses 
one more prominentl
y. 
As a simplistic metaphor, the Trinity and its work in 
creation is like a man working with his hands to make 
something. As you  observe him, you cannot tell what that 
man is having in his mind to make. But as you watch what 
his left  hand and right  hand are doing you can determine 
what that man has in mind by what is made by his two 
hands. 
Symbolically we could say that the man's head 
represents God  the Father. The man's  right hand 
represents God the Son and the left hand represents God 
the Holy Spirit. One man but three different parts used 
together to create.  Likewise with the Trinity, we cannot 
understand what God has in mind for creation other than 
observing what the Logos and the Holy Spirit create in the 
worlds of Existence. 
When Absolute Be-ness manifests as Absolute 
Beingness we now see the appearance of this Trinity. The 
Egyptians, the Hindus and others also identified and taught 
this triadic  nature of the Godhead. 
203 

So this is something about the knowable nature of 
God. But what is God? Saint John the Divine, stated, 
"God is Love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in 
God; and God in him". So a prime characteristic of God 
is Love. 
But God has other characteristics also such as Llfe, 
and Llght. At the highest level these are all one. In our 
three-dimensional world, light is really invisible except at its 
source or when it is reflected on sometnmg. We see the 
sun radiating light and the moon reflects this  light. We have 
all seen photos our beautiful blue planet from space. In 
these photos you see the Earth abundantly illuminated 
from the light of the sun, but the space between the sun 
and Earth is in darkness. In a similar way what we can 
know of God we can only see when reflected internally or 
externally. Everything around us as well as the inner 
worlds is a reflection of the truth of God. 
God's Llght is that very light of radiant Self­
Consciousness residing at the core of each and every being. 
God's life is everlasting. It is never-ending motion. It is in 
the creation, dissolution and regeneration of everything 
existing. God is Llfe and expresses I ts Llfe in Itself as 
Creation. 
204 

In an 
effort to 
understand the Divine Will 
Pleasure 
o
f 
G
od  to 
give 
birth to Creation, we discover 
that it begins 
as 
in 
a 
Divine 
Meditation as God contemplates 
the Divine 
P
lan, 
which becomes Creation. The Will Pleasure 
of God 
to 
unfold creation 
is like a prism through which 
the 
Everlasting Life-Llght radiates and refracts to present the 
colors of the archangelic Orders. 
Because of this Will Pleasure, which is Divine Love, 
the Divine Plan begins to unfold in the Eternal Now. 
The Divine Plan always has and always will be unfolding in 
the  Eternal Now. The Eternal Now is of the state we call 
Beingness. The first  state was the Be-ness, now we are 
speaking about the manifested state  called  Beingness, 
which is very different from the state  called  Existence that 
is more understandable to us.  Beingness is a non-dual, 
changeless, realm,  whereas Existence is a temporary,  always 
changing condition. It is in Existence that we find duality 
and 
mortality. 
So we have these two, the changing, relative reality 
of the Worlds of Existence and the permanent, absolute 
reality of Beingness. Existence has a definite beginning and 
end. However, Beingness is Eternal. It has no beginning. 
It has no end. In Existence there is a conditional sense of 
205 

space, place and time. Incarnated in the material world of 
Existence we find ourselves in a certain space-place at a 
certain moment in time but in a few hours' time we may be 
in another space-place. Beingness is not like that. In 
Beingness it is always here and always the Eternal Present. 
Our Selfhood partakes and enjoys both of these 
states of reality - the constantly changing states of 
Existence and the eternal realms of Beingness. We as 
Spirit-Soul Beings are eternal and we also have a temporary 
expression as a personality. Likewise, Life is Eternal but 
also Life expresses a temporary Existence as all the forms 
of life on Earth and in the other Worlds of Existence. 
Now, all forms of life are under constant change. The life 
forms may come and go but the Life animating these forms 
cannot be destroyed. Life may pass beyond our ability to 
perceive it but that does not mean it ceases. 
In the Causal States of Beingness we encounter the 
Divine archetypes containing the laws, causes, principles 
and ideas for all of creation. In the Causal States these are 
cared for by the very high archangelic Orders. The Causal 
States give rise to the Noetic State, now we find discernible 
forms in relation to each other. But these forms are not 
forms, as we understand them as measurable bodily forms.

Questions 
Q.  I would 
like to know 
the precise 
difference 
between 
use of "BE-ness" 
and 
"Beingness. 
Were 
they 
used 
interchangeably 
by Daskalos? 
When 
should 
we use one 
over 
the other? 
I've 
looked 
at the site extensively 
and 
they 
appear 
to be synonymous. 
A.  They 
are not synon
ym
ous. 
The 
Be-Ness 
is a 
reference 
to the unknowable 
un-manifested 
God. 
Beingness 
is God 
manifested. 
For this 
we also 
use the 
term 
The 
Trinity: 
God 
the Father, 
God 
the Son, 
God 
the 
Holy 
Spirit. 
Not 
three 
Gods 
but one 
God 
in three 
different 
expressions. 
No one 
can know 
what 
the Be-Ness 
really 
is.  But 
we can infer 
something 
about 
the Be-Ness 
from 
observing 
its manifestations 
as Beingness. 
The 
Be-Ness 
is 
symbolically represented 
by as a large 
equal 
sided 
triangle. 
Then 
if draw 
three 
smaller 
triangles 
inside 
the large 
one 
it 
symbolically 
represents 
the Trinity. 
This 
is the Absolute 
Infinite 
Beingness 
as shown 
on the S
ym
bol of Llfe 
painting. 

Meditation 
Rela
x co
mplet
ely. Start 
from 
the toes, 
then the legs, 
th
e 
thi
gh 
and 
then 
the abdomen. 
Feel your 
whole 
body 
but 
fe
el it 
comp
letely 
relaxed. 
Do it with 
full 
attenti
on 
but 
witho
ut any tension. 
Breathe deeply. We must learn the correct way of 
breathing deeply. Start breathing deeply and comfortably 
feeling the lower  part of your abdomen first and then the 
lungs. Then, empty  the abdomen first, and then, the lungs. 
Start with three beats of your heart. Three beats on the in 
breath and three  beats on the out breath. 
Breathe in for three beats of your heart as you fill the 
lower part of your lungs first then the u
pp
er part of the 
lungs. Now breathe out for three beats of your heart and 
empty the lower part of your lungs first and then the 
u
pp
er part of your lungs. 
When you breathe consciously like this you can draw 
in the etheric vitality better. Breathe in for three beats of 
the heart and without pausing ... breathe out for three beats 
of your  heart.  When you breathe out don't push the air 
ou
t, just let it escape gently. 
Again breathe in and out but this time as you let the 
air go out of your lungs notice that by using your mind you 
209 

can 
retain the etheric vitality component that was in t
he 
ai
r. 
Energy follows your attention so keep  your attention on 
your lungs so that only the used air goes out.  You keep 
th
e 
etheric vitality in you. 
Try it again. Breathe in for three beats of the heart 
and three beats of the heart as the air goes out of your 
lungs. Keep your awareness on the lungs and feel the 
etheric vitality stay there. Let the used air escape from your 
lungs. But the etheric vitality stays in and charges your 
lungs and chest with energy and power. 
Again breathe in three beats of the heart and as 
breath out release the air but keep your full attention the 
accumulating etheric vitality in the chest. You must train 
yourself in this way so as to begin to learn how to direct the 
energy in your body through your breath and attention. 
Now let's do it one more time but this time we will 
make it stronger by using visualization as we breathe. 
Breathe for three beats and visualize pure snow-white light 
entering your nostrils ... going down your windpipe ... and 
expanding the lungs comfortably. Filling the fill bottom of 
your lungs with this light first and then fill the top of your 
lungs with this light. Now as your release the air from your 
2!0 

l
u
n
g
s, 
keep y
our 
attention 
on your 
chest 
and see 
the 
lu
m
ino
us white light stay in your 
ches
t. 
One 
last time, 
breathe 
in  filling 
your 
lungs 
and 
chest 
wi
th 
etheric 
vitality 
that you now also see as 
the 
white 
light 
whi
ch is 
getting 
bright 
and brighter. 
Then 
breathe 
out 
lettin
g the  air 
gently 
escape, 
while 
retaining 
the 
vitality 
of 
the  pure 
white 
light. 
You should get used to this kind of breathing and in 
time  you  will  find  the  most comfortable way for you to do 
this exercise. Some prefer breathing for four beats or six 
beats of the heart. But avoid doing five beats of the heart. 
Later we will visualize different colors in order to give 
certain qualities to the etheric vitality. But first we must be 
start learning how to breathe properly. 
The next and final lesson for the year will be on the 
Archangels and their prayers. We have spoken about the 
Archangels a lot over the last year's lessons. But next time 
we will speak about some different kinds of Archangels 
too, these are the companion Archangels to Joshua 
Immanuel the Christ.

Chapter 8 
GLORY TO THE HIGHEST 
All the archangelic orders are Holy-Spiritual and 
Logoic. They perform great works in the laws, causes and 
principles that govern all the worlds of Existence and all 
forms of life within these worlds.  Yet there are other 
Monads of archangelic orders that are destine to specifically 
attend Christ Logos and His work in the universes. They 
are like companions to Christ Logos and His mission. 
These companion Archangels can be humanized. This 
means they, like the Christ Logos, honored the archetypal 
Human Idea and can know everything about the Idea of 
Man without the need of undergoing cycles of incarnation 
in order to learn this by experience. Mother Mary, the 
mother of Joshua Immanuel the Christ is one of these 
Archangels. 
The three sides of the top triangle on the S
ym
bol of 
Life represent one of the three main characteristics of God, 
which are Total Wisdom, Total Love and Total Power.  All 
the archangelic orders are found within this triangle. 
According to their place within the triangle they are 
performing their specific tasks in creation. 

G
od 
is 
Spir
it. 
Spirit 
means 
the 
everlasti
ng 
Selfho
od, 
w
h
ich 
is a 
prim
e 
characteristic 
of 
God. 
The 
word 
"Self'
, 
u
n
fo
rtu
nately 
gives 
us 
the 
impression 
that 
one 
self 
is 
s
ep
ara
ted 
from 
all 
other selves 
and 
from 
the 
whole 
of  God. 
We 
imag
ine 
we are 
a  separated 
self 
and 
have 
a 
separat
e 
exp
ressio
n. 
It may 
feel 
like 
that 
as a 
personalit
y but 
it 
is 
r
eally 
not 
possible. 
It is more 
like 
an 
apple 
blossom 
on 
a 
tree. The apple blossom has a separate expression from 
the tree trunk, from the branches and from the roots. But 
it is not possible for an apple blossom to have any living 
expression if it was really separated from the branch of the 
tree. 
Joshua said it this way, "I am the true vine, and my 
Father is the gardener. Abide in me and I in you. The 
branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it is connected to 
the vine; no more can you bear, except you abide in me. I 
am the vine, you are the branches: The one that lives in me, 
and I in him,  brings forth much fruit: for without me ye 
can do nothing." Now this is not an egoistic statement 
from a man who lived 2000 years ago. �'hen he says "me" 
he is speaking as the Logos, the manifestation of God, 
w
hich as John states at the beginning of his Gospel, "All 
things were made by him; and without him was not 
213 

anything made that was made." So here Joshua is not 
speaking as a personality but as the Christ principle. 
As a personality "self' we do not always feel 
connected to our source and so we may be tempted to 
think that "self' means we are separated from all other 
selves as well as from our source. If this were true we 
would not even exist. This sense of separateness is a 
phenomenon that is experienced only by the personality 
and is not the true reality. It is impossible to be separated 
from our source because it is in us and we are in it - always. 
What is possible is for the personality's awareness of the 
source to be eclipsed. 
Let's state this in another way. You cannot have the 
Existence of all the individual forms of life such as the 
plants, the animals and the human beings unless they have 
life in them. It is a mistake to think we can be separated 
from God or the Total Life. We are always in the 
omnipresence of God - the Absolute Life. 
What we call God is the Absolute Selfhood, but it is 
not possible to  understand what The Absolute Selfhood is 
with our brains. We can understand something about The 
Absolute Life by examining all the living forms of life, 
which have the same source. If we were to consider all the 
214 

for
m
s 
of  life 
on E
arth metaphorically 
as litt
le candles, 
then 
w
e 
can 
say G
od is like a great big candle 
with a huge 
flame. 
T
ha
t big 
candle flame 
lights all the other 
candles 
giving 
th
em 
Its 
life-light.  This big candle 
gives 
Its flame 
to the 
co
untless little 
candles without 
diminishi
ng 
Its own flame. 
In 
a 
similar way God, 
The Absolute 
Llfe, gives 
its life and 
light to all the innumerable forms of life without 
diminishing or diluting Its Llfe. 
Now the one Absolute Selfhood we call God, the 
Absolute Infinite Be-ness is both male and female. In the 
first manifestation of God, we first see the appearance of 
masculinity and femininity. The Absolute Beingness is the 
Holy Spirit and the Logos. The Logos' prime expression is 
the Universal Masculinity whereas the Holy Spirit's prime 
expression is the Universal Femininity. 
In our Spirit-Being-Self and in our Soul-Self we are 
both masculine and feminine too.  There was a time when 
the created human beings were both sexes. The first 
humans, the Adams were hermaphrodite and then much 
later the separation of the sexes occurred as described in 
t
he 
Bible. 
No
w, as 
a pers
onality 
self we primarily 
express 
one 
si
de 
or 
the 
other. 
We are expressing 
one 
side, while 
the 
215 

other side has been atrophied. We can see that in the 
human body, for example the breasts of males have been 
atrophied. In females that which is male has been 
atrophied. However, as Spirit-Souls we are both masculine 
and feminine - we are gods. But on the material plane to 
prolong life, it is necessary to have the two sexes. Here we 
need the cooperation of both aspects. 
Who is the Virgin Mary? We said she is from an 
archangelic order. As Mary the human being, she was 
perfectly expressing the pan-sympatric or universal 
femininity, which is creative and always virgin. She came 
from the archangelic order of the Principalities into the 
world by Immaculate Conception as the Catholic's rightly 
claim. She did not become the Virgin Mary by a series of 
progressive Earthly incarnations. She did not incarnate 
before being the Virgin Mary and she has not incarnated 
since. Mary embodied and reflected the purest ray of the 
universal femininity. She was, is and will always reflect the 
universal femininity of the Holy Spirit. Joshua Immanuel 
the Christ was is and will always reflect the universal 
masculinity of the Logos. 
Now what are the Archangels male or female? They 
are both. But when they express themselves they can give 
216 

us 
th
e 
ide
a of 
one or the other. 
However, 
accord
ing to 
the 
w
o
rk 
t
hey 
pre
form 
that classifies 
them 
in 
certai
n 
order
s w
e 
c
an 
call them 
male 
or 
femal
e. 
Som
e 
Archa
ngels, 
not all, like to present 
themselv
es 
in 
the 
human 
form. 
The  Michaels 
and 
Rapha
els, 
for 
e
xam
ple, 
presen
t themselves 
as males. 
The 
Gabriels, 
the 
Che
rubs 
present 
themselves 
as females. 
They 
have 
their 
own 
archangelic 
Form 
but they  also 
can  present 
themselves 
in 
any form 
they 
like because 
they 
have 
all the forms 
within 
them as their own property and they work in all the bodies 
of all forms of life. When they enter into the worlds of 
Existence they need a form, yet they are not imprisoned by 
the form as the human beings are. 
All 
the Archangels 
and all Spirit 
Beings 
have 
the 
Selfho
od in them 
and  they 
are  all 
in the Absolute 
Selfhood 
of God. The Archangels never come out of the At-One­
Ment with God. In the Absolute Selfhood of God and 
w
ithin their 
own 
Selfhood, 
another 
nature 
called 
the Will 
Ple
asu

initiates 
their

place. 
Their 
way 
of 
perfor
ming 
t
he
ir 
work 
is what 
classifies 
them 
into 
the 
vari
ous 
a
r
ch
ang
elic 
orders.  In other 
words, 
they 
"self-
classi
fy" by 
217 

using their own nature as Will Pleasure to express 
themselves. 
If you could raise your consciousness high enough 
you would be able to see these two natures. One is their 
unique expression of their work and the other is their 
oneness with God. This is why when Daskalos asks any 
archangel of any order: "Who is God?" They respond, "I 
am"! Then Daskalos would press the point and ask: "But 
you are different from the other orders of Archangels, what 
about them?" All reply, all they can reply is, "They are 
God!" They cannot make any distinction because all 
Archangels are all in At-One-Ment with God. The 
Archangels  feel in absolute  oneness with each other 
without affecting their individual work. In Greek this is 
called "Enoaesthesia" which means feeling as one with 
something. This enables the full cooperation and 
collaboration between the Archangels in the universes and 
in our bodies. 
Did the human beings leave this kind of oneness 
with the creator and the Archangels? We think we did but 
again, if did leave the oneness, if we did separate from our 
source we would cease to live just like a rose plucked from 
a rosebush. As personalities we do not need to concern 
218 

o
ur
s
elv
es too 
much 
with the nature 
of 
the 
Arch
angels. 
W
h
at  is 
impo
rtant is that we simply 
unders
tand 
that 
ev
ery
thing 
and every Being are in the 
oneness of 
God. 
Wh
at is 
important is to understand 
the part the 
Archangel
s 
p
lay 
in creation. 
The Archangels know the Mind in all its frequencies 
and how to use it flawlessly. They know what they are 
doing and that they are working in the bodies of all human 
beings in full harmony 24 hours a day, every day.  It 
behooves us to study their work in our bodies, cooperate 
with their work and be benefitted. It says in the Bible, that 
God said, "let us create man." This means to create man as 
something different. The Archangels create and maintain 
our human  bodies. They create your body and your body 
has its own consciousness, which is different from your 
consciousness as a personality. Also the Biblical account 
says, "God gave His breath of life to the created human 
beings." This is a reference to our Soul Self-Awareness. 
The material bodies of human beings are not all that 
different in composition from the animals except for the 
size and shape. Remember the human form is not the 
m
aterial, Psychical or Noetical body; it is the Soul.  Animals 
219 

do 
not have a Soul. They do not need a Soul for their 
ki
nd 
of life, their particular Circle of Possibilities. 
We lose our material body in the change we call 
death. The same happens to the Psychical body as well as 
the Noetical body. But our human form never gets lost ... 
it is forever - ceasing never.  This is our Soul nature, which 
never changes, and we never lose it.  So in this sense we 
can say that our bodies are not our form but the garments 
our human form wears from time to time. When we look 
in the mirror we see the shape of our body but we do not 
see the human form directly. It is clear that our body is 
very similar to the bodies of other human beings. The only 
difference is the height, weight and look. What is going on 
with  what we might call an ugly looking person? This  is 
only a distortion of the material body  and not  the human 
form. The human form of each of us is never ugly. It is 
always radiantly beautiful, just as the archangelic form is. 
As the Archangels are classified into their orders by 
the work they do.  Some get main positions others 
secondary and tertiary positions. The only real difference 
between them is the work they do.  As seekers of truth we 
are primarily interested in the seven orders of Archangels -
the creators, the builders. We are most interested in the 
220

ab
ility to 
be egofied 
with 
the human 
beings. 
It 
is this 
arc
hang
el whose 
ray will pass through 
the Human 
Idea 
archetype along with our Spirit ray as we become 
humanized and start the incarnational cycles. So we are not 
now nor have ever been alone. 
Not much is known about his archangelic order 
except it presents itself to us as an undistorted, perfectly 
clear mirror, which flawlessly reflects everything without 
being affected by what it reflects. All our mistakes, faults 
and transgressions may be reflected in that mirror so we 
can see them. It is this mirror presented by the Guardian 
Archangel that we will see when we pass over in the so­
called  life review. We will not see the guardian or even 
realize the Guardian Archangel is reflecting our own 
be
havior. 
If you 
behavior 
is not so good, 
you 
may 
wonde
r 
w
hat kind 
of 
monster 
you see before 
you. 
To 
which 
the 
g
uard
ian will 
reply 
as Yiohannan 
revealed, 
"That 
is you, 
not 
me.  I am  the mirror you  are  that monster 
i•ou see reflected 
in 
the 
mirror. 
Change 
what 
needs 
to be 
chang
ed so that 
y
ou r
eflect a 
better self." 
Reflecting 
our beha
viors 
is one of 
221 

the 
things the guardian does, sometimes if our behavi
or 
is 
very off we will feel  what Daskalos called  the "stings of 
consciousness." These are like painful slaps given not as a 
punishment but to wake us up, to alert us to our serious 
mistakes so that we will not remain in illusion. 
As incarnated human beings, we are in the worlds of 
duality and experience darkness and light. For us it is 
necessary to have the duality in order to compare things to 
gain understanding. But the Archangels have no 
experience or concepts of darkness they know only light, 
because they are always in the inextinguishable light. Yet 
we perceive this inextinguishable light as darkness. When 
we see darkness it is really only in our mind because what 
we call darkness is really just the superlight, the 
inextinguishable light, which is beyond the range our eyes 
can perceive. 
In communication with our Guardian what will we 
hear? We will hear voice of our own consciousness. It is 
not that the guardian desire to reflect our mistakes or to 
criticize and rebuke us. But as they come to us their 
vibration resonates on our consciousness. This means if 
we have a guilty consciousness the resonance will give us 
grief. So if you have a guilty consciousness, clean it before

Christ 
said joy to your 
angels in 
heav
en for 
the one who 
repents 
and returns 
to 
his 
own 
nature. We do not have the right to cause grief to our 
guardian or any archangel. They are always working for us. 
They are love. 
We all have heard the story of Joseph, Mary and the 
birth of Christ in the manger. But let's detail it a bit to 
help us enter more deeply into the circumstances and 
meaning of that Holy Night. As you know Christ was born 
into the Essene community. The Essenes, sometimes 
called Nazarenes, were Greco-Israelites living in Palestine. 
They were peace-loving people who worshiped the one 
Spirit God, God of Heaven and of Earth - the God of 
Love and Mercy. Greek was their mother language and 
they also spoke the Aramaic of the day. 
They had their own way of life and their own 
temples where they worshiped a loving God who they 
considered the father of all human beings. The Essenes did 
not believe in the cruel and vengeful God of the Jews and 
223 

so the Jews were considering the Essenes heretics.  The 
Essenes did not want to separate themselves from their 
brother Jews and take protective citizenship under the 
heathen Romans who worshipped many Gods. So they 
remained under the oppressive control of King Herod and 
the Sanhedrin who often accused the Essenes of violating 
Jewish law for which the punishment was stoning. 
The Spiritual head of the Essenes at this time was 
the high priest Joachim, a very righteous man who was 
married to Hanna.  Hanna was an educated Essene woman 
who was the sister of Simon, the second in order Essene 
high priest. Joachim and Hanna lived in an Essene 
community in a suburb of Jerusalem where they gave birth 
to their first daughter Elizabeth. Later Elizabeth gave birth 
to John the Baptist by Immaculate Conception. 
Joachim and Hanna also gave birth to a second 
daughter Miriam Shalom. Miriam Shalom later gave birth 
by Immaculate Conception to the discipleJohn,John the 
evangelist, which is our Yiohannan. As Daskalos revealed 
both John and the Virgin Mary were Christ's companion 
Archangels who came directly from the orders of the 
Principalities - their coming into this world was by 
Immaculate Conception. 
224 

T
wo y
ears 
after Joachim 
passed over 
Hanna was 60 
ye
ar
s o
ld 
and 
she was feeling she was p
regnant 
again.  She 
r
ev
ealed 
this to her brother 
the high 
priest 
Simo
n.  She 
was 
sh
ocked 
when he said he already 
knew as the 
Archang
el
G
abriel had 
revealed 
it to 
him. 
Gabriel 
told 
him 
that 
Han
na would 
give birth 
to a daughter 
by 
Immacul
ate 
Conc
eption. 
The daughter 
was Mary who was destined 
to 
be the mother of Jesus Christ the long awaited Messiah. 
All this is in the Bible. 
Gabriel instructed that Hanna must devote her 
daughter Mary to Spiritual service as a White Dove of the 
Heavens. The White Dove of the Heavens is an order in 
the Essene temples where the child from age three on is 
brought up in the temple. In the temple Mar
y 
was trained 
in the service of God and man where she remained a Yirgin. 
When a White Dove of the Heavens was reaching 
the age of thirteen she was given into a Wbite j\larriage by 
an Essene priest. In a White Marriage, the man was to take 
care of the woman as his own child and would not have 
relations with her.  She was to remain pure.  So at thirteen 
Mary was given to Joseph, who was a widowed carpenter 
with six children from his previous marriage. Joseph 
bro
ught Mary 
to live in his 
hom
e. 
225 

Then 
at the age of fifteen, 
the Archangel Gabriel 
came 
to her and 
announced 
that 
she would 
give 
birth 
by 
Immaculate 
Conception 
to the Son 
of God 
the Messiah 
whose 
coming 
was 
foretold 
by the prophets. 
Even 
though 
Joseph 
knew 
of the message 
given 
by Gabriel, 
he fell into 
great 
confusion 
about 
Mary's 
pregnann·. 
After 
all he was 
not a religious 
scholar 
he was 
a simple 
carpenter. 
He 
became 
greatly 
concerned 
wondering 
what 
the Essene 
community 
would 
think. 
They 
had 
given 
him 
Mary 
to keep 
her a virgin 
and 
now, 
she was 
pregnant. 
He feared 
they 
would 
blame 
him. 
But soon 
the Archangel 
Gabriel 
came 
to 
him, 
comforting 
him 
and revealing 
Mary 
was 
indeed 
pregnant 
by the Holy 
Spirit. 
As you 
know 
from 
the Bible, 
King 
Herod 
ordered 
a 
census 
to be taken 
requiring 
everyone to 
return 
to the city 
of his or her birth 
to be counted. 
So Joseph, 
along 
with 
Mary 
who 
was 
in her ninth 
month, 
had 
to return 
to 
Bethlehem 
for this census. 
Unfortunately 
all the house 
an
d 
inns 
in Bethlehem 
were 
over 
full because 
of the census. 
It was 
a mild 
night 
and Joseph 
had 
notice 
a large 
cave 
outside 
the city and 
returned 
to it to take 
shelter 
there. 
A 
shepher
d named 
Nathaniel 
had a small 
house 
nearby 
an
d 
used 
this 
cave 
to shelter 
his sheep 
and 
cows. 
When 
Joseph 
226 

a
n
d 
M
ar
y 
arrived 
at this cave 
N
athaniel 
and his help
ers 
h
ad 
a
lr
ead
y taken 
his flock 
of sheep 
out  to p
asture, 
leavin
g 
only 
t
wo 
cows in 
the cave. 
So Joseph 
and Marry 
enter
ed the 
c
ave and  settle 
in. 
Joseph prepared a place with some woolen blankets 
on one side of the cave for Mary to lie down. Two torches 
illuminated the  cave as she rested from the long journey. 
Joseph  found some wooden buckets and leaving Mary in 
the cave went to find water. When he returned he found 
Mary sitting up and holding the Christ child in her  arms. 
Again he was in confusion as he wondered how Mary had 
given  birth without any help. The baby Jesus did not need 
to  be washed and  there was no blood an)where. Mary had 
taken the  white cloth from her head, traditionally worn by a 
White Dove of the Heavens, wrapped the Christ child and 
p
ut him in the manger. Joseph was trying hard to 
understand how the Son of God, the saYior of mankind, 
could be born in a cave and put in a manger full of straw. 
As 
Josep
h struggle 
to understand 
what 
was 
h
app
ening, 
the 
shepherd 
Nathaniel, 
was 
tendin
g his 
sheep 
nea
rby 
when 
an Archangel 
appeared 
annou
ncing to 
him 
and 
the 
other 
shephe
rds: "Be  not 
afraid
. I b
ring 
good 
ti
dings 
of 
great joy 
to all people. 
For 
there 
is 
born 
this day 
227 

a Savior who is Christ the Lord. You will find Him in   a 
manger wrapped in swaddling cloth". 
Then suddenly a host of Archangels began praising 
God singing, "Glory to God in the Highest, Peace on 
Earth and Goodwill towards Men."  (When the Archangels 
rejoice they like to sing.)  Hearing all that, Nathaniel and 
the other shepherds, returned to the cave to find the Christ 
child lying in the manger just as the Archangel had said. 
He told Joseph, "Outside the Archangels are singing.  All 
of us have seen them. All of us have heard them say the 
Savior has been born and is lying in a manger." Hearing 
this, Joseph's confusion vanished. 
Nathaniel took the Holy Family to Nathaniel's 
house, which was nearby. The shepherds returned to 
tending the flock of sheep and feeling exhausted, Nathaniel 
and the Holy Family fell into a deep  sleep.  They were 
awakened by the sound of camel bells at dawn and a knock 
on the door. It was the three kings bearing gifts for the 
Christ child as mentioned in the Bible.  They had been 
following the bright star in sky that guided them to the 
birth of the savior. 
Now the Christian religion called this star of 
Bethlehem a five-pointed star.  What is the symbol of a 
228 

fi
v
e-p
ointed 
star? 
The 
shape 
of the five 
pointed 
star

The 
five-pointed 
star 
is the  symbol 
of 
the perfec
t 
man. 
Christ 
honored 
the archetypal 
human 
idea 
passing 
throu
gh this 
archetype 
to be born 
on Earth 
as the 
perfect 
God  and perfect man. This is why we call him the God­
Man. So a symbol of the five pointed star is God that 
becomes a human  being not an ordinary human being but a 
perfect human being. 
Geometrical Forms are a tangible expression of the 
numbers. The numbers belong to the Noetic world of 
principles, which become geometrical forms when they 
come  down to the material level. For example the number 
three is the triangle and the number five is the five-pointed 
star. When we visualize a geometric form with a good 
understanding of the meaning of its symbol, a combination 
of ideas forms and a definite state of consciousness appears 
ins
ide us. 
The five-pointed star as a symbol of a human being 
is the number five. We have the five senses: sight, hearing, 
smell, taste and touch. Touch is the sense nearest to matter 
and the hand is the primary part we use for touch. The 
229 

hand also has the number five - five fingers.  These 
correspondences show that a human being is like a living 
five-pointed star at the material level. But we also have the 
correspondence at the Spiritual level in the five virtues, 
which are Goodness,Justice, Wisdom, Truth and Love. 
These are also called the virtues of Christ. 
Goodness is a solid base, a foundation on which we 
stand and are supported by.  So this virtue is associated 
with the feet. Justice is a measure. To be fair with others 
and ourselves requires us to know how to measure in order 
to keep balance. Fairness is balance. The virtue of Justice, 
which again is a measure, is associated with the hands. 
The virtue of Wisdom serves as a   protective barrier, 
from external dangers or dangers within our own 
personality.  Wisdom is associates with the Ears.  Truth is 
the light that lights our way and is associated with the eyes. 
Love is a force that expands one's being and links us with 
all other beings. Love gives joy and without it our life 
would have little meaning. Love is associated with the 
mouth. Goodness,Justice, Wisdom, Truth and Love are 
our human points of contact and interaction with these 
harmonious forces in the universe, which bring us real 
blessings. 
230 

As we know as the first of the three kings, the 
Maharaja Ram approached the Christ child and removed 
his outer kingly  purple cloak and wrapped it around the 
manger revealing his  white  under garments. Researchers of 
Truth of  the inner circles sometimes wear white robes as 
symbols of the purity of their intent, dedication and in 
reverence for this moment. 
The Maharajah next removed his sword, put his 
right foot on a stool, and pressed the sword  against  his 
thigh. The sword snapped in half.  He set the two pieces of 
the  broken blade at the foot of manger where the Godchild 
lay, proclaiming, "My Lord, at your feet are all power and 
authority." This is the origin of the Un-pointed Sword of 
peace, reason and love. Daskalos had a reproduction of 
this sword he used to initiate students into the various 
circles of the System for the Research of Truth. 
The Maharajah was praying by the manger and when 
he finished he stood and exclaimed, "Harn El Khior!" In 
his Sanskrit language this meant, "] see God". Thereafter 
the Maharajah Rama-Touaivahan was called Harn El Khior 
or Melchior as it is written in the Bible. The two other 
kings, Caspar and Balthasar also approached the Christ 
child lying in the manger, made their prayers and presented 
231 

their gifts. The Maharajah then beckoned one of his 
attendants to approach with a large, wooden box. He 
placed this at the feet of the virgin mother saying, "My 
Lady, mother of the Son of God, accept this gold as a 
token of our love. You will soon have need of it."  He told 
the Holy family to leave this Bethlehem before noon, 
because King Herod will soon start killing the children. 
King Herod aware of the prophecy foretelling of the 
coming of the Messiah decided to kill all :he recently born 
males in and around Bethlehem to prevent the coming of 
the savior.  The Bedouin King, Balthasar, came forward 
giving Joseph and Mary Bedouin robes saying for safety, 
dress yourselves as Bedouins and leave Bethlehem 
immediately. 
The three Magi, with their quest fulfilled, mounted 
their horses and camels. With hearts lifted up and full of 
peace, the pilgrims departed Bethlehem to spread the 
jo
y
ous news. 
By noon Joseph, Mary and the Christ child, left 
Bethlehem for Nazareth dressed as Bedouins. There 
Joseph told his son James (who would become one of the 
twelve disciples) they had to leave for Egypt and to sell his 
property. They left Nazareth to go to a suburb of 
232 

Je

on 
the eight day to see Mary's 
Uncle Simon, 
the 
hi
gh 
priest of 
the Essenes, 
fulfilling 
the 
promise 
of 
A
rcha
ngel G
abriel that Simon would 
see the 
Messiah 
be

over.  The holy family, 
disguised as 
Bedo
uins, joined a 
big Bedouin 
caravan 
headed 
for Egypt 
and 
traveled 
along the eastern banks 
of the Dead Sea. 
This 
large 
caravan 
consisted 
of 45 camels, ten armed horsemen 
for protection and a dozen carts full of goods, the Holy 
Family escaped Palestine and eventually settled in Essene 
community in Heliopolis Egypt until King Herod died and 
they could return. 
We were saying something about the deep and 
mystical meanings behind the Star and the birth of Christ in 
a manger so long ago.  But why was God born in a  manger 
inside a cave?  What is the symbol of the manger? Of 
course there is the symbol of the King of Heaven and 
Earth being born in a humble manger and not a fancy 
palace. Humility is a foundation stone in the teachings of 
Christ. 
A manger is a crib-like object that holds the hay that 
feed gentle domesticated animals - sheep, cows, etc. The 
cave symbolically represents our body and the manger 
represents our heart center. The gentle animals represent 
233 

ordinary tamed human emotions that we all keep and 
express as feelings and desires. This means that as a 
personality Christ can be born in our hearts if all we keep 
there are tamed emotions and desires. But if our 
heart/ manger is a feeding ground for wild emotions and 
untamed desires it will not be possible for the Christ 
consciousness to be born in us until we clean our heart 
properly. So we should check during our nightly 
Introspection to see if our heart is like a sii-.,μlc manger for 
tame emotions or if it is more like an overgrown jungle 
with wild emotions such as anger, jealousy, hatred and the 
desire of wanting to take revenge or to do harm. 
Why were the Archangels rejoicing the night Christ 
was born? Why did Christ come to the world, what did he 
come for? He came to wake us up to our Divine Nature, 
to prove to us we are gods, sons and daughters of the 
Almighty. Humankind then and now are in a heavy sleep 
dreaming their dreams of separateness. We are dreaming 
that we are only a little limited self-consciousness often 
times suffering with pain and sorrow; sometimes feeling 
weak and separated from our real Self and its source. 
Christ came to save us from all that, urging us, 
persuading each of us to seek the truth and be free. This 
234 

means finding the truth sets us free from the painful 
illusions that are troubling and binding us to the limited 
consciousness of our personality. He has shown the way 
but we still need to cover that way with our own steps. To 
do that, study all the levels of our own Selfhood from our 
p
resent-day 
personality, to the  Permanent 
Personality, to 
the  Soul Self-Awareness and to the Spirit-Being Self. We 
have to contemplate and meditate on all that just to find 
where we are right now. We can easily see that not all 
people are standing on the same rung of the Spiritual ladder 
we call Selfhood. This is because they do not want to stand 
at the same level. 
Christ came to wake us up, to show us the way to 
master our physical life, our emotions and our thoughts. 
Most importantly He showed us how to stand up, discover 
who and what we really are and receive the Spiritual 
inheritance prepared for us. 
Will we be satisfied and content then? Yes, because 
we will be able to dis-entangle our sense of self from that 
of the personality and rightly transfer it to our Soul-Self. 
We will clearly see our own Spiritual progress. We will see 
real proof that our Spiritual efforts are working. For 
example, you will see that the people or events in your life 
235 

that use to bother you, really shake you up and even torture 
you will no longer disturb you. Now when they come to 
you they will not trouble, torment or worry you and they 
will pass from you uneventfully. You will become much 
more patient and tolerant of others. Now you will not 
consider the weaknesses and behaviors of others as serious 
crimes. Instead you will see them as ignorance or 
undeveloped awareness. 
This is the evidence you are progressi"-g on the right 
way. Your attitude towards life and your fellow human 
beings change completely and you will have greater peace 
and live a happier life.  This is the good news Christ came 
to show us.  This is why the Archangels sang and continue 
to sing to this day, "Glory to God in the Highest, Peace on 
Earth and Goodwill towards Men!" 

Questions 
Q.As I am working with the exercises, I am 
wondering if you could explain the significance of the 
different colors that are being used. 
A. In our practices we work colored lights and 
combinations of colored lights. Of course pure snow­
white light represents God and we know all the colors of 
light are contained within the white light. In general, the 
main colors we work are associated with the four main 
Archangels and the Trinity. 
Yellow and golden is of the Trinity. The Archangel 
Nlichael's light is red, in all its shades. He is the Archangel 
of light and fire.  Archangel Gabriel's light is sky-blue in 
many different shades of blue, which gi,·es peace and 
tranquillity. Raphael is the Archangel of etheric ,·itality and 
the electromagnetic force. He is characterized by all the 
shades of violet. This color derives from the mixture of red 
(Nlichael) and blue (Gabriel), and thus reveals the role of 
Raphael as co-worker with the other two. His work with 
the etheric vitality is vital in the maintenance of good health 
in each of us.  Archangel Uriel, the great harmonizer of 
substance, keeps the Uniwrsal Law of Order and 
Harm
ony, both 
within and between 
each 
body. U
riel's 
237 

,·ibrations create shades of silvery white light. 
In general, the colors associated with good health of 
the bodies are bluish white light is used for good health of 
the material body. Rosy white light is the love of the Logos 
and used for good health of the Psychical body. Canary 
yellow is used for the good health of our Noetical body. 
Of course the colors are not just limited to these 
applications only. 
Now we all know that pure water is guud for us.  We 
know that pure food is good for us as is pure air.  It is the 
same with the colors. Pure, clear colors also have a 
beneficial effect on us.  Our good and bad emotion and 
thought forms the elementals get a form and color. 
Elementals in black colors are dangerous, dark brown ones 
indicated negative influences and colors such as putrid 
green indicate envy. Of course positive angelic rype 
elementals have radiant clear, clean, beautiful colors. So we 
use the clear, pure colors in our exercises to clean our 
etheric centers and cause certain effects in us, like calmness 
and tranquillity. 

Meditation 
Prayers of the Archangels 
Close your eyes and relax you heart, mind and body. 
Breathe deeply, consciously and feel the toes of both feet. 
As you concentrate in the feet, slowl
y
, move your attention 
to the Souls of the feet and now to the ankles. 
Come up to the lower legs, which mean to feel the 
toes, the feet and the lower legs all together. Now go 
further up  to   your thighs and really feel you  are there.  We 
are using the aesthetic ether to feel  being in the legs.  Come 
all the way up to the pelvis and feel being there. 
Now feel the whole abdominal area.  Breathe deeply, 
comfortably, and consciously. Using the imprinting ether, 
visualize a beautiful sky blue ball of light that covers the 
whole abdomen and extends outside the body in the front, 
back and sides.  Feel the center of this sky blue sphere of 
light, which is situated behind the navel.  Breathe deeply 
and feel this center of the sky blue sphere. 
Now mentally order your Sub-Consciousness to 
keep your body in good health. This is a powerful 
autosuggestion that your Sub-Consciousness will obey. 
Now come up to the chest and feel the area from the 
thyroid to the sternum. Breathe deeply and see a ball of 
239 

luminous pale rosy light take shape in this center. This 
radiant rosy sphere extends in front and behind your chest. 
Mentally ask Christ to help you clean your emotions, 
desires and weaknesses. Come up slowly to the head and 
see a golden sun of clear light in and around your head. 
Feel you are there in your head and your head is in the 
center of this sun of golden light. Consciously clean your 
thoughts in this light. Now you ask God the father directly 
to guide you. 
Silently say: Glory to God in the Highest and 
consciously enter in to the meaning of this prayer. Say it 
again: Glory to God in the Highest. 
Slowly come back down to your heart center and 
silently say:  Peace on Earth Goodwill towards Men. This 
is the prayer of the Archangels. They feel you now; they 
know what you are doing now. Mentally thank them for 
the work they do in your bodies. 
Now say: Lead us while being in temptation and 
deliver us from evil. Being tempted is a trial being in 
temptation is an ordeal we undergo. Lead us while being in 
temptation but deliver us from evil. 
We are in God and God is in us.  Whatever we are 
doing whatever we are thinking, He knows. So ask God: 
240 

Lead u
s w

GLOSSARY OF TERMS 
Our System for the Research of Truth employs 
terms and concepts in a particular fashion. The translators 
have labored to preserve the eloquence contained in the 
Greek original. To avoid confusing our language and 
terminology with that of other schools and other 
disciplines, and to gain clarity over the material, we appeal 
to the readers to consult this glossary. 
ABSOLUTE BEINGNESS, INFINITE 
BEINGNESS, GOD, THE FATHER, THE LORD, 
THE HIGHEST. 
These terms are used interchangeably. In spite of the 
use of masculine pronouns with any of the above terms, 
Absolute Beingness and any of the other expressions used 
for God are without gender. God is all and everything. 
ARCHANGELS, ANGELS 
Holy Spiritual Beings assisting in the construction 
and maintenance of the worlds. They possess Total 
Wisdom and Absolute Self-awareness (though lacking the 
self-conscious individuality specific to humans). We speak 
in praise of the Archangels of the elements, the Orders of 
242 

Authorities, 
of Cherubim, of Dominions, of Overlords, of 
Principalities, of Seraphim and of the Thrones. In our work 
we speak of seven Orders of Archangels, each composed 
of billions and billions of Holy Monadic Beings serving 
Creation. Angels are Elementals of the Archangels. 
ARCHANGELIC MAN 
Archangelic Man is one of the Ideas (see 'Heavenly 
Man' and 'Causes, Ideas and Principles' below). The Holy 
Monadic emanation passes through the Idea of archangelic 
Man on its way to the Idea of Heavenly Man, thus the 
Archangels are the brothers of humanity. 
AT-ONE-MENT 
The super-conscious state in which a Being is able to 
merge itself in total  oneness with any other Being or 
Existence, and with Absolute Beingness in Theosis, 
without ever abandoning its Ego. 
ATTUNEMENT 
Attunement means adjusting our vibrations to the 
frequency of any other Existence or Being to the extent 
243 

that we can observe and study its nature. Attunement is 
reached prior to at-one-mint. 
BEING and EXISTING 
Existing has a beginning and an end and is thus a 
timed or temporal phenomenon. Being is timeless and 
eternal, without beginning or end. 
CAUSES, IDEAS and PRINCIPLES 
The Will-pleasure of Absolute Beingness is the 
primal Cause, as it is the cause of Creation. It is from 
within the Will-pleasure of Absolute Beingness, all the 
Causes spring. Causes then give rise to Ideas. Every Idea 
holds within it the whole Cycle of Possibility of the form to 
be created. Archangels work through the Ideas and impart 
Total Wisdom to each form. Principles govern the 
expression of Causes in time and space. 
CAUSAL STATE 
Above the Noetic State, the causal state is a 
condition of pure Ideas and Principles. It is also known as 
the fifth heaven. 
244 

CAUSE AND EFFECT, 
LAW 
OF 
Scientists as well as mystics recognize the Law of 
Cause and Effect. This Divine  Law  requires every action to 
result in a reaction. Yet,  whereas  Eastern religions often 
teach a deterministic view of this Law (terming it Karma), 
we believe that debts can be born for others or transcended 
through repentance (see below) and reparation. The Law of 
Cause and Effect operates over several  lifetimes as well as 
within much shorter periods. 
CHRIST, CHRIST LOGOS, LOGOS, LOGOI, 
LOGO IC 
The Greek word Logos can be translated as 'word' 
(as the Authorized Version does in the first chapter of St. 
John's gospel). Christ, as used here, alone or in conjunction 
with Logos, refers to the 'Only Begotten Son'. \Xben Jesus, 
as the incarnation of the  Christ Logos, is specificalh· meant, 
He is sometimes referred to as 'the i'vlost Belm·ed Logos'. 
In our work, we often speak of the Holy Logos and the 
God-Man Jesus Christ, a full, direct, and pure incarnation 
of the Logoic expression of Absolute Beingness, 
245 

synonymously. Logoi is the plural of Logos, Logoic is the 
adjective. 
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, COSMIC 
MEMORY 
Here every event, past and present, in all the worlds 
is recorded. A mystic can perform research by attuning 
himself to the Cosmic Consciousness. Contained within the 
Cosmic Consciousness is the Cosmic Memory. This is the 
'heavenly archive' where the impressions, actions, thoughts, 
emotions and desires of all the Beings are recorded. 
CYCLE/CIRCLE OF POSSIBILITIES 
The Cycle of Possibility of each form is laid down in 
Total Wisdom in the Divine Laws and Causes. All forms 
are continually developing: from seed to tree, from child to 
adult. Each form changes so that experience may be 
gathered. In the Eternal Now a form is complete and based 
on a Principle, with its Cycle of Possibility already 
established. On entering the Worlds of Existence (material, 
Psychical and Noetical), the Cycle of Possibility is inscribed 
on the Permanent Personality, and parameters are set (time 
and place). No form may escape its Cycle of Possibility, 
246 

thus 
ruling 
out  transmigration 
from 
one 
form to 
any 
other 
(hu
mans 
will always 
reincarnate 
as hum
ans). 
CYCLE/CIRCLE 
OF PROBABILITIES 
While 
the cycle 
of possibilities 
is the ideal 
development 
and 
is inescapable, 
the cycle 
of probabilities 
allows 
for the halting 
of a developing 
life at any point 
of its 
development. 
A seed 
may 
not grow, 
a young 
tree may 
become 
diseased 
and 
die, or a child 
may 
pass 
over. 
Within 
each 
Cycle 
of Possibility, 
we find 
millions 
of cycles 
of 
probabilities; 
it is probable 
that 
something 
or  someone 
may 
stop 
existing 
or, conversely, 
continue 
to exist. 
Each 
Cycle 
of Possibility, 
whether 
fulfilled 
or interrupted, 
has great 
wisdom  behind 
it in serving 
the Law. 
DIVINE 
Used 
only 
for the Qualities, 
Causes, 
Ideas, 
Laws 
and 
Principles, 
and 
Beings, 
which 
emanate 
directly 
from 
Absolute 
Beingness. 
DIVINE GRACE 
247 

It is a gift of Divine Grace that we exist as humans, 
in our bodies, in the universes. 
DIVINE LAWS 
The Divine Laws are the basic structure of Creation, 
governing all worlds and universes, and corresponding to 
our higher nature. Epitomizing Reason and Love 
manifested, it is our recognition of, and alignment with, 
these Laws (e.g., of Cause and Effect, of Harmony, of 
Order, of Growth of Love), which leads to our balanced 
and enhanced Spiritual development. 
DIVINE MEDITATION 
Intricately linked to the Will-pleasure of Absolute 
Beingness to express Itself within Itself. Divine Meditation, 
for lack of a better term, is believed to be the state prior to 
the Will-pleasure where Absolute Beingness contemplates 
expression. Within Divine Meditation Creation is 
conceived. 
DIVINE MERCY 
A little understood, but most compassionate force in 
Creation, that permits the seeming miraculous to take 
248 

p
lace. James, 
in his epistle, 
wrote, 
1
and mer
c
y rejoi
ces 
against judgment' 
(3:13). 
DIVINE PLAN 
The Divine Plan is a blueprint of Creation, perfect 
and complete, accounting for everything and for all 
occurrences. Attuning our thoughts and actions to the 
most-wise Divine Plan of Absolute Beingness is the 
purpose of our Existence. 
ECSTASY 
Ecstasy is a going out from oneself into the 
Kingdom of Heavens through expansion, At-One-Ment 
and/ or Attunement. Ecstasy implies a passing beyond all 
conceptual thinking of discursive reason. 
EGO and EGOISM 
Our use of these terms is not to be confused with 
contemporary Psychological terminology. Egoism deftles 
Mind by the   construction of selfish desires, and by the base 
emotions of greed, malice and envy. The Ego (with a 
capital E) is the Self as Beingness, the Soul nature, and is 
reflected through a  reasoning and loving personalit
y
. While 
249 

egoism (a weakness of our present personality) is the 
source of disease throughout the personality, the nation 
and the world, our Ego nature brings forth love, 
compassion, reasoned thinking and reasoned action. 
ELEMENTALS 
Every thought, emotion and desire creates and 
transmits an Elemental-also called thought-form-that 
carries on an Existence of its own. We create and 
regenerate two types of Elementals. When an emotion 
governs a thought, we have created emotional thought­
forms, or desire-thoughts. When our ideas, desires and 
emotions pass through reason and love, we create reasoned 
thought-forms, or thought-desires. An Elemental can never 
be destroyed, only dis-energized (by no longer feeding the 
Elemental with Etheric Vitality). Elementals of a kind 
collect to form powerful group Elementals. If an individual, 
or a collection of individuals, are vibrating at the same 
frequency, they will attract such group Elementals. 
Archangels also create Elementals: benign and angelic in 
the service of humanity. 
ETERNAL NOW, ETERNAL PRESENT 
250 

Bey
ond 
the 
Worlds of Existence 
is the Eternal 
Now, 
the 
state 
of 
Everlasting Life. There, past, 
present and 
future 
collapse 
into a single present, without 
time or   place. 
ETHER, ETHERIC VITALITY 
'Our daily bread', Etheric Vitality (lvlind) is obtained 
through breathing, meditation, eating and rest. \X'e swim in 
a sea of Etheric Vitality which surrounds and permeates the 
globe, yet, through disharmonious lifestyles; most of us 
exhaust our portion of Etheric Vitality and are unable to 
restore it, leading to phvsical and psychic distress. All 
Existence, including our bodies, is constructed within a 
mold of ether (the Etheric Double). We speak of four 
conditions of ether: creative, sensate, imprint and kinetic. 
ETHERIC CENTERS, SACRED DISCS 
Centers of energy and acti,-ity (Sanskrit: Chakras) 
located at various points on the Etheric Doubles of our 
bodies. Each of the three bodies, from the gross material to 
the more refined, displays these centers, which correspond 
to organs of the material body. We must exercise care in 
working with these centers, for while it is necessary for us 
to develop and awaken certain of them, others are the 
251 

domain of the Holy Spirit, the Archangels and the Logos 
(e.g., the 'root' and the heart centers) and we should refrain 
from any manipulation or direct interference. (For 'Heart 
Center' see below) 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
Each body of every Existence, from the simplest to 
the most complex structures, possesses an Etheric Double 
centered within the body and extending slightly beyond it. 
The Etheric Double exists as long as the body (whether 
material, Psychical or Noetical) is projected. When a body 
is withdrawn (passes over) its Etheric Double dissolves. 
The Etheric Double serves as the mold for the body's 
construction as well as in the preservation of the body's 
health. 
EXOSOMATOSIS 
Exosomatosis, is the literal Greek equivalent of the 
English expression 'out of body experience'. We all leave 
our bodies each night, during sleep, and travel to other 
planes Sub-Consciously. 

The 
aim, 
however, is to live consc
iously while 
out of 
our bodies. We know of first, second and third 
Exosomatosis. 
GUARDIAN ARCHANGEL 
At the point of our first incarnation, upon passing 
through the  Human  Idea, the 
Self-aware Soul is protected and guided, throughout 
its long sojourn into the worlds of separation, by an 
Archangel. This Archangel, our faithful companion, is from 
the Archangels of the Thrones. 
GROSS MATERIAL WORLD, BODY 
The material world is the lowest manifestation and 
vibration of i\llind. Matter is i\llind  made  solid to compose 
the material world and material bodies. 
FAITH 
Not only an individual or theoretical belief in the 
dogmatic truths of a religion, but  an all-embracing 
relationship, recognition of, and love for Absolute 
253 

Beingness. As such it involves a complete transformation 
of a person's personality, whereby we are taken up into the 
whole the anthropic activity of God in Christ and of man 
in Christ through which we achieve Theosis. Faith, above 
all, is an active virtue: 'Faith without works is dead ... ' Games 
3:26). Also see 'Repentance' below. 
HEAVENLY MAN/HUMAN IDEA 
The Idea of Man or Human Idea is an archetype. 
Our bodies are constructed according to the Causal Law of 
the Heavenly Man -Human Idea - Human Form. 
HEART CENTER 
Not simply the physical organ but the Spiritual 
center of Mankind's Being. Man made in the image of 
Absolute Beingness as reason and love, our truest self, our 
inner sanctum, through which the mystery of the union 
between the Divine and the mundane is consummated. 
'Heart' has thus an all-embracing significance. Prayer of the 
heart means prayer not just in the emotions and affections, 
but also of the whole person. We should strive to purify 
this heart for 'God knoweth your hearts,' writes Luke 
(16:15). 
254 

HOLY 
All 
Creation 
is Holy, 
born 
of the Divine 
expression. 
Tha
t which 
is Holy 
is projected 
(as opposed 
to 
that which 
is emanated) from the Divine. 
HOLY MONAD, HOLY MONADIC SELF 
The Holy Monadic Self is thought of as one of 
countless myriads of 'cells' within the Multiplicity of 
Absolute Beingness - God. 
HOLY SPIRIT 
The Holy Spirit is the impersonal Super­
Consciousness that expresses the power of Absolute 
Beingness and makes possible the Creation of the 
universes. It is the dynamic aspect of the Absolute. 
IDEA, DIVINE 
See under 'Causes, Ideas and Principles' 
INNER SELF 
Inner Self is a term indicating the Self in its 
expressions above the present-day personality. 
255 

KARMA 
See under Cause & Effect, Law of 
LOOKING WITHIN 
This is the process of Introspection or self­
examination, of 'knowing thyself'. This is the core practice 
of every Researcher of Truth and all those interested in Self 
Realization. 
MIND 
The Mind is a Divine emanation of Absolute 
Beingness to which all Existences owe their construction. 
Imbued with the Divine Wisdom, Love, Power and Purity 
of its Creator, Mind is not an immortal Being, but is 
eternally used as the substance of all Creation. Mind is 
Divine at its source, and Holy in its expression. 
NOETIC STATE 
This is a state of Ideas and unexpressed forms 
beyond the worlds of separation. This state is where we 
256 

come to rest in between incarnations and where the 
Archangels derive the forms into which to breathe life. 
NOETICAL IMAGE 
A multi-dimensional image of Noetical or Psycho­
Noetical substance, fanned by thought by means ofNoetic 
light. Once formed it is everlasting, as are all Elementals. 
NOETICAL WORLDS, BODY 
The five dimensional worlds and the most rarefied 
of the three worlds of separation. In the Noetical World 
(home of the Noetical Body), the Total Wisdom of 
Absolute Beingness first finds expression as form, ranging 
from universes and galaxies to unicellular organisms. Time 
and place are attributes of the Noetical World, but not in 
the sense understood in the psychic and material worlds. 
OVER LORDSHIP 
257 

In rnrying degrees, we find over lordship as in a 
sense of dominion and Divine Authority as ordained from 
abO\-e. 
PERMANENT ATOM 
That part of the Permanent Personality, which acts 
as the recorder of the experiences, it has received in the 
place-time worlds. The Permanent Atom is situated in the 
etheric heart of each body simultaneously, and registers all 
the emotions, thoughts, reactions and experiences as they 
occur in the three worlds of Existence. 
PERMANENT PERSONALITY 
The Permanent Personality is the active and 
expressive part of Soul in Self-awareness within the worlds 
of separation, which filters knowledge (from the present­
day personalities) and distils Wisdom. 
PRESENT, PRESENT-DAY, TEMPORARY 
PERSONALITY 
A personality developed during each incarnation, 
whom we call 'George or Mary' or whatever. The present-
258 

day 
pers
onality is a 
projection 
of the 
Permanent 
Personality 
into the worlds 
of separation. 
PSYCHIC/PSYCHICAL 
WORLDS, 
BODY 
The Psychical Worlds is the four dimensional 
world, 
also known as the 'World of emotions'. 
The super­
sensuous 
psychic World is composed 
of seven planes, each 
having seven sub-planes. 
It is to the psychic \'{'orld that we 
travel in first Exosomatosis, 
in our Psychical 
Body, and to 
which, on passing o,-er, we first return. 
PSYCHO-NOETICAL 
The relationship 
between the psychic \'forld 
(emotions) 
and the Noetical \\"orld (thoughts) 
is often so 
intimate and interwoven 
that we need to consider them as 
semi-unified. 
In a thought there is often emotion, and in 
every emotion 
there is a measure of thought. 
REPENTANCE 
The Greek word for repentance 
is metanoia, which 
signifies primarily 
a change of 'mind' or 'change of 
intellect': 
not onl
y 
sorrow, contrition 
or regret, but also 
more positively 
and fundamentally 
the com·ersion 
or 
259 

turning of our whole life towards alignment with Absolute 
Beingness' Divine Plan. Also see 'Faith' as described above. 
SELF-AWARENESS, SELF-AWARE, SELF­
CONSCIOUS 
This is conscious awareness, in varying degrees, of 
the Self within the Divine Plan. 
SELFHOOD 
The Personaliry as a unified, Divine, Being. Selfhood 
encompasses all the expression of the Self from Its apex as 
the Holy Monadic Spirit-Ego-Being filtered down to the 
petty present day personality. Within the Selfhood not a 
single expression is devalued; each is cherished in its own 
right. Our Spirit-Ego-Being partakes in the Will-Pleasure of 
Absolute Beingness (to express Itself in Itself) by 
expressing Itself within its own Selfhood. We mirror God's 
Good Creation within our own good creation, within our 
Selfhood. 
SELF-REALIZATION 
Self-Realization of the Permanent Personality as 
Individuated Beingness. This is the culmination of the 
260 

gat
hering 
of 
experi
ence 
in the worlds 
of sep
aratio
n. At 
the 
poin
t of 
Self-Re
alization, 
the Permanen
t 
Perso
nality 
reuni
fied 
with 
Self-aware 
Soul 
is prepared 
to 
assimil
ate with 
the Spirit-Ego-Being in Theosis. 
SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
Self-Sufficiency is the primary Nature of Absolute 
Beingness, in complete Abundance, Blessedness and 
independence of all needs. 
SEPARATION, WORLDS OF EXISTENCE 
This phrase covers the three worlds of Existence 
(material, psychic and Noetical) in which our personality 
spends periods of seeming separation from the Spirit states 
of At-One-Ment and Beingness 
SOUL 
A Soul is formed when a ray of a Holy Monad 
passes through the Idea of Heavenly Man. The Soul is not 
created; it is a small pearl from the Spirit, which comes to 
be known as the Self-aware Soul. The Soul is in a formless 
state as Spirit, and remains formless. When returning to the 
261 

Godhead, marries the Spirit-Ego-Being, it has become 
fuller. 
SPIRIT-EGO-BEING 
Our Self in its full divinity; it is eternal and 
unmo.-able. Our Spirit-Ego-Being is the Self as Holy 
:\fonad; in total At-One-Ment with the Self-Sufficiency and 
Multiplicity of the Godhead. The Will-pleasure of Absolute 
Beingness to express Itself within Itself is identical with the 
Will of our Spirit-Ego-Being to express Itself in Its own 
Selfhood. 
SUB-CONSCIOUS, SUB-CONSCIOUSNESS 
Researchers of the Truth understand the triadic 
nature of Sub-Consciousness. One chamber of the Sub­
Conscious contains all the Elementals composing our 
personality. A second chamber is the storehouse of Etheric 
Vitality (sometimes called our 'animal vitality') The third 
and most valued chamber is that of the Logos and Holy 
Spirit, for it is through the Sub-Conscious that the Holy 
Spirit and the Logos impart Total Wisdom, Total Power 
and Total Love. 
262 

SUPER-CONSCIOUSNESS 
Super-consciousness is total awareness in Beingness. 
SYSTEM FOR THE RESEARCH OF TRUTH 
Our system of Esoteric  Christianity celebrates the 
eternal  truths known to all great religious traditions, while 
firmly based in the teachings of the God-Man Jesus Christ 
and the New Testament. Through directed study, exercises 
and meditations, we seek the balanced evolution and 
integration of our entire being. Our approach is 
methodical, safe and self-evident. 
TETRAK'IYS 
(Pronounced tet-ruk-TEES) Is a group of four. The 
elements of Earth, air, fire and water compose a tetraktys. 
THEOS IS 
At-One-Ment with the One God, Absolute 
Beingness. 
TOTAL LOVE, WISDOM and POWER 
263 

These are the Primary Natures of Absolute 
Beingness and Beings. Forming a sacred triangle each 
Nature is dependent on the other to be expressed properly. 
WILL-PLEASURE 
The Greek word 'euareskeia' has no exact equivalent 
in English. It carries a sense of pleasure derived from 
bountiful giving, as practiced by a warmly generous and 
wealthy source. Will-Pleasure was used in preference to 
'bounty' or 'charity' to avoid misconceptions. We have 
described euareskeia as 'God's pleasure in creativeness'.
