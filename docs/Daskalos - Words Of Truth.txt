WORDS OF TRUTH 
Extracts from Lectures of 
Dr.  Stylianos Atteshlis (known as  Daskalos) 
selected by 
Panayiota Theotoki-Atteshli 



I have been repeatedly asked to publish some of my father's lectures in 
a  book. Many students told  me  that such a  book would help them to 
get acquainted with the special terms and definitions of the teaching. I 
have therefore selected extracts of a number of lectures that my  father 
had given in the  Stoa, some in the seventies in  Greek and some in  the 
nineties in English. 
In-the published texts we have tried to keep as much as possible to 
the style and diction of my father. Some ideas will unavoidably be repea­
ted in the lectures but  I am sure that the reader will benefit by having 
certain ideas explained from different points of view. 
The reader may find in  the  texts of  the  lectures contradictory or 
illogical statements. But  I wish to point out that the famous Swiss psy­
chiatrist C.G. Jung wrote that the paradox was one of our most valuable 
spiritual possessions because only the paradox comes anywhere near to 
comprehend the fullness of  life.  Non-ambiguity and  non-contradiction 
are one-sided, ana thus, not suited to express the incomprehensible. 
I wish to express my gratitude to Rudolf and Eliane Stauch 'for their 
help in the preparation of this book and to  Dominik Stauch for the pro­
fessional layout. 
Finally,  I   should like to  quote from one of my  father's lectures and 
would ask the reader to take due note. "Of course I  cannot explain it to 
you, you have to do it  and get  the knowledge directly yourselves. Das­
kaloi or  Masters or  Gurus or Avatars, call them whatever you  like, can 
show you the way. But you have to walk yourself!"

CHAPTER I 
Total Wisdom, Will-pleasure, Life-Light, Archangels, Angels, 
Observation, Love, Mind, Mind Vitality, Egoism 
We said that the Absolute Infinite Be-ness (which we  comprehend as 
God) is in Its Self-Sufficiency. It is in need of nothing. The exact nature 
of  Its Self-Sufficiency is incomprehensible. In the Absolute Infinite Be­
ness there is  also Its  Total Wisdom (not yet manifested), Its Almighti­
ness and Its Will-pleasure to  manifest Itself in  Itself. This Absolute In­
finite Be-ness, this Absolute Infinite Reality,  is  in  Its  Omnipresence. 
There is  no  sense of  place or  space, or  anything, in  which there is not 
the Absolute Infinite Be-ness. 
When the Absolute Infinite Be-ness manifests in  Itself the Will­
pleasure to  manifest Itself in  Itself, the worlds of existence are created. 
What are the means by which the universes can be created? 
The first manifestation of  Total Wisdom is  the emanation of  Mind 
from the Absolute Infinite Be-ness and from all  the Beings who are co­
vibrating with the Absolute Infinite Be-ness. Now we have the Mind as 
the means by which the Total Wisdom of the Absolute Infinite Beingness 
(now Beingness, beca�se it is the manifestation of the Will-pleasure of 
Be-ness) is manifesting in  creating Its  universes. How many? Who can 
know? All we  can know as human beings - even when we develop our 
divine nature - are the worlds of existence. 
The Absolute Infinite Be-ness is in Its Plurality.  In It there are billions 
beyond numbers of  Beings. The "wise ones" have told us that for centur­
ies.  What are Beings? A  Being is something that always was, is now, and 
always will be in all eternity. So  we distinguish between the word "being" 
and the word "existing". Now, these Beings are Gods, but let us have this 
straight: There is  only one God, the Father, but in  that Father God are 
many Gods similar to  It, composing Its Totality,  Its Plurality. 
Now we see these Beings co-vibrating with the Will-pleasure of 
God. For manifestation? Not all of them . Why then do  some co-vibrate 
12 

and others do not co-vibrate? Perhaps this is in what we call the divine 
Plan. 
Now  we have  the Will-pleasure of the Absolute Infinite Be-ness, 
which appears, manifested as the Absolute Infinite Beingness. The Ab­
solute Infinite Beingness manifests Its Will-pleasure, and the holy Arch­
angels co-vibrate and emanate Mind Supersubstance. 
We  can compare this Will-pleasure of manifestation with Light. It 
is Light, Life is Light. Unless there was Light, divine Light, and all the 
manifestations of  Light, there  would be  no life  manifested. Life  and 
Light: the two words are synonyms. 
So, we have the light, but the light has no colour yet. Actually, we 
cannot see the light itself, or the colours in the light.  But if the light 
passes through a prism, the light will break up into red light, violet light, 
blue  light,  green light,  yellow light;  and now you can see the  light as 
colours. 
The divine Light is the nature of these Beings in the Absolute Infin­
ite Beingness. We said that light was colourless; but now these Beings 
present-their own  colours. This classifies these Beings in  their Arch­
angelic orders. Why? How? Nobody knows; they don't even know the 
answer themselves. When I asked them, "What makes you  a  Michael 
and  you  a  Raphael?" They  said,  "Why do  you  see  these differences 
among us?" They  cannot see any differences amongst themselves, but 
we can see them from our human point of view. So the Archangels class­
ify themselves in their Archangelic orders. Each order performs its own 
work perfectly, and they  combine and  cooperate in order to  create the 
universes. In the noetic and Supernoetic worlds you cannot distinguish 
a Michael from a Raphael. There, they are all the same, similar, colour­
less white. It is only later that they  get their colour. 
What is  the  relationship between colour and  spund? Colour is 
classified into  seven  basic hues  (seven  rates of vibration) and sound is 
classified into scales of  seven tones  (also different rates of  vibration). 
The holy Archangels express their own light and they create their own 
sounds. These sounds blended together create the universes. Archangels 
don't have hands to create; they use their vibrat_ions. The sounds and the 
colours of the light are the means by which the holy Archangels create: 
first they get their name from the sound which they make and which we 
can hear, and then they use sound and light to create the universes. 
We  have said that we classify the Archangels as far as we huma� 
beings can understand. Any description is necessarily poor and incomp-
Words of Truth  I  Chapter 1

lete. You can only understand these truths if you live in them. Develop 
your consciousness and your personality to higher and higher levels un­
til you come in touch with these Archangelic orders; they can teach you 
a lot and they are willing to convey their wisdom to human beings who 
start becoming like themselves. In fact, we are similar to the Archangels. 
The Archangels cannot see in human beings how sinful or wicked that 
personality is. They look for the good and see in that personality some­
thing, w_hich is similar to them, i.e. the Soul-Spirit. I can tell you from 
my own experience that Archangels are not Souls; they do not express, 
what we call, a Soul, but they do express an Ego. An Ego means a kind 
of individuality, expressing its own nature. They have their Archangelic 
Egos and these Egos have never been separated from the Absolute In­
finite Beingness. They have never left what we call the One-ness. 
What is the difference between a human Ego and the Ego of  the 
Archangels? The human Ego has  become a Soul and has  entered the 
world of separateness. The Archangels have never done so. Human be­
ings are  Spirit-Soul-Egos while the holy Archangels are simply Spirit­
Egos, not expressing Souls. The difference between the various Arch­
angelic orders is difficult to  explain. It  is  less  a kind of  separateness, 
but rather a kind of quality that  qualifies the Archangels to be part of 
a certain Archangelic order. Can the Archangels switch from one order 
to another  order? Yes, for as long as they wish; but then they return to 
their own Archangelic nature. This means that they have within them­
selves what we call "at-one-ment." This is something we cannot properly 
understand: They can be in at-one-ment and at the same time in their 
own nature. I cannot understand it but I am sure that it is a fact. Why 
can't I understand it, although I can get in   touch with the Archangels? Be­
cause I am also in the �orld of separateness, being a Soul, a human Ego. 
Are the Archangels wiser than we are? Yes,  they are. All the Arch­
angelic  orders are,  because they perform their work according to their 
nature,  having before them the  divine Plan. They perform their tasks 
perfectly, and in perfect cooperation amongst themselves. They are most 
wise in their work, creating the universes. The universes are ruled by 
the Total  Wisdom, by  the Absolute Infinite Beingness, the  Logos, the 
manifestation or expression of the Total Wisdom and the Almightiness 
of the Infinite Reality. 
Our nature as Spirit-Ego and the Archangels' nature as Spirit-Ego is 
observation. It is difficult to express what I really mean by observation. 
We  could call it perfect concentration and at the same time knowing, 
14 

but we don't have the right word for it.  Let us therefore call it  observa­
tion; our nature and their nature is what we call observation. As human 
beings we have observation in  our  nature, but  we  have to  express it, 
and we can only express it when we develop in ourselves our  Inner Real 
nature. This is why we as human beings do not understand what perfect 
observation is.  The Archangels know it,  they use perfect observation to 
produce and  present the  Total  Wisdom - without mistakes. The  holy 
Archangels never make mistakes in their work because this is  their real 
nature. I  have to  repeat that  words are  not  adequate to express these 
conditions of life, especially concerning the Archangels. 
The Archangels are creating elementals in the same way  we create 
our elementals. But the elementals of the holy Archangels are perfect, 
creative, without fault. The elementals of the holy Archangels, of  these 
Super-Intelligences, are what we call the angels and nature spirits. 
The nature spirits are  most wise. We  can  see  this  in  their mani­
festation in the phenomena of  life,  which they supervise and  in  which 
they live.  Every phenomenon of life,  from the vegetable kingdom to the 
mineral-kingdom, e.g. every metal in the earth, every crystal in the rock, 
every phenomenon of life has in it its supervising nature spirit, which is 
most wise - most wise in itself and most wise in manifesting the wisdom 
of  the  ruling Super-Intelligence. Is  this  Super-Intelligence one  of  the 
Archangelic orders? Who knows? But we know that its manifestation in 
the vegetable and even in the animal kingdom is perfect and most wise. 
We  have said  that  we  must exercise our divine nature of  observa­
tion, using the mind as right thinking to distinguish and understand this 
Total  Wisdom. We  will  find  out  that even in the  gross material world, 
the world we live in - in the lowest manifestation of life - there is Total 
Wisdom. I said  that  we  must use  observation because l feel  that  we 
should be able to  see these things. When you develop, your conscious­
ness to higher levels, especially to  self-consciousness, you can come in 
touch with the elementals of the Archangels, i.e. angels and nature spir­
its.  But then you  will also be able to see your own elementals. You can 
appreciate your human-angels, i.e.  your good elementals. Then you can 
also  control and  even de-materialize human-demons, i.e.  bad  elemen­
tals, 
in yourself and in others. This needs much work and training, while 
constantly manifesting perfect concentration and observation. Observe 
everything. Nothing should escape your attention and  nothing should 
be put aside before you have exhausted your thoughts in understanding 
what is and exists around you.

These angels and nature spirits use their Total Wisdom in the veg­
etable kingdom as sensitivity,  and in the animal kingdom as sensibility 
·and instinct. How can we observe this Total Wisdom? ln the vegetable 
kingdom by studying and observing how the plants and trees grow, bloom 
and propagate. Why does a rose bush have thorns? To prevent animals 
from eating and destroying it. Study the beauty of cacti with their many 
thorns. Every cactus has its own structure of protective thorns . 
. Do  the  nature spirits enjoy their way  of  living, ruled by  sensitiv­
ity,  sensibility and  instinct? They must. Can  we  human beings come 
in touch with nature spirits and  understand how  intelligent they  are? 
Yes,  when we  develop in  ourselves our  self-consciousness we  can  get 
in touch with nature spirits provided we can first get in touch with the 
ruling Archangel and angel. Do  they understand us?  Is  a nature spirit 
(often called gnome or fairy) intelligent enough to understand us? The 
answer is yes. They are  intelligent enough to understand us.  Both the 
nature spirits and the angels in the vegetable and animal kingdoms are 
very wise. If you love them, they will love you. 
At one time I had about 300 kinds of cacti. I loved them and I could 
communicate with them. Their nature spirits were willing to communi­
cate, they  enjoyed my love for them and  returned my  love.  Now, there 
was  a  kind  of  cactus, a  very  sensitive cactus, with small thorns. But if 
something, let  us  say  a  hand, touched the  thorns they  would immedi­
ately pierce the hand, form hooks and release a poison. I had raised one 
of those cacti from seed; so I knew it. Then one day I saw quite a large 
example of those cacti at a garden shop. The owner of the shop warned 
me, not to touch that cactus, explaining what would happen. But I took 
it in my hand and _caressed it. The shop owner almost fainted but nothing 
happened. I laughed and said, "I love the cactus, and the cactus loves me. 
As I approached the cactus and as it began to protect itself, I started to 
communicate with it in my mind. I told it not to be afraid because I loved 
it. And the cactus obeyed." The shop owner looked at me with suspicion 
and said that now he understood why many people called me a Magus. 
I explained that human beings nowadays do not love nature and so 
nature does not love them. If you love nature, nature will love you. Try 
to understand and enjoy nature. 
Love? What is  love? On  the  level of  the  gross material world, do 
people  love  the phenomena of life  on the  lower levels, e.g. the mineral 
kingdom? Yes, people say that they love diamonds and  precious stones. 
They like to possess them. But what do they really know of these things? 
16 

Do 
they know what it means to love the minerals? They know nothing. 
In the animal kingdom, can the elementals of animals - expressing 
their way of life as instinct - manifest love for a human being? Yes, of 
course, nature is ready to love human beings if the human beings love 
nature. But if our vibrations, even subconscious vibrations, are hostile 
to  animals then they  will try  to protect  themselves. Many  people are 
constantly trying to  destroy  phenomena of life.  Why?  Because many 
human beings have not developed much beyond the animal instinct of 
their material body. 
We said that  all  the phenomena of life  around us in the animal 
kingdom of the gross material world use the Mind in order to express in 
their way of life what we call instinct. In all these phenomena of life the 
nature spirits and the angels are in them and behind them expressing 
Mind as instinct. 
How can we understand that?  Let  us have  a look at  our human 
bodies. They have this instinct, i.e. our human bodies are living instinc­
tively. There is nothing in the human body that is beyond instinct. So, 
our human material bodies and all the bodies of the animal kingdom are 
governed by instinct. And by what or by whom is the instinct governed? 
By the holy Archangels who are creating and sustaining the gross mate­
rial bodies. Of course, our human material bodies are under the orders 
of the holy Archangels of the elements who created them and maintain 
them. They look after the blood circulation and the various organs. 
We said that the life of our material body is different from our life 
as petty time-and-place personality. True, we are living in. that material 
body, yet most human beings know not much about the body. We must 
come to understand it by  studying anatomy. We will wonder how well 
this body  is built and how well all the organs cooperate allowirrg us to 
live in good health. 
By observation, by study, by using Mind properly we can know the 
truth concerning the creation of our human bodies.  If we practise ob­
servation and study,  if we concentrate and enter our inner  Selves,  we 
will, in the course of time, find ourselves in conscious contact with the 
Archangels who are working in our bodies. 
Are the holy Archangels hostile to us and can they be our enemies? 
No. The holy  Archangels of creation know nothing except love. They 
love all the human beings whether they are good or wicked. They work 
in accordance with their nature in the divine  Plan.  They  do not us� 
Mind to reason or to influence our life. 
Words of Truth  I  Chapter 1

Example: If  a  holy man and a  criminal fight and inflict wounds on 
each other, the holy Archangels will heal the wounds and mend the bro­
ken bones of both of them, irrespective of their personality. The saint will 
be healed in the same way as the criminal. From the point of view of the 
holy Archangels there is no preference, because they know only how to 
love and how to work in creating and sustaining the material bodies. They 
love to see a child grow, they love to see man grow to their measure. 
The Archangels in  our  bodies have feelings and emotions, but  not 
the way humans have feelings and emotions. They are different in qual­
ity.  Do they hate? No. Love? Yes, but in a way not easily understood by 
human beings who almost always harbour feelings of  hatred and com­
plaint in their heart. 
I had much difficulty to be able to attune myself to  their feeling of 
love, because it was only  with  much  effort  that I could  make  sure that I 
had not the least complaint against anybody in myself. 
Do  the  Archangels avoid us  as  human beings, as  petty time-and­
place personalities with the heavily wrapped personal self with the veils 
of  darkness we  call egoism? They don't want to  see  that, they avoid 
that; but they are in constant contact with our Souls and with our Spir­
it.  If you want to contact the Archangels you must develop in  yourself 
your consciousness to  the  level of  Self-consciousness (and later Self­
Superconsciousness) and in this the Archangels rejoice, and they come 
to your help. 
Why do these Archangels keep themselves far from the petty person­
ality of the human being today? Because most humans now are such ego­
ists and so stupid to think that they must dominate everything, even God 
and the Archangels. They go in a church, light a candle and think they are 
pious, good people. Yet  they have the  tendency of wanting to  have, get­
ting, seizing, catching and dominating. This is what places human beings 
in the world of separateness. To them everything turns around their petty 
(stupid) little time-and-place personality.  Why  is  it  of  so  much impor­
tance to the human beings? Is it important to nature or to
.
God? 
The duty of the seekers of truth is to find the truth concerning life, 
and concerning their own life; to  find out  who they are  and how they 
should behave in  nature, in  the  lowest state of  nature. They have to 
prove themselves worthy to be given more, to live consciously and then 
Self-consciously in higher realms in the worlds of existence of nature. 
We  have said that by  observation and studying the  phenomena of 
life  of  the  mineral, the  vegetable and the  animal kingdoms all  around 
18 

y
ou,  you  will  see  the  Total  Wisdom as  sensitivity, sensibility and  in­
stinct. Mind is  only  manifested as  sensitivity, sensibility and  instinct, 
in no other way. These phenomena of life cannot develop what we call 
conscious thinking. They do not express a self.  For example, no cow and 
no dog will ever say, "I am". The 1-ness is what we call the Selfhood and 
this 1-ness, the Ego is God. We are placing the I-ness of the human be­
ings and the I-ness of the Archangels in the "Beingness", for we are all 
beings, human beings and Archangelic beings, Gods. 
The animals all around us are existing entities; they  are not beings; 
they  are not Souls. We can see the  difference in the way  they  are liv­
ing. Their life is instinctive and nothing else.  Even in its Total Wisdom, 
instinct is instinct. But to the human beings Total  Wisdom affords the 
freedom to use Mind in the right or in the wrong way. No animal can use 
Mind in the right or wrong way. 
The difference between us human beings and the holy Archangels, 
our  brethren, is  the  use  of  Mind. We human beings can  use  Mind in 
the right or wrong way; very  often we use it in the wrong way.  The holy 
Archangels, on the other hand, use  Mind, which emanates from them, 
always in the right way.  They use it in creating, sustaining and  loving, 
expressing love. 
Another difference is the source of Mind. We borrow Mind, we are 
granted Mind by  God, to be used by  us as thinking personalities. Mind 
does not emanate from our personalities. The holy  Archangels, on the 
other hand, emanate Mind themselves. However, when a human being 
reaches the highest levels of his own nature, controlling and ruling his 
instinct,  knowing his subconsciousness and having cleaned his person­
ality, having gained con.sciousness and Self-consciousness, then he can 
as a human being emanate Mind. 
' 
Yes,  Mind can emanate from a human being, but not before he  or 
she has reached that high level. Before we have reached that level we 
have to ask for Mind, and it will be granted to us as our daily  bread. 
Now, we  see  the  Archangels using Mind Supersubstance, which 
emanates from them, in creating the universes and all the phenomena 
of  life  most wisely. We  see  the  human being, a  petty time-and-place 
p
ersonality, wrapped in the veils of darkness of its own human-demons, 
its elementals. What are the elementals? 
Absolute Infinite Be{ngness, in  Its  Mercy, is  granting us  a  certain 
amount of  Mind Supersubstance every day,  and every moment, so that 
we -Spirit-Soul-Selves - may  live as petty personalities in the world of 
Words of Truth  I  Chapter I 
19 

existence. The amount of Mind, which we receive amounts in 24 hours 
to a certain maximum quantity.  Let us say that this quantity is I 00 units. 
We need 40 units for the holy Archangels to use in creating and sustain­
ing our bodies. We need another 40 units as means of living.  For every­
thing we do, thinking, moving, going here and there, we have to expend 
Mind vitality, more or less according to the way we live. 20 units are left 
to us,  to be used in any way we like. This is the Mercy of God for the 
present-day time-and-place human being. 
How do human beings conduct their lives nowadays in our society, here 
and all overtheworld?Theyexhaust the Mind vitality that is given to them by 
the way they are living. How do they exhaust the Mind vitality? While living 
their lives they keep in themselves the" devils" which devour Mind vitality. 
These "devils" are human elementals, which need this  energy to live. 
By harbouring hatred against others, despising others, and having com­
plaints about  others we keep  the  elementals alive.  Also being jealous 
and 
searching for revenge are emotion-thoughts that are exhausting the 
Mind vitality. If circumstances in  our  way of life are leading to  vices, 
anger, fighting etc. we destroy much of our Mind Supersubstance. · 
Study yourself. How much of your Mind Supersubstance is wasted? 
Observe your environment. When you see a fellow who is very angry 
and shouting with rage, look how his face turns red. After such a seizure 
of anger the man is feeling exhausted. You can observe and witness how 
the etheric Mind vitality is burning down. This is energy, which we need 
to live and properly express ourselves. 
Is there any punishment for transgressing the laws of nature, pun­
ishment from  God or the Archangels? No. The holy Archangels try to 
repair and restore health even after we have damaged ourselves through 
anger or other negative elementals. Then is there someone else to pun­
ish us for our transgressions? Yes, we ourselves. By our behaviour we get 
the reward due to us, according to our behaviour. So, we must know that 
all these elementals we have within us are the cause of our illnesses. We 
are responsible for them; the Archangels are always trying to remedy our 
illnesses and our conditions, but we don't cooperate with them.  If we 
are ill,   it is our own fault.  Is the fault from the present or is it Karma? It 
may also be Karma, but even then,  why should we be under the burden 
of these circumstances and not come to reason and by observation and 
right thinking find the cause of the illness and remedy the condition? 
Joshua the Christ taught us all of that; he taught the whole world, 
not only his disciples. The illnesses are the result of our transgressions. 
20 

This is proved by what Christ did and said.  Before he healed someone 
he said to them,  " ... your sins are forgiven." Unless sins and transgres­
sions are forgiven, healing is not possible to take place. Unless a man 
repents and changes his mind, he should not expect a miracle, because 
he still has the sin in his mind. That is why we promise nothing and dis­
close nothing in our healing work, because the person seeking a healing 
should cooperate. 
Of course, we are not Christ who has the authority to forgive sins, 
but we can teach the people around us to see the things as they are and 
to use  their  minds properly as right  thinking; to see things and change 
them. 
The  church knows all  these  things; the  first  church fathers have 
taught what we call repentance. Why? Because unless we repent we will 
not gain the necessary change or recovery. 
Repentance is a word that has come from the church; do we have a 
scientific word for it? Not everybody likes the religious terminology. Yes, 
we have a w_9rd,  which even scientists accept: self-analysis. In repent­
ance we study our behaviour and our deeds and come to an understand­
ing of what is what, what is positive and what is negative and then we 
decide to change. In self-analysis we have the same process, so let us 
call it self-analysis. 
What a confessor is doing to  help people, a good psychotherapist 
can also do, by using self-analysis of the person. He can also teach peo­
ple the right way to live and think. 
Now science and religion are joining hands - repentance is scien­
tific.  Reptntance or self-analysis is a necessity for  any  personality to 
achieve its purpose in life. A good psychiatrist, a good psychotherapi�t, 
a good confessor, they all should do the same thing. A good psychothera­
pist should be a scientist and a good confessor should also be a scientist. 
For they have to deal with a Soul-personality. There can never be a per­
sonality, man or woman, expr.essing a self as a personality, unless part of 
this personality is the Soul. 
During the time of Joshua Immanuel they divided the concept of 
the Soul in two states: the perfect and the sinning; and they said, "The 
Soul, which is sinning will die," which means that it will change. 
So we must  know that in  every human being, in his  or  her  time­
and-place present-day ego-self as a personality - wrapped in the veils 
of darkness and ruled by the human-demon-elementals - the part in it 
that is life is the Soul. What should we do with the part that they called 
Words of Truth I Chapter I 
21 

"sinning" or evil? Should we kill it or destroy it, should it die? No. We 
have to transmute it into its own nature. The  concept of death or annihi­
lation was not properly understood. A human being, a  man or a  woman, 
even the most wicked personality has in itself the Soul-essence, and this 
Soul-essence has to purify sooner or later the whole personality of man. 
Joshua said, "the mortal will become immortal", because its nature is 
immortality, and "the changing will become permanent." This is what is 
meant by the sayings of our Lord, Joshua the Christ. 
Now, in conclusion: The holy Archangels are using the Mind vitality, 
transmuting it into Mind etheric energy and even into matter, to build 
our bodies and to manifest and express their Total Wisdom and their 
Almightiness. It is for us to study it, to live in it, to live in the material 
world. No one can doubt that the Total Wisdom is ruling the worlds. 
We should understand and find our place in what we call life, be­
cause we are the life as Spirit-Soul-Ego-Selves; and we should see and 
study our duality in the worlds of existence. 
We should stop obeying the time-and-place human-demon, which 
presents itself as our 1-ness. It may present itself as an "angel of light", 
for nobody admits that he or she is not good, even though they may be 
worse than beasts. Instead we must gain control to find ourselves. Find 
out who we are, who can use Mind vitality, and who is misusing Mind 
vitality. First, we must understand what Mind vitality is. Observe how 
it is used as thoughts, in thinking, as emotions and desires. Then we 
must study how we are using this Mind vitality, what we are doing as 
time-and-place personalities. Are we acting as slaves of desires and un­
controlled emotions, creating in our subconsciousness that part of our 
personality that is a dirty, muddy pool consisting of our weaknesses, pas­
sions, our hatred and our enmity, which separate us from the One-ness 
of the Absolute Infinite Beingness. 
I am very serious when I  say that we must separate ourselves from 
the shadow,  which is not ourselves. I  have said that I  place much im­
portance on Introspection, looking within, and on self-analysis. Joshua 
Immanuel said, "entering in the kingdom of the heavens ... "  which is in 
us, in our Spirit-Soul-Ego-Self. There are no excuses; many saints and 
wise men have revealed this truth, at least partly, the relative truth. 
God had directly been humanized, entering the material world with­
out leaving the One-ness of God. He testified to and proved the Truth. 
Everything necessary for us to live in the gross material world has been 
provided. By observing nature around us we see that it is a  paradise. We, 
22 

the people on earth, have made it into a  hell, or rather we have created 
and built in and around us our shell-hell. Everything that is created, 
and everything that has been and will be created, according to the Total 
Wisdom of God is good. So, we must acknowledge this great truth by 
observation and right  thinking and find our place in this world, even as 
time-and-place petty personality. We must become a  reasonable entity 
and not waste and make bad use of the divine gift, which is Mind, the 
essence of thinking, of thought and of emotion. Checking, observing, 
understanding and later deciding and being able to control a  situation, 
that is the great gain. "I am I'", a  son of God and Spirit of God. We sepa­
rate ourselves now from the time-and-place petty personality with its 
ruling demon, human-demon, the personality's egoism. 
We have to crucify the egoism of our personality, and I use the words 
of our Beloved Joshua Immanuel" ... unless you shoulder your cross and 
follow me ... "  (why? to be crucified). Unless you crucify the time-and­
place evil egoism, don't expect your own self, your real Ego-Soul, to be 
resurrected. _This is the first crucifixion that is most necessary. 
In our Symbol of Life it is just above the emotional, towards the 
heart; it is the first cross that you see. 
Once again, the words of the most Beloved One: "He who wants to 
follow me, let him shoulder his cross and follow." There is great meaning 
in this.

CHAPTER 2 
Mind, Ethers, Concentration, Observation, Meditation, Visualization 
First of all, what is concentration? What is meditation? What is observa­
tion? Many have asked me to give them the "keys". These are the "keys". 
The difficulty is not to tell them what the "keys" are, but how to use the 
keys. To sit and work. 
Everything is Mind.  Whatever you deal with is made of Mind. You 
should realize what Mind is, Mind as Supersubstance, Mind as sub­
stance, as super-matter, and Mind as matter. 
Now, what do we have? We have our material body which is matter 
(Mind solid). We are living in this material body and we are also using 
the material brain - which is a  kind of battery. But, of course, we don't 
always need a battery ... 
Now, we have to work in the material body. That means,  living in 
the material body in what we call the "waking consciousness" - we have 
to use the Mind. We said that we would not work on the material brain 
because that is matter, nothing more than matter -batteries that are 
not charged are nothing.  We have to work on what we call the etheric 
double of the material body. We classify the etheric body into categories 
of ether. Creative ether is under the authority of the Archangels and the 
Holy Spirit. We have imprinting ether which is used to form psycho­
noetical images. Then we have the kinetic ether and the aesthetic ether; 
these two go together. Now, of course, even the imprinting ether is kin­
esis: motion in time. We shall come to that later from another point of 
view. 
We have to deal with our waking consciousness; with at least these 
three forms of Mind: imprinting, aesthetic and kinetic ether. How do 
we do this? We see that everybody is subconsciously using the imprint­
ing Mind. From the moment one is born he starts to be subject to the 
vibrations of the emotions of his psychical body. He observes things. 
24 

his  attention is  being drawn to  things, and he  starts putting them (as 
elementals) in  his  subconsciousness. This is the  natural way of  acting 
and reacting in the life on the  material plane. For him it is not difficult 
(to recollect) to have these elementals on the surface again - rather the 
opposite, it is difficult to stop them from coming to the surface. 
So we see that everybody is using Mind as imprinting ether, subcon­
sciously. And already his subconsciousness is full of  forms, elementals: 
every elemental created by the way he  was living, his interests, his de­
sires, and his emotions. Both good and bad. They are there. All elemen­
tals have a form, all have colour and size. We shall come to this later. 
Now we have observed that everybody - without consciously caring 
about Mind - uses Mind subconsciously by living "just like that". That 
is  why we  could say that they are living subconsciously.  But  we should 
learn to  deal with Mind consciously.  That means, we have to learn how 
to fix our attention for a fixed period of time, without interference of any 
other emotional condition in us.  Jn this way we  will get  the training to 
control the �ind and thought. This is the first and most important step 
- concentration. Concentration begins with the  fixing of our  attention 
and mind on something for some time, say five or ten minutes. What do 
we see? We realize that thousands of thoughts are coming to disturb and 
distract our attention. This is the difficulty. 
We  have to  practise concentration for a very, very long time, until we 
are sure that we are not being interrupted by the thoughts that come to 
the surface from the  subconsciousness. Concentration is  the most dif­
ficult thing, but it is the only means to master meditation. 
How do  we  do  that? Choose something ...  anything, there are so 
many things all around you. Relax completely and fix your attention and 
gaze at  that thing without thinking anything about it.  Simply see its 
fo
rm,  its  colour ...  no  other thought ...  don't even think what that thing 
is.  Simply see the form of it.  But fix, with patience, your gaze and  your 
attention on it.  No more than five minutes. No need to extend this per­
iod. Periods of five minutes, continually practised, will lead to  success 
so that you can start meditation. 
There is  a  big  difference between concentration and meditation. 
In meditation you need concentration. You should be sure that you can 
concentrate, or fix your attention on something. 
MEDITATION. What is meditation? The fixing of  the attention on 
an idea or concept and studying it. Meditation should be done in a 
reasonable way. For example: I would tell you: Come here. I give you a 
Words of Truth I Chapter 2 
25 

seed of corn. See it. Take it in your hand. In your hand you see it and 
concentrate: "I will meditate on that seed of corn." This means, I will 
cover its "circle of possibilities". Now, the circle of possibilities is work­
ing, which means, you have to deal with it. Get that seed. Look at it for 
two or three minutes. For two or three minutes you fo: your attention 
on it. And then close your eyes. See it now (with your eyes closed) and 
start meditating. See a place with fertile ground - start the meditation 
- throw the seed - see it - it is dropping on the ground. Then you see 
the rain coming. -You realize now that meditation and visualization go 
together. 
See the rain drops soak into the soil, covering the seed. Now, you 
see that the rain has stopped. The sun is coming out. The soil is becom­
ing warm. 
You can see more rain, if you want,  or you can think that there is 
enough humidity. In meditation you have the choice. You can speed up 
the circle of possibilities, or enjoy it by allowing it to slowly unfold. 
Then  see the seed sprouting roots:  two  small  shoots piercing the 
ground ... Rain ... the wet soil... the seed opening up ... it is growing above 
the ground. Continue to see it grow naturally and properly. Rain, the soil 
absorbing the rain, the warm sun, again some rain. 
It is a skill to deal with meditation, to do it naturally, as far as possible. 
The ears of corn emerge and develop. You now see whole fields of 
corn - but keep your attention on that  which  is yours.  See the wind 
waving the tall stalks. See them changing colour as the season changes. 
They turn yellowish. See the harvesting combine coming (nowadays you 
have a combine). If you like, you can see the reapers come. 
To see the things,. visualize things as they happen, that means med­
itation. 
And then see how the corn gives seeds - you have reached the end 
and the beginning of the cycle. You can take a seed, plant it and start 
again. This means covering the whole Circle of Possibilities regarding 
the object you are meditating on. 
We can  do a  similar meditation about a rosebush. For any living 
thing we have to cover the circle of possibilities. 
What is the value of such a meditation? You are growing accustomed 
to visualization and meditation. In time you will gain greater powers and 
it may even lead to materialization. Proper meditation and visualization 
are hard work. .. but they are the keys. It is not difficult to find the keys, 
but you need a lot of practice to learn how to use the keys. 
26 

Now,  we have learnt a  meditation method. Billions of  living forms 
are around us and invite us to study and meditate on them. Where does 
it lead you? To intuition and contemplation, which means coming sub­
consciously,  first without knowing it,  in  contact with the nature spirits, 
angels or  Archangels. You may in  time come to  know something about 
something by  intuition. 
You will have to  practise meditation  -which means concentration 
and visualization - without being disturbed by anything. But is this poss­
ible with so  many distractions and noises around? You will get accust­
omed to not being influenced by noises. 
Let us look at VISUALIZATION. Working in  visualization means deal­
ing with imprinting ether of our etheric double. In cooperation with the 
imprinting ether of  the etheric double of  our psychical body (body of 
emotion). Because we love the work, we like it, there is feeling in it. And 
when we advance we are using the formless Supersubstance of Mind. 
You may pick it up from your subconsciousness, or  from what you have 
been reading, you revitalize it;  it becomes yours, and you work with it. 
This  is  the work with imprinting ether. 
Another branch of  research is the kinetic and aesthetic ether of our 
etheric double. Kinetic ether facilitates movement, and aesthetic ether 
is  the feeling-giving ether. Fix  your attention and concentrate on the 
etheric double. Start with the kinetic ether. Feel the toes of  your right 
foot, and feel how you are moving upwards, up until you come to  the 
knee. From the knee you go further up and feel the abdomen. Then go 
down the left leg and foot. In this way we use the kinetic and aesthetic 
ether.  With practice you will get control over your etheric double. 
Now, how do we do that? Start fixing your attention - with the a�s­
thetic ether (without the kinetic ether) - on a  point. Feel it  and take 
three deep breaths inhaling and three exhaling. You can feel the beats of 
your heart as  you count. Filling the abdomen then the upper part, then 
exhaling the abdomen then the upper part. Feel a  place in  your body 
- the etheric double of  your material body. Say,  for fi':'e minutes I  will 
concentrate on my toes, or  on my right or  left foot. Fix your aesthetic 
(not kinetic) ether. You take deep breaths in  and deep breaths out, and 
feel continuously.  This is most difficult because all the time elementals 
from your subconsciousness will rise to  the surface. Keep them down! 
This is  the best thing you can do, keep them down! Be undisturbed. 
Then 
concentrate and feel a knee. After five minutes switch to the other 
knee. We have plenty of  time. Don't do it  for more than five minutes. 
Words of Truth 
I Chapter 2 
27 

Avoid feeling the heart, because you may disturb the circulation. The 
heart is the domain of the Holy Spirit, the Logos and the Archangels. In 
the lungs? Yes, concentrate in the lungs, in the navel, in the solar plexus. 
The solar plexus is the storehouse of the vital energy. 
Why do we make these exercises? To get the vital energy under our 
control. If we   can move this energy from one part of our body to another, 
we  can  also  move it  out.  Absent healers must  be  able  to  consciously 
form elementals of aesthetic and kinetic ether, feel the  elemental and 
send it to the person in need. 
We must feel it and order it to work. This is not magic. We should 
not even call it white magic. Why use the word magic? It is the work of 
the Archangels! 
If you can properly concentrate on certain parts of your body, what 
can you do with this ability in the course of time? By concentrating your 
attention on  a wound on  a foot,  for instance, you  can  pass  your hand 
and  heal  the  wound, by  controlling the etheric vitality and  by  adding 
etheric vitality, if necessary. This needs much practice, of course. What 
everybody can  do,  is  to gain  mastery over  his  or  her  own  body,  heal­
ing illnesses that come to him, relieving pain and improving his health. 
Everybody can practise this. 
By  concentrating and MEDITATING ON  YOUR  SUBCONSCIOUSNESS -
another form  of  meditation - you  can  control your  personality.  Other 
forms of meditation will lead to control of the etheric currents, to "mind 
reading" by  intuition and  contemplation. Meditation will  also  be  the 
basic exercise to attain "attunement" and "at-one-ment". But we will not 
deal with that now.

CHAPTER 3 
Truth, Life, Love 
What is Truth and how can we approach the Truth? 
I admit that this is a very difficult subject, very, very difficult. I will 
try to tell you as well as I can in simple words what I personally believe 
about this  subject. What I will say is not from  studies, it is not  from 
different books or systems of the east and west only.  Of course, I have 
studied a lot.-Books can be useful as guides, yes, nothing else.  What I 
will talk about is my own personal experience. 
What is truth? It is certainly not a question of my giving you a reli­
gious lecture, although I hold a doctorate in theology. Yet when we come 
to truth and religion, we will mention the aspect of religion. 
Although our orthodox science is still in its infancy, I acknowledge 
that  our  scientists have  made great  and  praiseworthy endeavours. All 
they have discovered is very praiseworthy, yet they have not reached any 
conclusion,, because all their efforts until  now  are  made around solid 
matter, time and space, and nothing else. 
Now, a  few  scientists begin to  move on  beyond matter and  th�y 
speak about a  certain antimatter.  The  mystics and  the  researchers of 
the truth have known this and they gave it other names. For them it is a 
reality and they work with it. _Each one of them will be able to exercise 
and use it practically. 
Now we come to the religions, all the religions of the world, through­
out  the centuries. There was  in  the beginning a  gentle, a  good, a  big 
effort. Later many who  had  a  certain power and  who  were  prepared 
to exercise their power with_.force entered the Church hierarchy. They 
tried to impose themselves in order to limit the gentle and the good ef­
fort, and above all to restrict any research. And we see the result in all 
the religions, East and West. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 3 
29 

Christianity.  Yes, the substance of  Christianity as  religion and our 
own Orthodox dogma have much depth, much truth, but who penetrates 
the depths? Almost none. 
Ancient Greek philosophy,  Egyptian philosophy, Indian philosophy 
and others, they have all very great depth. They all are w�ys to the truth. 
In the Christian religion and in other sy stems and religions we find the 
use of  myth-making. The people tried to  conceal the truth in  order to 
avoid its  exploitation by the profane. Today all  is changed. The truth is, 
and it  must be, the property of  all. Today human beings can face their 
responsibilities. Moreover science advances. We have atomic scientists 
who can destroy cities in one moment. The danger exists. 
So, the researcher of  the truth of  today,  unlike the Mystic of  the 
past, does no  longer have to  conceal great truths by  myths, out of  fear 
that someone who would penetrate into the substance of  reality could 
acquire powers that he  might exploit and make bad use of  against his 
fellowmen. And I wonder, are there not a thousand other ways or means 
to defraud your fellowmen? Weapons? 
The Truth. What  is  the Truth? Did somebody until now tell us 
something about the Truth? The much beloved Joshua said: "I  am the 
Way,  the Truth, and the Life." These are three synonyms, and he  said 
"I". And the Apostle and Evangelist John (Yiohannan) said about the 
Christ Logos that he  is "the light that gives light to all men coming into 
the world." Consequently,  this light, which is the self-awareness in each 
human being, is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. 
However, how shall we find it?  How shall we get started? And which 
truth shall we find? What is truth? 
It is not possible to.reveal the truth within the world of three dimens­
ions, within the earthly world, within the world in which we are now liv­
ing. We can comprehend the relative truth, yes, but not the Truth. Can 
we find the Truth in  the worlds of the four and the five dimensions, the 
worlds which orthodox science begins to recognize and where they study 
antimatter? 
There, in the worlds of the four and five dimensions, the researcher 
of  the truth can again find the relative truth, more brilliant, but again 
the relative truth. 
Where is the truth? What is the truth? And later the question: How 
can man approach the truth? And how will the truth be useful for man? 
Here again the much beloved Joshua the Christ spoke to us clearly: 
"And you shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you free." 
30 

From what shall the truth make us free? From what will it make us 
free? 
Are we slaves and the truth is the only means which will make us 
free? Yes, only the knowledge of the truth will make us free from our 
illusions, from our misfortune, from the dark chaos in which we move, 
from hatred, from ignorance. 
Now,  let us see of what kind of truth we can speak within the gross 
material  world,  this  world in which we now live.  If I say to ten people 
who have admired a marvellous sunset with beautiful colours or a beauti­
ful  sunrise with wonderful colours: "Is  it  the  truth  that  you  saw  this 
sunrise or this sunset?", I am sure that all of them will tell me, "Certainly 
we have seen it!" And if we have also a colour camera, and we will take 
photographs, we will take colour photos, and all will be sure that a won­
derful sunset in beautiful colours exists, just as a marvellous sunrise in 
beautiful colours. However,  from our research we  know  that what we 
see is something discernible but not something real. Because if we  are 
in another location, directly under that part of the horizon we looked at. 
and we now look up, we will see the same clouds that were multicoloured 
and beautiful� yet now,  from this side we see the clouds snow-white. But 
they are the same clouds that we saw before on the horizon. 
Did we THINK that we saw that beautiful sunset or  that  beautiful 
sunrise. No, we saw it. Was it there? I ask you, was it there? Anything 
discernible in our gross material world is a phenomenon and the effect 
of a reality. 
The researcher of the truth does not limit himself to phei:iomena, 
because all the phenomena are hidden in relative truth, they are not the 
truth. The truth is behind the phenomena in the Causes - Laws, which 
we have to penetrate in order to see what this truth is. You travel by car. 
You think that where you sit you do not move at all. You have the impres­
sion that everything comes to you, trees, hills, all you see is ·coming to­
wards you. Tell me, who of you has ever travelled in a vehicle and when 
you moved, all those things 01:1tside appeared to stay in their place? You 
get the impression that you do not move, but everything outside is com­
ing towards you.  This is not the truth,  it is not the reality.  Somebody 
outside of the vehicle, in which you are, will see very clearly that the 
vehicle moves and that all those things remain stationary in their place. 
What is the truth now? I can tell you a thousand such phenomena 
that give you the perceptible impression that they are the truth. They 
are true as phenomena of a reality, which we can only understand when 
we penetrate deep into their Causes, deep inside. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 3 
31 

Therefore in  reality we cannot see  the truth within the  gross mat­
erial world, the world of the three dimensions, nor in the so-called psy­
chical worlds, those worlds where human beings will find themselves 
when they abandon their material bodies. Because those worlds are also 
worlds of  time and PLACE impressions, though of a  different meaning, 
more time and SPACE, now. Nor can we  see  the  truth in the  noetical 
worlds, because they are again worlds of forms and impressions. 
So,  as  long as  we  are within these worlds that give us impressions 
we will  know phenomena, the  relative truth, that is  to  say,  we  see  the 
discernible behind which there is the reality. The researcher of the truth 
penetrates the reality behind the phenomena and can then acquire the 
powers of which I spoke. 
We  say that this object is solid. If  I give you an  object that we  call 
solid, you will, no doubt, find that it is solid, because you can take it  in 
your hands and you feel that it is solid. Yet,  orthodox science says that 
nothing solid exists. 
Why do you think that it is  solid? Because the HANDS, with which 
you are holding the  object, vibrate as material, as matter, in about the 
same way (about the same frequency) as the molecules of the object vib­
rate, which we call  solid. The mystics and the researchers of the truth 
can project a so-called etheric hand. Psychotherapists can also do this. 
They project an  etheric hand and  put it  into the  body of a  patient, by 
exercising their willpower, and they can do things,  which you would call 
wonders. In reality,  these achievements are not wonders. In reality,  they 
are  not  more important than what the gross material hand can  do.  You 
have to know how to do it. 
Therefore this material body of a man is not solid, since its hand, its 
etheric hand, can freely enter inside the body, which we call solid, in the 
same way that we enter a mass of steam. Consequently,  what does solid 
mean? In this case, the researcher of the truth is in alliance with ortho­
dox  science today.  I   have said before that man cannot grasp the Truth, 
nor  get  to  know it,  in  the  usual way by  getting impressions from the 
gross material, three dimensional world. In which way does he  receive 
these impressions? Of  course, through the  five senses, seeing, hearing, 
tasting, touching, smelling. He  has five senses, endowed by  God, or 
nature, if you like. With these five senses he receives impressions. Light 
gives vibrations, the vibrations pulsate, the  vibrations  reflect, there ex­
ists something that creates the so-called image. The researchers of the 
truth will, of course, study this. He researches everything. If man did not 
32 

have the five senses, how could he perceive his environment, the world? 
Let 
us suppose that we had no sight, or let us take a blind man out into 
the country, how would he feel the sun and the light? As warmth, as nice 
warmth that dispels the cold; however, he could not see anything around 
him, no tree,  no colour, absolutely nothing, because he does not have 
the gift of sight. Just because he does not have sight, does that mean, 
that nothing exists around him? Of course not. Things exist and he who 
sees is glad to see them. 
I tell you, if man had senses beyond the five senses, if he had only 
one sense more, he would see everything around him quite differently 
than you can see with the five senses. Do you think that everybody sees 
the environment, through his five senses, in the same way? No. 
Do you think that the animals in the animal kingdom, different in 
size as they are, can perceive our environment in the same way as you 
do, even if they had a conscious self-awareness as man has? Again no. 
I tell you that the researchers of the truth can awaken other senses 
and see things, enjoy things, which you now cannot. These things ex­
ist, they are, only you cannot perceive them, because you do not have 
the means to receive these impressions. And if we had more and more 
senses? Then we could enjoy more, much more. Therefore, I tell you 
that the five senses give very few things, believe me, as impressions to 
the human being. 
You will ask me now, can others, apart from us, acquire these abilit­
ies? I am talking about clairvoyance and clairaudience. And 1 tell you, 
yes, definitely, they can acquire these abilities and many other abilities. 
And you will wonder and say, why they and not we ourselves? I tell you, 
no one can succeed unless he has the wish and the inclination, the dis­
position to achieve it. 
Once we begin to endow ourselves with new abilities, we shall see 
more 
truth around us. Now we have man in a gross mate
.
rial body with 
his five senses. He found him.self here, born, growing up and being the 
product of time and space conditions - what else  is the man of to­
day, John, Costas, Maria, Helen? Five hundred years ago we may have 
had other names, other interests, other experiences, ·but again we were 
human beings with five senses.  Other surroundings. We  did not have 
blocks of flats, cars, helicopt�rs, there was another world. Now, we have 
man as we have him today. 
What is the truth around this man? What is this man as a material 
body? Let us see the truth around this man. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 3 
33 

Orthodox science does research, we  have chemistry, biology;  the 
scientists know a lot about the gross material body, and they  still have a 
great deal to learn, for instance regarding metabolism, the glands etc. All 
right, we have the man of today. Today man is a phenomenon of life, but 
we have many other phenomena of life around us. We �ave the crystals, 
the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom, we have life at the bottom 
of the sea.  Looking around us within the gross material world, we can 
see myriads of living forms as phenomena of life. 
What is now the difference between man and all the other forms of 
life? 
When we  look  at  all  these living forms, we  see  that  each kind  of 
living form is  endowed with its own way  of perceiving and reacting to 
its own environment. I have said before that the living organisms do not 
all perceive their environment in  the  same way,  nor  do human beings. 
Their way of dealing with impressions to man's conscious self-awareness 
depends on  their education and  development, because time  is  a  very 
important factor. 
I  see  man now as  a gross material body. Science is still  astounded 
that  they  cannot explain the  phenomenon of  life. And  I  ask  you  now, 
what is life?  Christ said, "I am the  Way, and the Truth, and the  Life." 
What is life? Is life a truth? Is life the truth? Maybe the phenomenon of 
life is the truth? No. The phenomenon of life is the relative truth. I said 
before that it is only  what is perceptible. But now, what is life? 
The fish is life, the eucalyptus tree is life, and the lemon tree is life; 
many things are life.  Man, however, is different, very different. So, now 
we will study man from another side, apart from the gross material body 
and the faculties of the material body, i.e. the five senses. Every human 
being 
has five senses, the atomic scientist as well as the shoeshine boy 
in the streets. But I have said before that not all men interpret the im­
pressions from the surroundings in the same way. 
Now, I  ask you, what is man? Is he the material body, the five senses, 
the hands and arms, the legs and feet, the body, the ability to move the 
material body here and there? 
Now,  we  see man also from another point of view,  as a personality 
self-awareness. 
The truth is that all men, as material bodies, are similar, with small 
individual differences. One  may  be  taller,  the  other smaller,  but  they 
are all human beings, we  could say,  they  all have a human body, and as 
gross material bodies they  all  resemble each other. What about their 
34 

personalities? Are there two human beings in the whole world, who have 
exactly the same personality? 
We  can study the material body of one human being and we will 
know the material body of all human beings. Here is this organ, there is 
that organ. This is the function of this organ, and that is the function of 
that organ. Can we study the personality of man IN GENERAL by studying 
the personality of ONE person? Is the personality self-awareness of man 
the product of his material body? Logic says no. Because there could not 
be such great differences between the personality self-awareness of all 
the human beings, as there are today; after all, their material bodies are 
not so different. 
What makes this difference? What is it that gives us the personality 
self-awareness, again the product of time and space? We will study this per­
sonality self-awareness. How was this personality self-awareness builfr 
Through the impressions and  the  reactions, which  create in man 
certain conditions, certain states, desires, through which man's per­
sonality was built, that means George, Costas, Maria, Helen. We  have 
man's personality self-awareness, another phenomenon of life,  beyond 
the time and place material body. 
We are making progress. Let  us now  look  at man  within society. 
Around you, you can  see  and  study weaknesses, aggressiveness, good 
sense. And you will see a man who builds a character, who begins now to 
control his personality self-aware self, in order to have real control over 
it, with a more distant aim in view? He knows the truth conce�ning his 
self and concerning his situation within the worlds. What will he know? 
Let us assume that he is a mystic, and we call him mystic or researcher 
of the truth, or we give him any other name, he may belong to a serious 
school of studies, - what will this man profit, what is this man gaining? 
Let us  compare him with a man who becomes enraged by the slightest 
provocation, whose behaviour at home and in society is stupid and un­
reasonable.  That he had mad.e big efforts to earn a university degree is 
irrelevant, because we see his behaviour; it  may be the behaviour of a 
highly educated person or the behaviour of an uneducated man. There­
fore, education, hard work and studying at school and university does 
not bestow character on anyone. But he who finds his way, sees now a 
new situation. Christ spok� about a certain way. "I am the way,"  about 
which way, about which truth, and about which life did he speak? "I am 
the Way, the Truth, and the  Life." And when he said"]", he meant each 
one of us,  every human being.

Orthodox science does research, we have  chemistry, biology; the 
scientists know a lot about the gross material body, and they still have a 
great deal to learn, for instance regarding metabolism, the glands etc. All 
·right, we have the man of today. Today man is a phenomenon of life, but 
we have many other phenomena of life around us. We �ave the crystals, 
the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom, we have life at the bottom 
of the sea. Looking around us within the gross material world, we can 
see myriads of living forms as phenomena of life. 
What is now the difference between man and all the other forms of 
life? 
When we look at all these living forms, we see that each kind of 
living form is endowed with its own way of perceiving and reacting to 
its own environment. I have said before that the living organisms do not 
all perceive their environment in the same way, nor do human beings. 
Their way of dealing with impressions to man's conscious self-awareness 
depends on their education and development, because time is a very 
important factor.

that they  cannot explain the phenomenon of life. And I ask you now,

the Way, the Truth, and the  Life." And when he said "I", he meant each 
one of us, every human being. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 3

Now,  what  is the truth about man?  Is man an  animal like all the 
other animals, and worse than the other animals, since men fight and 
kill  each other daily?  Whether they are called Europeans, Americans, 
Africans, Asians? Whether they  are  called underdeveloped or  highly 
civilized? You see now what has happened? 
What are WE as human beings? What is the truth about us, about 
man?  And  how  can  man  approach this  great  Truth  that we call  life? 
Not the phenomenon of life. The phenomena of life we see around us 
as something perceptible. We penetrate into  the  Causes - Laws  and 
we find real life.  Some mystery schools speak about a certain Cosmic 
consciousness. Religion speaks to us about the  Holy Spirit, about the 
descent of the Holy Spirit, which most people consider to be a fairy tale. 
For them reality is paper money, stones in the form of buildings, shining 
metal or stones again. Here we have the great illusion. 
We spoke about life. Life is Truth, is life a truth? What is life? Have 
you once seriously thought about life, what life could l!e? Because when 
you know what life is, you will have to begin to respect that thing called 
life. Not only because you ARE Life and you are living, but also because 
behind the phenomenon of life IS  LIFE. 
What is Life, not as a phenomenon, but as Cause? 
Now we can see the truth as far as life is concerned. What is the 
main characteristic of life? 
The researcher of the truth penetrates the Causes in order to find 
this  Life, and to know what it is.  What do you think  Life is?  Can we 
connect Life with the Total Love? Not what you think of as love. That is 
most of the time nothing more than enchantment and illusion, express­
ion of sexual rushes. This is not  Love,  it is passion. Can we join Life 
with Total Love? Again what is Total Love? 
We  take  now the  phenomena of life  within the  world  here.  We 
see a little bird and we  study it. We  take it  in   the hand and we  feel its 
heart beating, pulsating; have you ever done this? A small little animal. 
Take  it in your arms,  hold  it,  caress it,  cuddle it,  listen to his heart 
beating. This beating of its heart, what do you think it is? The life, the 
love.  Whose love?  Total  love,  everywhere. Look around you  and  see 
what happens in the animal kingdom, in the vegetable kingdom. The 
researcher of the truth pays attention to everything. He studies all, he 
searches all and kneels before Total Wisdom within the Uhiverses. He 
sees the Truth, the  Life,  the Total  Love.  It is possible that the word 
"God" disturbs you.  I  do  not  mention it,  because the  word  GQd  di-
36 

m
inishes Absolute Beingness, which we 
cannot gras
p with our earthen 
brain. 
And where is the Truth? The Truth is within you. It  is everywhere 
ar
ound you. It is within you, because the much 
beloved Joshua said very 
correctly, "the kingdom of the heavens is within you." 
Discover it.  The researcher of the truth makes an  effort to  find it. 
Many have found it  and are  ready to  help you so  that you will find it 
too.

CHAPTER 4 
Life, Desires, Emotions, u;e of Mind, Egoism, Alertness, Healing 
The day is  passing and another day comes, weeks, months, and years 
come and go,  and we are living. - Why?  -  What for? 
We are living in  a human material body, in  which the holy Archang­
els of  the elements, of  the Mind elements are labouring and working 
unceasingly, to keep it in good health. Why? For us.  Is that work in vain 
- for  no purpose - is there no aim behind it? 
We are living. We are living in  a  community, in  a  family, in  a  na­
tion, as human beings, each with his or her own life. If we ask all these 
people living in our community, in our nation, if they are satisfied, what 
do  you  think their reply will be - do  you  think they are satisfied? No, 
most people are not satisfied because they have so  many problems and 
things that are torturing them. Ask them why so many things are making 
them suffer, and who is responsible for that suffering? They should put 
these questions to  themselves, as  we also should put these questions 
to ourselves, but people avoid this. Instead they always find fault with 
someone else, but never with themselves; they are never wrong, every­
one else around them is wrong and behaves in a  bad way. 
Every 
human being should start to think, using  their Mind. - What 
is  life? - Who am I?  - What is  going on around me? We must start us­
ing the Mind, so  that we  can study and know at  least the relative truth 
behind the phenomena. Can we do  that? Of  course we can, but we 
don't do  it.  Why? Because we  think there are more important things to 
do -torturing ourselves with worries and troubles, and with a  kind of 
living 
that does not give us satisfaction. What should we  do, or be taught 
to  do, as soon as  we  become adults: to  use our Mind in right thinking. 
Not to  accept things as they are in society and in the family, and car
ry 
on making the same mistakes; living in  the same stupid way that leads 
to worries, pain and suffering, leading to an overgrown personal egoism. 
38 

Obeying blindly our emotions and desires without studying what they 
are. Why should we follow all that and what for? 
So, 
everybody is becoming a  slave of the circumstan
ces that others 
hav
e  cre
a
ted 
because of their unwillingness to use the Mind and think 
for themselves. 
To think what? To think who we are as persons in society. What are 
we expecting from life? Using reason and not following the example of 
all those a"round, in the family and in the community, since we see that 
th
ose around us are not happy and are suffering. 
We should be taught what a desire is, how a  desire is created. and 
how that desire dominates us and enslaves us. What is this desire, when 
it is fulfilled or when it is not fulfilled? What is it offering us? We must 
be taught what desire is.  These are things that we must work through, 
before we can really start thinking: What do I expect from life? -\Vhat 
can life offer me? Also, what is life expecting from me? -Because Life 
or God is expecting something from us. God did not give us life to 11\'(' 
without any purpose. Just think, so many Archangels of the Mind cll'­
ments -Raph�els, Gabriels and all the others - are working in the mat('­
rial body. They know what work is needed to keep all those organs in the 
body, not only alive, but also always  ready to serve us. Ask yourself why 
these holy Archangels toil so much for us. 
We are living in the material body,  not by right, but by the  grace of 
God. 
Most of us don't deserve to live in our material body that has been 
created and sustained by the  holy Archangels, this alone should wake us 
up to think properly. 
Life also needs something from US, we should not always just daim 
from life. 
' 
So, an adult, man or woman should be taught to relax, an'd ask him­
self or herself, "What do I expect from life?" "And, what should I expect 
from life?" - These are two different things. 
Perhaps we have been contaminated by circumstances, by our par­
ents or by society, and so we carry on in the same stupid way. It is 
not, "What do I want from life", but, "what should I want to have from 
life?" 
We must first come to a conclusion, and look around us. We may 
see sick people in the family or in our environment. But we must seek a 
healthy body because we are entitled to it, and it is very natural. What 
is unnatural, is the illness. We must start thinking how we can have 
Words of Truth 
I Chapter 4 
39 

good health in our body, and avoid becoming ill.  By using the  Mind. We 
should know how to do this. 
Secondly,  we should ask ourselves, "What can we expect from life?" 
- In  view of the  circumstances in our  family, our  financial conditions, 
and the situation in the community, what can life offer? And according 
to what we have before us, can we make changes for the better? Should 
we  go to  live  in  another place? This is okay, we  can  do  this, and  think 
about it, but if we cannot, then we must think what the present circum­
stances are offering us, because maybe we are in these circumstances to 
learn a lesson. 
Why should we be born in a certain community, in a certain family, 
in a certain place? There is a reason for everything, nothing is by chance. 
So  we  find  ourselves in  certain  circumstances. We  should decide 
according to  our  present circumstances, and  qualify ourselves to  live 
a satisfactory life,  for us and for others. For example, if we  do actually 
have the means to get a proper education, we should take the opportun­
ity. Today almost all of us have a chance to educate ourselves, but apart 
from that, what is life offering and what is one expecting from life? - To 
become rich? - To become this or that, why? 
One should put things in balance, always, and use reason. 
We have desires to obtain certain things; should we have them and 
why? Do we need them, if so, why?  Do we want things just because oth­
ers have them? 
So we should study what is this impulse of possessiveness, and what 
can it give us.  Is it a necessity, or is it greediness? Maybe it is one or both 
of these. Start thinking. 
In  this life we have things that please us,  and  that  satisfy us,  and 
give us more and more satisfaction or pleasure. And there are things and 
conditions that give us the contrary - dissatisfaction, more pain, sorrow, 
and  agony. So  this  is  the  point we  should engage ourselves with - in 
this  life we shall have something, either from the one or the other. Of 
course, all the time we have either one or  the other. We  must find out 
that pleasing things, the satisfaction of desire or of certain emotions are 
giving us pleasure, and we must study this kind of pleasure or satisfact­
ion, and ask ourselves is this pleasure or satisfaction lasting? If not, why 
is it not? 
On  the  other side, that which is  giving us  pain and  trouble, and 
dissatisfaction - can we avoid it? If we go on in the same way  what will 
be the  end  of  it?  Clashes, sorrow,  enmity, and  sometimes we  observe 
40 

something else within us:  obstinacy,  and a devilish way.  Why? Why  is 
this or that,  and why should we not do this or that.  Here is where reason 
is needed. · 
Is it. worthwhile prolonging this evil way of living? All these things 
do happen every day in our life, in all communities everywhere in the 
world. We can see it clearly - people are  finding themselves in  such 
states of living. So how  can  we  come  out  of  it? - This is the  point: by 
using the Mind. 
We have said before that man uses all the parts of his body, except 
his  Mind. Men and  women expect others to think for  them  - this  is 
wrong and it is the reason for all the pain and misery that comes to hu­
man beings. 
So  what  should parents and  schools be teaching our  children? -
Mathematics? Why not; but then most of it will be forgotten after leav­
ing school. Geography? Yes,  it is  good  to learn about the planets, the 
earth  and the  people, but  again only  to forget it after leaving school. 
Algebra, Geo'!letry; there are many good things to be taught: History -
this is very dangerous - wars,  hatred and all that should not be  taught 
in schools. Which means, at least 3/4 of what is being taught in schools 
is not only unnecessary, but also dangerous. What should be taught is -
what life is, and - what and who we are. 
Psychology, Parapsychology and all that - yes. But unfortunately, this 
is in  its infancy yet. All sciences have advanced except psychology and 
parapsychology.  In psychology and parapsychology we have to use  Mind 
observation and examine the actions and reactions of a personality. 
A good psychiatrist or psychologist has to use the  Mind in order to 
rearrange the patient's relationship with other human beings. We should 
know how others are behaving and  why they are so  behaving, and  th� 
way in which we have to behave in order to balance things. · 
So, a young man or woman should learn how to use his or her Mind 
for thinking. Now we will start to study it, and we will see that until the 
present time, most people are enslaving their Mind as thought in serving 
emotions a.nd desires that are unbridled and stupid, and reflect most of 
the time egoistic behaviour - this is wrong. 
We  should decide to  free  the  Mind from being a slave  to  desires 
and emotions. We should start to use the Mind, study the emotions and 
desires and decide which of them are justified. And now being master of 
thought, we should know how to use the Mind to satisfy certain desires, 
because not all desires are evil or useless. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 4 
41 

So  we should first learn how to  use the Mind, as  master of  every­
thing, and not as a slave of desires or emotions. 
Emotions - we should stui:ly our emotions. 
We can learn much when we listen to  people talking about their 
troubles and suffering, their love; and what will we find out? That the 
emotion of all those people, men and women, who call it love, is placed 
on egoistic foundations and that is not love at all.  Love for those people 
means being slaves to  the other; for the egoism of  the personality,  they 
want the other to  obey and flatter. And if  this is  not so, the contrary 
happens - they start despising each other, and even enmity and cruelty 
occur. 
We should think soberly - "I have this feeling, what is the quality of 
this feeling,  how will it satisfy me?" "Why should I want to enslave a liv­
ing being for my desires - to handle that person in the way I like?" - But 
every human being has his or  her own will and sooner or  later they will 
not tolerate that behaviour. 
What we see everyday in our society are people cl�iming that they 
love each other.  But after marrying or living together,  they start fighting 
and quarrelling, then they separate and it  ends in divorce. Living vic­
tims. 
I  have said that we want much from life, but life also wants some­
thing from us. If  we give life to children, we cannot sacrifice them on 
the altar of an evil egoism and stupidity - making young Souls unhappy, 
giving them bad lessons and examples which make them continue life in 
the same way. 
So, who is responsible for all  this misery which is  now in  the world, 
and in  all  communities, in  all  countries? The personal egoism of  a  per­
sonality,  because people do  not know or  they do  not want to  use their 
Mind. Use their Mind how? To control that monster in them called ego­
ism. 
So  the most  important  lesson is  for us  to  keep on  the alert; criticiz­
ing our own personality's behaviour, finding behind it that monster called 
egoism - the cause of  all  misery - the cause of all  crimes committed. 
One will ask, "Is  that an  easy thing to  do?" It  is  the easiest thing to  do 
if we  decide to look deeper and see that this egoism of ours is not really 
our self. But as long as we think that the egoism of our personality is our 
self, it is  very difficult.  This egoism is  very cunning, it  masquerades as 
being ourselves, so it  needs much  thinking and the will of  making  self­
analysis, then we will find out the reality. And here is  the greatest  gain 
42 

for us, which is -we are not what we thought we were, we are not just 
an obstinate egoism of a personality. But we are the one that can think, 
decide, and·master things. -I think this is a great gain. 
So by using the Mind soberly, we can   study and find the relative truth 
concerning the circumstances and things in our life. This is the means by 
which we can   save our self from troubles, misery and illness. For all kinds 
of illness coming to the human body come from the psychical body, they 
are psychosomatic. They appear first of all on the psychical plane. All 
hatred, complaints, bad behaviour and obstinacy are poison in the mat­
erial body, and these things entail a kind of self-punishment. Neither God 
nor the Archangels punish us. The Archangels are working unceasingly in 
our bodies to remedy all these illnesses, to heal wounds and mend bones. 
We are the ones who are poisoning our bodies and ourselves by the way we 
are living, the way we are thinking, and the way we are behaving. So one 
should know that jealousy, enmity, hatred, and all the weaknesses have 
already in them the punishment and one must be careful about that. 
Now, by u�ing the Mind and studying things and the circumstances 
all around us, we can know certain laws governing life. We can study 
laws governing physical nature and everything in the material plane. We 
find out that nature is governed by laws which cannot be changed - the 
law of gravity and so on; all the worlds and all the universes are governed 
by laws. 
As our material body is under the physical laws of the physical world, 
so is our psychical body under the laws of the psychical world. There are 
also laws in the noetical plane, the world of thoughts. Our body should 
obey the laws. There are )aws in the worlds of emotion, of desire and of 
thought. As long as we use our emotions, desires and thoughts to build 
up our present-day-personality, we are responsible for what comes to u� 
as a result of any contravention. By using the Mind and by observation 
we can find out about these laws, and these laws are to serve us if we do 
not go against them. 
So we have to think, to observe and insist to know, and that know­
ledge will come to us. 
Now, illness in the material body; can we get rid of illnesses? Yes. 
Which type of illness? Any kind of illness, if it is not too late. How? By 
changing our attitude. Changing in such a way so as to stop the cause of 
the illness, and that illness will stop. 
Even cancers? Yes, many times I have seen even cancers stop tortur­
ing a person. Why are not all of them cured? Because not all of them are 
Words of Truth I Chapter 4 
43 

willing to change. They are not willing to become good people, loving 
people.  They say they are. But is  it  easy to change your character in a 
day or two? If  we cannot change we have to  suffer, but I don't think that 
it is  not possible to change, if  one really wants to have that change. 
A  cause of illness is guilt, subconsciously felt, and we can see this 
in the Bible. First of all, Christ, before curing anyone, felt the need to 
lighten that personality from the burden of guilt, saying  always,  "Your 
sins are forgiven." That was a kind of suggestion, the occurrence of auto­
suggestion; they believed they were cured. There are many psychologi­
cal teachings in  the Bible. 
Second is faith. What is faith? Believing. Can a  person believe 
something that is not real? Impossible. Believing means learning, study­
ing, knowing and believing. Christ said, "Your faith has saved you". So 
knowing the laws governing health, I mean knowing the laws of  the psy­
chical world,  brings relief to a man or woman. Is that all we can learn by 
using the Mind? No, because by using the Mind everyday we learn new 
things, which we need to  know in  our life. 
We can learn the natural laws, by using the Mind and by observat­
ion. So our life should be a  continuous study. Study life, what life is. 
Study our material body and how to keep it  in good health. Study the 
most important lesson, which is our personality. This is the point - who 
is studying the personality? Are we double? Who will study,  concentrate, 
insist to know, and who is  the other, that self of ours to  be criticized, to 
be studied,  that has too many faults, and who will see these faults and 
who will decide how to correct these faults? Who is the other self that 
will reason with these faults and wishes to continue with these faults 
because they are pleasing him or her. This is  the point  where we can 
catch out our egoism, saying, "No, I am not you, I am your master,  and 
until this present moment you have been deceiving me, pretending that 
you are myself, making me behave in such a  way that I am ashamed. 
Making me behave in such a  way that brings me pain." The ego is  a 
masochist, he likes that pain because it gives him the sense of living, but 
that docs not satisfy us. 
So. by using the Mind we find the relative  truth concerning our 
personality. The relative truth, because there is something more to  know 
about the personality. We are not the personality and we are not the self 
behaving as the personality. But we find out that our self, behind the 
personality, is  a  glorious self. But even so, we shall study now the self, 
muster of the present-day-personality. So we find our self. our real self 
44 

e
xpressing itself in  various stages. And we  study what we  call  aware­
ness, consciousness, subconciousness and Superconsciousness. These 
are very diffi.cult to deal with for the time being. We cannot do that un­
less  we ar.e  free from our personal egoism, that egoism which disturbs 
us,  which is  always  claiming the  satisfaction of desires and  making us 
believe that it is serving us. 
So it needs much thought, concentration and especially observation 
- nothing should escape our attention, which means studying our life. 
Usually people want to interfere in the life of others, criticizing and 
asking them to change. They don't start with themselves, but rather find 
faults in others, yet the same faults are in themselves but  they cannot 
see them. Sometimes they see their faults but consider them as virtues. 
So  we have to  use  the right measure. The same measure for  us  as  for 
others, our family and our neighbours. Not two measures, one for us and 
another for everybody else. We must use the right measure, that means 
not overdoing it. 
Should we  be  strict with our  children? No, that is  bad. Should we 
punish children or others? No, that is also very bad. I do not approve of 
these measures. We should use golden measures, not measures made of 
wood or iron, but golden measures which is love. If we  use this measure 
of love, studying and expressing love, and then point out things in a gentle 
way, then people will be ready to accept it,  otherwise they will not. 
So we have to study the character of people, and according to  their 
character, use the method to  enlighten them (without trying to change 
them). We do it not for the sake of changing them, but to help them feel 
happier and more reasonable in life. If we believe that we should change 
them, then  we  are  not serving anybody except our own egoism. So we 
must be very careful,  because the egoism is a devil presenting itself as 
an "angel of light". 
I have said before that the egoism of the personality is very cunning, 
and we should always be  very careful. To  be  careful, not  to  allow the 
egoism to interfere either by presenting itself as an "angel of light" or as 
charity and goodness. We shall see what is behind all that, and in life we 
should always be careful. Many things are deceiving and one should be 
careful not to be deceived. 
In  how many ways can we  use  the  Mind? In  every way and in  all 
ways. This is what we need, just to learn how to use our  Mind. How to 
use it as reasoning thought. Nothing  should  escape our attention,  good 
or bad. I don't like to use the word evil, there is no evil  man. No human 
Words of Truth I Chapter 4 
45 

being is evil - stupid yes, ignorant yes - and at the same time unhappy 
and self-punishing, but not evil. No human being, being a God in nature 
can be evil, we should have· this in mind.  So hating a human being is 
like hating God. We cannot help any human being by criticizing, or with 
enmity and hostility. 
Human beings around us that we are calling evil, are in need of our 
love, not of our hatred, our complaints or criticism. Christ said that we 
should never criticize. 
A real human being should have a heart radiating love as a bright 
sun,  lighting the faces of every human being.  When the sun gives us 
light, does it deny its light and hidden warmth to those we consider evil? 
No, so likewise we  are supposed to make our hearts a sun radiating love 
- love for everyone. And this love - this light - everyone is in need of to 
find his or her way. 
People who call others sinners, criminals, thieves and by many other 
names, are usually people who are of the same kind.  Because the ones 
that are different would not observe that. All thest:  people are  not in 
need of our criticism; they are in need of our love. 
What about giving guidance? 
Nobody will accept guidance, not even our children. Christ did not 
say  guide the people, for he was the greatest psychologist in the world. 
Christ said, "Thus should be the light of what you do, of your actions, 
that others will see and follow it." And he said not only that, but added 
that we should glorify our heavenly Father. 
So people are not in  need  of our guidance, they don't  want to be 
asked to change, but they will follow us, by seeing what we are doing. 
Now we should try to find out why we are committing this fault of 
criticizing people around us. Most people do the criticizing by just goss­
iping.  Usually in a society there are many rumours and, of course, for 
every thing there is a cause behind it -the enmity of one person towards 
another - creating imaginary stories against another,  and people enjoy 
spreading these rumours. Being in a place and hearing rumours, are we 
sure that we are using our Mind and reason, and not accepting those 
things, and  not  allowing ourselves to  continue interfering by  saying 
something 
we just suspect. This is what happens in most communities. 
We heard so, so we think we have the right to repeat it. Stop and think. 
We know that every thought is creating an elemental. Elementals are all 
around us, and especially, elementals of gossip. Do we strengthen these 
elementals, or by  avoiding taking part in gossip, de-energize them. 
46 

To attack those who spread rumours is stupid, because in doing so, 
they will only persist in spreading more rumours. So, the best way is to 
keep silent and say nothing, and send an elemental of kindness to both 
the accuser and the accused. Send a warm wish that they should recon­
cile and love each other. This is the right behaviour. 
Many people say that they are obsessed by demons, but in reality 
they are under the burden of their own elementals. The best thing to do 
is to change their attitude and their way of thinking, because they are 
the  first to be attacked by the malicious elementals they are creating. 
So we should be responsible for what we create. Every moment people 
are using the Mind in the wrong way. Everybody is using the Mind, but 
often in the wrong way. Not as masters of the Mind, using right thought, 
but by getting mixed up in gossip, and in the way other people are think­
ing  around them  and adding to it.  We  should be careful how we  are 
using this holy Supersubstance of the Mind.  Because we shall see the 
Mind not only as thought, but also as energy having form, as elementals 
affecting the life of everybody around us, and our own life. So if we are 
to correct this 
-
world, we should correct ourselves in how we are using 
the Mind. 
Now we shall do an exercise: 
Take deep comfortable breaths and relax your body completely. Feel 
you are completely relaxed.  Start from the feet, knees, belly, chest, and 
head. You are completely relaxed. 
Now  relax  and  free yourself from  every  thought or  feeling; forget 
who you are.  Feel that you are in your whole body and not in the head. 
Feel your body, you are in the whole body completely free from emotions, 
desires and thoughts. You are now in your material body - feeling it. 
Now ask yourself the question - am I living in my material body? 
- At this very moment the holy Archangels are working in my material 
body; in every  blood cell, in every artery, in every vain, in every organ, 
everywhere the holy Archangels are working for me.  For me to feel and 
live in this material body, considering myself a God.  I am living in this 
material body now - I  am in it - I  have the right to be in it. Am I using 
the material body in the right way? Do I really give love with my material 
body? 
Am I caressing a child, giving a kiss, embracing somebody I love, or 
do I give slaps and kicks instead? 
I am allowed to express myself through this material body in many 
ways - using the eyes and seeing. It is very serious work  by  the  holy 
Words of Truth I Chapter 4 
47 

Archangels of  the  elements to keep the  liquids of the  eyes  in  such a 
state that I can see through my material eyes. 
Using my mouth in talking and speaking, am I sure  I  am using my 
mouth in the right way and giving love or am I wounding with it or of­
fending or humiliating others? 
Am  I  using speech - a   gift  from the  Father,  who has  deprived the 
animals of this gift - in the right way? 
Christ said  that  what enters through the  mouth does not  harm, 
but what is coming out of the mouth can be very harmful; therefore be 
careful. 
Who am  I? 
How do  I  behave? Am  I the mas
ter of  my behaviour or 
the victim of egoism? Enough.

CHAPTER 5 
Love, Divine Love 
What is  Love?  Of course, the word "Love" stands for itself.  But does 
it mean the same thing to  everyone?  Someone may use that word and 
mean a time-and-place state that satisfies his or her egoisti'c desires. So, 
what can Love really be? 
Is there an Idea called Love? Many people may wrongly think that 
Love is one of the many Ideas in the worlds of Ideas, Causes and Laws, 
in the noetic worlds. No, it is not, because these worlds serve the need 
to expand the divine Wisdom, Goodness and Power in order to create 
and build universes, but Love is not an Idea. 
Love is the ABSOLUTE BEINGNESS, Goo. 
In order not to confuse the meaning of  Love, let us call it divine 
Love, even though I said that the word Love stands for itself. 
If we say that divine Love is the inextinguishable Light,  then the 
love - the way human beings can understand - may be compared to the 
light of a candle, or an electric lamp, or a spot light, or even the sun. 
Love in time-and-place is a PHENOMENON OF  DIVINE LOVE. 
When  I say that Love is Light, I do not mean the phenomenon hu-
' 
man beings can see through their eyes -a  limited range of frequencies of 
vibration - but rather EVERYTHING IS LIGHT, the psychical, the noetical, 
the noetic and the Super Light. 
Love  or  divine Love  is the Absolute Beingness and,  since  a  holy 
Monad is part of the Absolute Beingness - in  Its One-ness and  in Its 
Multiplicity - Love must also be the nature of a holy Monad. 
We will look at Love macrocosmically and microcosmically. MAc­
ROCOSMICALLY? Love is God Itself, the Absolute Beingness, and Its ex­
pression as Christ Logos as well as Its Holy Spiritual expression. What 
can we say about divine Love as a nature of Absolute Beingness? Divine 
Self-sufficiency? Of course. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 5 
49 

Everything is built;  whole universes are created through the  Holy 
Spirit and through the Chri�t Logos. If the nature of the Christ Logos 
and of the Holy Spirit were not Love, how could they have built,  how 
could they have GIVEN THEMSELVES in order to build and create the uni­
verses? So, the first Principle and Authority is the expression of Love. 
We  see macrocosmically Love,  the Absolute Beingness Itself,  and 
the expressions of Love: the Christ Logos and the Holy Spirit. What is 
Love - is it the expression of Love or is it Love itself? 
Since the Christ Logos is the Absolute Beingness, the Christ Logos 
is Love, and creating the universes through Mind, the Christ Logos is 
also  the  expression of  Love.  The  same  goes  for  the  Holy  Spirit, and 
also for the Archangels. So, in the world of existence everything EXISTS 
WITHIN divine Love,  but it IS NOT divine Love;  everything exists as a 
phenomenon of divine Love. 
Then, MICROCOSMICALLY, we find love and divine Love.  Do not as­
sume that human beings cannot FEEL divine Love; as Self-aware Souls 
they do. But as present-day-personalities they experience love as a pow­
er that revolves AROUND A CENTRE - their own personality-self. We now 
find in the worlds of separateness love with a centre. 
Can you imagine worldly love that does not satisfy the egoism of the 
human personality's self?  Is this conceivable? From the lowest animal 
expression that human beings call love to the most  perfect time-and­
place expression of love in the microcosm, we shall always find a centre 
- the  time-and-place I-ness of the human being - around which the 
phenomenon of love revolves. However, when a human being loves as 
a Self-aware holy Monad, Superconsciously as a Self-aware Soul, is the 
I-ness the centre? Is the expression in time-and-place? Of course not. 
Now, MACROCOSMICALLY, how do the  Christ Logos and  the  Holy 
Spirit love the world, the creation, the universes? Egoistically? Of course 
not. 
Macrocosmically, Love is constantly given, it gives abundantly, it is 
not interested in taking. 
Microcosmically, on the other hand, love gives little and asks much 
more in return. Have you ever considered this? 
So, there is a great difference between love and divine Love. With 
love we give, in order to take, and we demand a lot more than we give. 
Macrocosmically, Love only gives.  Love is given by the Absolute Being­
ness;  It gives life,  the phenomenon of life.  Has the Christ Logos, who 
is the "Light that gives  light to every living human being coming into 
50 

the world" and makes them different from the animals, ever asked for 
anything?  People even deny the very existence of the Christ Logos.  The 
1-ness of the Christ Logos, as the Absolute Beingness, is simply  ignored 
by many. How many people who  call themselves Atheists deny the ex­
istence of a life force the Christ Logos in the universes? The Christ 
Logos is not concerned about this; It gives. It always gives, both holy­
spiritually and logoically.  It works as the Holy Spirit in every single cell, 
at the centre of every atom, of every cell of the material body. It builds; 
It is constantly building in various ways. It makes the circumstances 
in such a  way that even the personality that denies its existence can 
live comfortably in a  microcosm, even foolishly. Christ Logos asks  for 
nothing. It simply gives and always gives. And the hairs on the head of a 
foolish person are also numbered and grow with mathematical accuracy, 
because there is divine Love. 
Can you think of a  universe - material, psychical, noetical or noetic 
- which is not within divine Love? 
All the hells, even the most frightful hells, which are states of the 
psychical worfd, actually subplanes of the psychical world, are in the di­
vine Love, and positive influence is exerted on them, first to bring relief 
from pain and later to lead to assimilation with the Light. 
WHERE THERE IS Goo, there is divine Love. 
When we understand what divine Love is, we will also understand 
what love towards our fellow human beings is, the love that was taught 
by the Beloved One, Christ. "Love thy neighbour as you love thyself, 
because it  is yourself." 
When human beings are detached from the illusions of the world of 
separateness, they will realize that - as Self-aware 1-ness - they are one 
with everyone. When we no longer see ourselves as the centre  aroun'd 
which revolves the phenomenon we call love in the material world, we 
will enter in the divine Love. This may be the first time that we feel our 
personality assimilated to our Soul Self-awareness. Inside the boundless 
Light of Love the perfection of the personality takes place; the personal­
ity enters its Inner Self. 
So, we can come to the following conclusions: 
Love as a  time-and-place expression, as perfect as it  may be, has its 
centre around which love will revolve, as long as this centre 1-ness is 
the present-day-personality. However, when the self-awareness of this 
centre 1-ness expands towards the inner Soul-Self-awareness, then the 
Light of the divine Love will, for the first time, light the personality self. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 5 
51 

How will our lower self feel within the Light that is of the same nature 
as our Soul-Self-awareness, the first radiation of divine Love? Pleasure? 
Joy?  Satisfaction? But  these  feelings are  poor compared to  what  our 
personality self will feel in the so-called first theosis. When the mortal 
dresses in divine Love, there is the Light of immortality; and the mortal 
dressed in the Light of immortality is divine Love. 
We said that Love is not an  Idea in the worlds of  Ideas.  It is the 
ABSOLUTE BEINGNESS Itself. The nature and the expression of the Ab­
solute Beingness. 
So, we see the divine Love in two different stages: cause and expres­
sion.  Cause: The nature of  the Absolute Beingness. Expression: The 
Creation of the universes. 
Perhaps now we find an explanation as to why the universes have 
been created. One fact must be emphasized: The Absolute Beingness, 
God, is everywhere and fulfils everything, and because Its nature is the 
divine Love there is no part of It, there is no part in It, that is not divine 
Love. A rational person can always rely on this divine Love.  Let us not 
be like the fish that swim in a whole ocean and yet are thirsty. Let us not 
be like the blind that are in an environment full of light, yet they cannot 
see. 
Light is necessary for the material eyes to see objects. But human 
beings also  gain  knowledge of  existing material objects through the 
Light of divine  Love.  Through the  Light of the divine Love,  our Self­
awareness, be it as personality self-awareness or as Soul-Self-awareness 
(or higher), will have full understanding of the existence of all its sur­
roundings. 
How is that? Not by wanting the petty little self to be a centre around 
which everything is rotating, but by expanding his or her Self-awareness 
into the universes, into everything, and feeling everybody and everything 
else as if it was his or her self, enjoying it and rejoicing with the Father. 
Then we are assimilated with both the Creation and the Creator. How 
do we  do it?  First of all  through sharp concentration, understanding, 
knowledge, and later through theosis, assimilation of at-one-ment. 
In the Light of the divine Love there are no rich or poor, superior or 
inferior. There is divine expansion in time-and-place expressions. 
It is not easy to understand what divine Love is, because it is not 
easy to pass and go beyond the centre around which until now every­
thing revolved, all the phenomena that give us satisfaction, which we 
call love.  We must proceed beyond this centre and forget who we are 
52 

as present-day-personalities. We  must enter a common state, common 
selfhood with all fellow human beings, a self-awareness beyond our per­
s
onalities, 
Soul-Self-awareness. And once we do enter, for the first time, 
we will  realize that we are enlightened, in the Light of the divine Love. 
Finally I should like to share with you two thoughts: first, "Someone 
who truly loves has  nothing to  forgive." Think about it;  there is  deep 
meaning in it. 
Secondly,  we  have an  example of  divine Love: Christ's experience 
on the cross. In His great agony he looked with pity in  His eyes to  His 
persecutors and said, "Father, forgive them, for they  do not know what 
they do."

CHAPTER 6 
Vibration, Life-Light, Ethers 
Today we  shall talk about Light, Super-Light and the  light that has  as 
its source a vibrating material object. We see the characteristics of this 
light, i.e.  the capacity of it to strike an object, to reflect,  and to bring in 
its  reflection the  image of  the  object that it  first struck. Therefore, in 
reality,  it  reflects the  vibrations of  the  object, the colours (because the 
colours are also vibrations). 
. 
What is the source of light? 
We  have said that it  is  the  material source which vibrates. What 
makes it  vibrate? And what is  this vibration before it reaches the point 
where it gives us the light? 
Light, material light, is  vibration of  a  certain frequency. These 
vibrations are interpreted by  the optic nerve.  There are also vibrations 
which are lower and vibrations which are higher than those interpreted 
by the optic nerve as light. Such etheric vibrations are not visible to the 
human eye. 
What is the connection between these vibrations and the light? 
If we could classify all the existing vibrations according to their fre­
quency on  a  scale, from the  lowest to  the  highest, we  would discover 
that only a tiny part of the vibrations are interpreted as light by the hu­
man eye. What are all the  other vibrations? And something else: If the 
human optic nerve and the composition of the material brain were not 
as they are today,  let  us say  that they were slightly different and  could 
interpret light of another range of vibrations, maybe lower, maybe higher 
than now, the  material  universe would instantaneously be  different in 
appearance. Have  you  ever thought about this? 
The whole universe is vibrating. Today,  science talks about electric­
ity,  magnetism, and cosmic rays. There are  in  the  universes so  many 
things that science still does not know or cannot even imagine. 
54 

I repeat, the material universe vibrates and human beings can only in­
ter
pret through vision a few vibrations as light. And, of course, animals in­
terpret vibrations in a similar way. Some animals can even interpret lower 
or higher vibrations as light. As I said, the material universe is vibrating ... 
Now, we ask some questions and try to answer them: 
Who causes these vibrations? The one who causes these vibrations 
is the  Life-Giver.  Through what means are the vibrations vibrating? We 
have mentioned in other lessons that everything in the worlds of exist­
ence is Mind. This is the means. What is it that actually vibrates?  Every­
thing in the material universe vibrates. What are vibrations? Life-Light 
which gives us the phenomena of life. This is the purpose of vibrations. 
In the depths of the sea, where man believes that there is only deep 
darkness, life  exists; and  light  exists for  that  life.  There are  sensory 
organs capable of interpreting the vibrations at the bottO'ITI of the sea as 
light.  Through these organs,  living  forms can see at the  bottom of the 
sea in the same way that humans do in their environment. But for a hu­
man being there is only deep darkness down there. 
Vibration
-
s exist around you that can be seen by Archangelic Orders, 
and they live in this light. These vibrations are higher than those which 
man interprets as light; for humans they are invisible. They are beyond 
the vibrations that science can measure. The same applies to electricity 
that is not yet expressed. Do not think that the material universe is only 
what we can see and touch! 
We  have  often talked about the  material universe and  its  etheric 
double, about the psychical universe, its seven planes and  seven sub­
planes, and its etheric double, and the noetical world and the noetical 
universes. But very little has been said and very little can be said about 
these worlds. What you can see, touch and perceive in the material uni­
verse is a small percentage of the real existence. 
Just to give you an idea:  In the material universe, material things ex­
ist that are more refined, rarefied, thinner than the solid matter around 
us.  They are invisible and cannot be perceived. Shall we say that they 
are  in  the  ethereal worlds, in the  etheric counterpart of  the  material 
world? Yes, of course they are. 
Just as a human being has a material body with its etheric double, so 
does the planet earth and so do all the other heavenly bodies, suns or plan­
ets, have their etheric counterparts; despite the condition that they may 
be in,  fiery or solid. And we call the etheric counterpart, with regard to 
their nature and work, imprinting, kinetic, aesthetic, and creative ethers. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 6 
55 

However, there are·more than these four ethers that I have men­
tioned; there are actually seven, but we will not talk about this. 
We have mentioned the material world we are aware of.  It has three 
elements and another four which are eth.eric. The three elements are fire, 
water and solid matter (the sun, the sea, and the earth). However, we also 
have worlds inside the planet, around the planet, and beyond the planet: 
the  etheric counterpart of  the planet. Therefore we have  another four 
worlds corresponding to  the  imprinting,  kinetic, aesthetic, and creative 
ethers of the planet.  Similar conditions exist also for all the other heavenly 
bodies. 
By insight, we can see that the pulse of life embraces the planet 
and is in the planet. It is called the creative ether of the planet, and it is 
responsible for the coordination of the four seasons and the circulation 
of the sap in plants; it renews the life in the phenomena of life, in the 
animal and vegetable kingdoms. The earth is a living planet just like a 
human being; it is not just a mass of dead matter. 
Now,  for the  kinetic ether of the planet: The etheric vitality in and 
around the planet, the kinetic ether of the planet, has until now. been 
used  by human  beings only subconsciously for breathing. But we will 
use it consciously in future, in order to sustain and maintain our mater­
ial body. 
We will know the kinetic ether of the planet better and we will come 
into contact with the divine entities who live there and use the kinetic 
and aesthetic ethers in Creation. 
Once you have succeeded in entering the imprinting ether of the 
planet for the first time, you will enter the memory of the planet. Keep 
in mind that you will not enter the cosmic memory, but only the memory 
of the planet. 
Once you consciously feel your material body and its etheric dou­
ble complete in its three lower elements and in its four higher etheric 
elements, the ethers, then you proceed towards conscious awareness of 
your psychical body,  through its etheric double. This is an even more 
difficult task  to accomplish, but  it is also  more pleasant, with  more 
powers. 
When  you enter the imprinting ether of the planet, you will have 
the first intuition, not yet the complete intuition of the psychical world. 
You will then be able to come into contact with divine entities which 
work in the creation of the planet. You will also be able to contact the 
Archangels of the elements, their elementals, the angels that supervise 

all the various kinds of vegetable and animal kingdoms, spirits of fire and 
water. But beware, you will also see malicious entities of matter, water, 
air and fire, although they do not really belong to the psychical world. 
What are the dangers and benefits of gaining this knowledge? 
DANGERS. One of the dangers is that, when someone gains certain 
powers and they are not able to make good use of them or consciously 
make bad use of them, then they will become black magicians, with the 
corresponding consequences. 
Another danger is that, if someone begins to boast about himself by 
showing off his abilities, for example by the phenomenon of telekinesis, 
then he is increasing the egoism of his personality 
Be careful that you do not fall into the traps of flattery, showing off 
and performing for vain purposes. What is important is the work itself, 
not the showing off of the present-day-personality. 
BENEFITS. Once someone has gained these abilities, he can enrich 
his etheric double with the etheric vitality  of the planet, for his own 
health and, ii!_ combination with the imprinting ether, he will be able to 
send out powerful elementals over short or long distances, in order to 
help other people. 
Is it not wonderful to see a smile blooming on the face of a suffer­
ing person and to see a pale cheek gain healthy colour? This is what the 
Creator wants. The illness is something unnatural; it is the result of a 
violation of the natural law. When God created the worlds, His purpose 
was that man in these worlds enjoy happiness and perfect health. As co­
creators of God we have to help people to establish harmony with the 
Law and the divine Will. 
QuESTION. During the processes of maintenance and the sustaining 
of the material body, do the various organs move with the same vibra­
tion, or do they differ and then harmonize once they operate? 
ANSWER. It is the various vibrations that give characteristics to the 
various organs. There are different vibrations for the brain,  different 
vibrations for the lungs, the liver, the spleen, the heart, the kidneys, the 
muscles, the nerves. 
And then we have a sum total of vibrations, harmonized vibrations, 
which give us the human body. 
It is the Holy Spirit that harmonizes these vibrations, keeps them in 
their position and harmonizes the functioning of the vibrations amongst 
each other, in their totality, through the nervous system; the sympathetic 
and parasympathetic nervous systems.

However, there are· more than these four ethers that I  have men­
tioned; there are actually seven, but we will not talk about this. 
We have mentioned the material world we are aware of.  It has three 
elements and another four which are etheric. The three elements are fire,

have worlds inside the  planet, around the planet, and beyond the planet: 
the  etheric counterpart of  the  planet. Therefore we  have another four 
worlds corresponding to  the  imprinting, kinetic, aesthetic; and creative 
ethers of the planet. Similar conditions exist also for all the other heavenly 
bodies. 
By  insight, we  can see  that the  pulse of  life  embraces the  planet 
and is in the planet. It is called the creative ether of the planet, and it is 
responsible for the coordination of the four seasons and  the circulation 
of the sap in  plants; it  renews the life in the phenomena of life, in the 
animal and vegetable kingdoms. The earth is  a  living planet just like a 
human being; it is not just a mass of dead matter. 
Now, for  the kinetic ether of the planet: The etheric vitality in and 
around the planet, the kinetic ether of  the  planet, has  until now. been 
used by  human beings only subconsciously for  breathing. But we will 
use it consciously in future, in  order to sustain and maintain our mater­
ial body. 
We will know the kinetic ether of the planet better and we will come 
into contact with the  divine entities who live there and  use the kinetic 
and aesthetic ethers in Creation. 
Once you have succeeded in  entering the  imprinting ether of the 
planet for the first time, you will enter the memory of the planet. Keep 
in mind that you will not enter the cosmic memory, but only the memory 
of the planet. 
Once you consciously feel your material body and its etheric dou­
ble complete in  its three lower elements and in its  four higher etheric 
elements, the ethers, then you proceed towards conscious awareness of 
your psychical body, through its etheric double. This is  an  even more 
difficult task to  accomplish, but  it  is  also more pleasant, with more 
powers. 
When  you enter the  imprinting ether of  the  planet, you will have 
the first intuition, not yet the complete intuition of the psychical world. 
You will then be  able to  come into contact with divine entities which 
work in  the creation of the  planet. You will  also be able to  contact  the 
Archangels of the elements, their elementals, the angels that supervise 
56 

all the various kinds of vegetable and animal kingdoms, spirits of fire and 
water. But beware,  you will also see malicious entities of matter, water, 
air and fire,  although they do not really  belong to the psychical world. 
What are the dangers and benefits of gaining this knowledge? 
DANGERS. One of the dangers is that, when someone gains certain 
powers and they are not able to  make good use of them or consciously 
make bad use of them, then they will become black magicians, with the 
corresponding consequences. 
Another danger is that, if someone begins to boast about himself by 
showing off his abilities, for example by  the phenomenon of telekinesis, 
then he is increasing the egoism of his personality 
Be careful that you do not fall into the traps of  flattery, showing off 
and  performing for vain purposes. What is important is the work itself. 
not the showing off of the present-day-personality. 
BENEFITS. Once someone has gained these abilities, he can enrich 
his  etheric double with the  etheric vitality of  the  planet, for  his  own 
health and, in combination with the imprinting ether, he will be able to 
send out powerful elementals over short or long distances, in order to 
help other people. 
Is it not wonderful to see a smile blooming on  the face of a suffer­
ing person and to see a pale cheek gain healthy colour? This is what the 
Creator wants. The illness is something unnatural; it is the result of a 
violation of the natural law.  When God created the worlds, His purpose 
was that man in these worlds enjoy happiness and perfect health. As co­
creators of  God we have to  help people to establish harmony with the 
Law and the divine Will. 
QUESTION. During the processes of maintenance and the sustaining 
of  the material body,  do the  various organs move with the same vibra­
tion, or do they differ and then harmonize once they operate? 
ANSWER. It is the various vibrations that give characteristics to the 
various organs.  There are  different vibrations for  the  brain, different 
vibrations for the lungs, the liver, the spleen, the heart, the kidneys, the 
muscles, the nerves. 
And then we have a sum total of vibrations, harmonized vibrations, 
which give us the human body. 
It is the Holy Spirit that harmonizes these vibrations, keeps them in 
their position and harmonizes the functioning of the vibrations amongst 
each 
other, in their totality, through the nervous system; the sympathetic 
and parasympathetic nervous systems.

Today our lesson is about "thought" and  "thinking." What is thought? 
Many will say,  "Don't we know what thought is?  Thinking means to 
know what thought is." But I tell you that you do not know what thought 
really is, because you have not yet analyzed this question. 
What is the nature of thought? What do you think thought is? 
He  who says  that he  thinks - is he thinking consciously,  self-con­
sciously,  or subconsciously,  mechanically? Subconscious thinking does 
not  serve the  person very much, as we  shall see  in  the  course of  this 
lesson. 
What is thought? We have said that everything is Mind as Supersub­
stance, substance and super-matter. We are not concerned now with the 
lowest vibration of Mind, which is called matter. Yet, everything is Mind. 
Thought is a form; thinking is a way to  obtain - from the boundless 
ocean of  Mind Supersubstance - formless Mind in  its unexpressed, al­
ready existing condition. And we give it, in a certain way, form, we "form­
ate"  it,  and  we  bring it as  a noetical image or  picture within our inner 
world, our noetical world. But we also project it as an elemental into the 
noetical world of  the environment around us. 
Have you ever thought about this - that this is thought, thinking? 
We  can say that thought is  the  formation of  Mind, Mind in  a cert­
ain form, as  specific pictures or images. Until now, man has learned to 
create these images completely mechanically. And these images are the 
product of his aims, his wishes, and his desires that are found in life and 
in his environment. 
But has he analyzed what thought is? What causes thought? Who is 
the thinker? What is the aim and what is the result of this work called 
thinking? 
58 

No-one has ever  thought about  anything that  had not  first come 
to his notice, which he had not first become aware of.  Not because he 
could not do otherwise, but because he is not used to doing that. 
At the moment, man needs something on the material level, in the 
world of the phenomena, to arouse certain feelings in him, which is the 
beginning to express thought in himself. 
Of course, the researcher of the truth will see, when he proceeds, 
that he can finally and independently of the phenomena of the different 
worlds (the material, the psychical and the noetical worlds) make use 
of  Mind in a way that an ordinary man will not know. And this way or 
method is powerful; thought now is power, tremendous power. We can 
call it "creative thought." 
To have the phenomenon of thought, we must have -a oeing which 
we can call self-awareness, which is thinking - which is the thinker. 
But if we make an analysis, what is self-awareness? Is it not simply 
a formation oJ divine thought around a being? This needs much study. 
I have said that any form of self-awareness, namely, the expression 
of ourselves, is the product of thought, meditation and reflection of the 
subconscious. 
The fact  that  man  is  able  to think,  to  use  Mind  Supersubstance 
and to form ("formate") it into thought - even though man has not yet 
reached the point where his thoughts are materialized - is proof that 
everything around us, in all the universes, is a product of divine thought 
- divine thought materialized. 
In today's world, man,  the thinker, has not reached the perfection 
of  his  Father. He  has  �ot  become perfect, even  as his  Father which 
is in heaven is  perfect. He will become perfect when he as a thinker 
expresses Mind as power and willpower; the result of this is materializa­
tion - the accomplishment of the thinker. 
Man projects with his thoughts, without even realizing it,  a pow­
er-form, which we call elemental. According to Joshua Immanuel the 
Christ they are spirits, dumb  and  deaf.  This  means that  they do  not 
have neither in themselves nor of themselves any wisdom of the word 
(Logos). Deaf means that it is without contents, a time-and-place ex­
pression, and nothing else. 
This is, of course, not the purpose of forming Mind into thought. 
But later, man will learn to use this substance and Supersubstance of 
Mind as thought-power,  elementals endowed with life. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 7 
59 

Looking at all the phenomena of life around us, we see that in all the 
phenomena of life that have.been created and are living today there are 
exact projections of divine thought endowed with life. 
Now, thought, thinking: What is the cause of thought? If we become 
aware of a certain condition, or if we see and comprehend the existence 
of an  object, this is a  necessary process leading to  the beginning of  a 
thought. But how? 
If  no  interest is  created to  know this or  that, or to possess this  or 
that, no  thought will occur. Therefore, INTEREST is a  precondition for 
thinking. 
We are thinking. Thinking means to  create noetical images or  pic­
tures within our  noetical body.  Thought remains. It  is  not  something 
that is useful at the time when we are thinking and then dissolves and is 
lost.  No,  every thought remains in a part of our lower self (the present­
day-personality-self) in the so-called subconsciousness. We can,  at any 
moment, bring it up to the surface as memory. And we can again see the 
noetical image or picture, or the state/condition; which had previously 
excited us, which had made us vibrate. 
Now we see a new factor. We have said that something made us VI­
BRATE, it created a condition, which we call DESIRE, FEELING, EMOTION. 
What is feeling? What is thought? And what is the relationship be­
tween them? We  have to  separate these two conditions although they 
are made up of the same substance. We see that any thought-image or 
elemental needs for its continuous life a cohesive power, that means it 
must have in itself FEELING and DESIRE. 
Let  us  look at  elementals. Why  do  we  call  these psychonoetical 
forms that we project elementals? Because they are built up of the four 
forms of  the  elements; of  the  noetical, psychical, ethereal and  gross 
material worlds. 
Now, let us make a thought. We see a tree, we see it. "I see it" means 
that  I  perceive it  and  become aware that  it exists somewhere here or 
there. But how can I see and perceive this tree? 
We have light and we have distance. Light is etheric vibration. When 
the vibrations fall on a surface, they adapt themselves to the surface as 
form and colour and return, taking the image of the object (the tree) up 
into our eyes. 
Think what a marvellous process all this work of the light is! 
Then we  see  that  light travels as  radiation from each point of the 
object on which the light falls and  the different rays vibrating from the 
60 

different points stay separate and do not mix. I will explain. I see a tree 
from 
far away and I see it as a shapeless volume. Yet these different 
rays reach me and I can see through binoculars all the rays separate as 
if I were at a closer distance. If I can separate them by means of binoc­
ulars, I see the vibrating rays one next to the other, as if I was at such 
a distance that the light coming from the tree had the distance of this 
radiation from one to the other at that point. 
One day you should study and think about this. 
As soon as I have seen that tree, I wish to know more about it. This 
starts to create within me an interest. This INTEREST around a thought -
is it not a subconscious way towards other thoughts, which are again the 
product of Mind? They necessitate a certain way or method of research 
and analysis. What is this? They are lower vibrations of the psychical 
body. 
We shall look at it in a different way. I  go closer in order to know the 
tree, to know it with the sense of touch. I go closer and touch the tree. 
But pay attention, what happens if I do not go closer to the tree (or any 
object that I want to know), but instead simply take the image, the pic­
ture (of the tree), which is in my eyes and in the end gives a  stimulus to 
the optic nerve and on a certain brain centre (NOT of the GROSS material 
brain). What am I investigating - that object (that tree), or that image, 
which I have not yet converted into a thought? Because thought will 
occur when I start to concentrate on that image, meditate on it, make 
regular contemplation, in order to know the object. 
But on what  do I concentrate?  On that image?  On the stimulus 
within me? Or on the tree? 
When I said that you do not know what thought is, maybe you disa­
greed or you even got angry. But now I ask you again, have you analyzed 
the question and do you know what thought is? 
What do you think? Are we investigating the image in form of the vib­
ration (not the image itself), the vibration which gave rise to the image 
and the stimulus on the optic nerve within the brain? Or the tree? I can 
say, both. Because without realizing it, we are extended into the ether 
of that place and that environment. And now, what are we investigating? 
The image and the vibration: We are there. 
Tomorrow, when you will see and study an object, you will realize 
that really you are investigating the image, but you will also feel, that 
you are there and you know it. It is like being in the object and later 
y
ou will learn how to extend the thought into the object. Or you 
will 
Words of Truth I Chapter 7 
61 

see through attunement that the Mind Supersubstance has marvellous 
qualities, many more than what you know and make use  of. You  will 
see that thought is something much more than what you call thought 
today. 
We have  studied how  thought occurs, how  it  is  created. I  know 
subconsciously and I say that "I am and I exist", I am the thinker, the 
one who meditates and who receives impressions of the different things 
around me. 
Later we will  study  - through thinking again - that  self  of ours, 
which is called self-awareness. We will investigate this self fully. 
Can we say that  Mind is  a mirror; a noetic, a noetical, a psycho­
noetical mirror, on which we will see whatever we wish?  Not through 
the light we know around us,  but through the  noetical and psychical 
light. And when we investigate our self we shall see that we, as beings, 
are far more than what we may think we are - only a poor personality. 
No, we are something very, very great. 
We, as beings, can finally use Mind at will, consciously not subcon­
sciously, or mechanically,  as before. Are we aware of this? 
As I said,  Mind is a noetic, noetical and psychonoetical mirror, on 
which we can concentrate to search and to know everything. Can we 
thus even know ourselves? Yes, of course. 
Now we have approached the so-called Mind before it even took the 
form of thought. In this state it is elusive, unexpressed, until we form it 
into a specific thought. We cannot deny its existence as long as we draw 
from this Supersubstance, which allows us to form thought. 
Some say that thought is the product of the gross material brain. 
There is nothing more stupid. Even the scientists, who used to say that, 
have now rejected it. 
If I do not form the Mind as thought, I enter in such a state that 
I no longer receive impressions. Perhaps I will reach this state in deep 
sleep. Yet, after a few hours, when I awake, I can be whole and ready to 
use Mind and form it again, to draw from my subconscious self pictures 
and events from the past. And I wonder, the hours that I call oblivion, 
forgetting, - where did they exist - all those thoughts, which now I draw 
up as memory?  Because if they had not existed during all this time, how 
could  they  have been  recreated? If it  were not  for this phenomenon, 
how could we know our self as a personality self-awareness, how could 
we understand our present-day-personality self-awareness, full and in­
tact.  We have been  for a certain period of time,  for some hours, in a 
62 

state, which we call sleep, deep sleep, and we have entered a state of 
non-existence. Yet, afterwards we are whole again, when we awake, and 
we are who we were before. 
When we investigate this, we start to analyze our self as a personal­
ity in order to see from where after a deep sleep we draw this perfect 
system to know that "I am  I" with my  emotions, desires, weaknesses, 
imperfections and my way of thinking, and so on. 
No-one goes to sleep and wakes up as an angel, or goes to sleep as a 
criminal and wakes up as a good man. It is all a matter of evolution, and 
we have to investigate it. 
What are you as a self-aware being without thinking? 
This is something you must think about, because when you will get 
the answer and know it empirically, then you will understand that each 
one of us as an inner self is a divine being, eternal, uncha11geable, un­
touched by the phenomenon we call death. From that moment we can, 
through meditation, begin the investigation of the state we  call death 
and be convinced that death does not exist. 
We  can even investigate the state in which we are without thinking. 
There is a way to enter this state, in which we acknowledge that we are 
complete, but without thinking. We do not express our self outwards, 
neither do we receive impressions from the outside. 
Of course, all this is difficult for you to understand at the moment. 
Many  meditations are  necessary,  a  great  degree of  introspection and 
investigation into many fields. 
And I ask you, how will you investigate all these things if you do not 
use the Supersubstance of Mind as wise thought now? When I say "wise 
thought", what do I mea.n? 
Light gives us  the presence of this or that object. If I concentrate on the 
light, I will be fully aware of the things that are illuminated by the light. 
Accordingly, when I start to become aware of this and that state in 
introspection, when more noetical light (and much later noetic light) is 
shed and I start being focussed through introspection and investigation, 
I will know more fully things, which I did not know before, for the simple 
reason that I did not show interest and I was not focussed on them. Pay 
attention to this phrase, "To  BE  FOCUSSED.
" 
Therefore, fixing one's attention on something is a necessary pre­
condition, if we want to know more fully. 
Fixing one's attention or focussing. Who will be fixing his attention? 
Where will he or she fix his or her attention? By what means will the 
Words of Truth I Chapter 7 
63 

attention be fixed? All this will be investigated. And how will we investi­
gate? Again with thought. 
Therefore we are going.round and round in circles and  we see that 
we are constantly using the same Supersubstance. From the  same Su­
persubstance we are building our  self, our  self-awareness and our per­
sonality.  And, at  the  end, from the  same substance are  built the  dirty 
rags in which we  are  dressed at this moment. And also from the  same 
Supersubstance will be the indescribably beautiful light, the  luminous 
garment, in which we will be dressed as Soul-Self-awareness. Pay atten­
tion to this detail. 
Consequently,  our  search is  within the  Mind and our  capability 
to form Mind into thoughts, which will serve us. Thoughts as mirrors, 
within which we will see this and that, which we must know. 
This is at the beginning. Later we will enter another state, another 
way of research. We will not fix our  attention on any object, we  will be 
separate from the  object and we  must know it.  That means, we  gain 
knowledge about the object again through Supersubstance of  Mind, but 
in another more marvellous way: We will be able to become one with any 
object or  thing and then be able to  fix  our attention on  it.  We call this 
at-one-ment. At-one-ment does not lead to knowledge. At the beginning 
we  can  call  it  attunement and afterwards  at-one-ment, proceeding to 
Wisdom. Wisdom is  not  knowledge, but  knowledge leads to  wisdom. 
However, wisdom is not knowledge. 
How will knowledge be gained now, not by observing this or that and 
understanding this or  that from an  imperfect side, but  by assimilation, 
which is a capacity beyond time and space. 
What do we mean, when we say time and space? 
You would like to get acquainted with a tree; it does not matter how 
far away it  is  from you. Whether you  see  it with your material eyes or 
not, the tree exists. And there exists also another light, beyond the ordin­
ary usual light, which will give you the perception of the existence of the 
tree, provided you can be attuned to the vibrations, which the tree emits 
and  which are beyond the light. 
The researcher of the  truth must be  able to  use  this method. For 
example, the  researcher who is  now here must be  able to  investigate 
a  plant he has never known, nor read about in  an  encyclopaedia. The 
plant may exist in the Amazon or anywhere else. It  is enough to  be  at­
tuned to it and get the vibration, which this object (the plant) emits. It 
does not  matter how many thousands of miles it is from him. 
64 

This is  another kind of  radiation, noetic and  noetical. It  is called 
noetical light. It will come to his perception, but when he reaches this 
point, he will be able to attune himself to the object. To attune does not 
mean to know the object just as the light shows the surface and only the 
surface, on which the light falls before it returns to the eyes. But to at­
tune means to enter in the object beyond time and space. 
Space does not exist, since we can get this perception. 
Time? We will not need time to study one by one the points, because 
through at-one-ment in  an  instant, before we  close our eyes and  open 
them again, we will  know anything about this  plant, which a biologist 
could not know even if he studied for a hundred years. 
And again, all this through Mind, but a  different form of thought. 
This is also thought, but pay attention to the difference. How different 
is this thought from what you know as thought? 
Now, how we  will  use, later on,  the  Supersubstance of  Mind in 
another form to receive impressions as  Superconscious self-awareness 
and not as a conscious self-aware personality,  but as a Soul - this will be 
something, which you will know in the future. 
Enlarging your capabilities, you will see that it is not your capabilit­
ies  that  are growing, but  it is the fuller perception of the greatness of 
what you are - you as your inner Self.

CHAPTER 8 
Healing, Etheric Vita_lity, Psychical Healing, Spiritual Healing 
What is psychotherapy? Psychotherapy is the wrong word. It is derived 
from the Greek word "psyche" which means Soul. The Soul is God and 
it needs no therapy. 
Many healers claim to be healers. This again is wrong. No human 
being should claim to be a healer. The Holy Spirit is doing the healing. 
Human beings are instruments, the means in the ·hands of the  Holy 
Spirit and the holy Archangels of the elements. They cause the phenom­
enon we call healing. 
Even Christ, who was perfect God and perfect man, said when he 
spoke as the Son of Man "I can of my own self do nothing" and he added 
that it was the God in him who was doing the work. So it is a great hon­
our for the so-called healer to be used by the holy Intelligences and the 
Holy Spirit in this work, in this holy work. 
We can divide the so-called healers into two categories: the psychic­
al healers and the spiritual healers. The psychical healers are mainly 
working with the etheric vitality while the spiritual healer raises his con­
sciousness to the at-one-ment in the Common Selfhood. 
We shall first concentrate on the psychical healing. We have ob­
served and we have learnt that the human body has a kind of electro­
magnetic energy in it.  We call it etheric vitality. A  healer must know 
what it is, how to get it, how to keep it and how to dispose of it. 
Even orthodox science acknowledges the existence of this energy. 
Mesmer, who lived from 1734 to 1815, had discovered an energy which 
he called "animal magnetism". 
So, in and around our material body is this energy we call etheric 
vitality. It is our daily bread given by God. We ask him to give us this day 
our daily bread. This vital energy is our daily bread. Or as Christ said 
"I am the bread of life", that is, the energy is the expression of Christ 
66 

Himself. Therefore we have to consider this energy as holy, as holy as 
the material body is. 
Most of the so-called healers use this energy subconsciously, espe­
cially  if their personality is not fully  developed. They  succeed or they 
don't succeed and they don't know why. We should learn to use this en­
ergy consciously and therefore we have to know more about this energy. 
ETHERIC VITALITY is  keeping the material body  alive  and  in  good 
health. It is everywhere in us and around us. It can be obtained by breath­
ing, eating and some other ways of assimilation from the worlds of other 
dimensions. This energy in and around our material body is what we call 
the  etheric  double. The storehouse of  this  energy is the  solar plexus. 
Christ spoke about this energy. A woman believed that she would 
be healed by  simply touching his garment; she  touched him  and  was 
healed. Faith is a great,  great power. Christ said "Who  touched me?  I 
felt energy going out of my body, out of me." 
And on another occasion Christ said:  "He that believes on me,  as 
the scripture said, out of his belly  shall flow rivers of living water." This 
is the Gospel of St. John. What is that "rivers of living water coming out 
of his belly"? That is the vital energy coming out of the solar plexus. 
We  should know that  we  are given certain quantities of this vital 
energy by the Almighty Intelligence every day, every  day. And what are 
we  doing? We are exhausting this energy, by  burning it. As a vehicle, 
a motor car, is in need of petrol to move about, a human body  needs 
vital  energy to live.  Now  suppose you  are  given 100 units  of  energy 
every day. 40 units are needed by the holy Archangels of the elements to 
sustain the material body and keep it in good health. Another 40 units 
are needed by us to move around, to think, to live, energy used just for 
ourselves. And there remain another 20 units to dispose of. But what are 
we, human beings, doing? We are burning, using or rather abusing, let 
us say, 80 units or more, and therefore spending more than we get. So 
the material body is deprived of this energy and illness will appear. What 
is 
burning this energy? A fit of anger is burning a lot of energy. Keeping 
within yourself negative feelings, emotions, jealousy, hatred and enmity 
will  continuously burn energy. In 80% of  the cases  the illness is the 
patients' fault. The situation is different if a person is shouldering the 
burdens of others i.e. if he is willing to pay the bills which others would 
have had to pay. 
Is a psychotherapist expending part of his own energy when he heals, 
so that he will be tired at the end of the day? N o, he spends nothing of 
Words of Truth I Chapter 8 
67 

his own. HE is not doing the healing, it is the Holy Spirit and the holy 
Archangels who use the psychotherapist as a channel. If the psycho­
therapist really  loves  humanity,  really  loves  God  and  has  full  under­
standing, he can heal hundreds a day without being exhausted. Every 
person who makes strong loving elementals, believing and wishing that 
the patient become well, will help in the healing process. 
Now HOW  WILL  A  PATIENT BE  HEALED? We will give him  etheric 
vitality. And that etheric vitality will do the thing.  But we can also co­
operate with the holy Archangels by using what we could call  higher 
powers: visualization, creative visualization, even materialization or de­
materialization. Are WE doing that? We are doing nothing. We are doing 
what is God's, not ours. Because even our bodies are not ours, even our 
personalities are not ours. Everything is from  the Absolute Authority and 
everything is to honour the Absolute Reality. 
Nowadays, many psychotherapists, believing themselves that they 
can heal people, make their subconsciousness release this energy to the 
patients. They believe that by touching with their hands they pass this 
energy from their body to the patients. Of course, success depends upon 
the depth of their belief. Faith counts. But they are not giving anything 
of their own. The real healers are the Logos, the Holy Spirit and mother 
nature in which the Logos is omnipresent. Even if the healer does not 
interfere, a wound on  a leg,  for instance, may heal "by itself',  by na­
ture. 
A so-called psychical healer should know the nature of the etheric 
double and the nature of the vital energy. He must learn how to store it 
in the etheric double of the material body  and keep his etheric double 
always full to overflowing. He should know how to attune himself to the 
storehouse of energy. To do this he must train himself getting to know 
his subconscious, cleaning the subconscious, knowing how to re-ener­
gize healing elementals and help to cast out from the patients the el­
ementals causing illness. It is a training that needs many, many years of 
meditation, concentration, visualization, dealing with the subconscious­
ness and the vital energy. We should be able to use self-consciously the 
etheric double and the etheric vitality in the same way that everyone is 
making use of his hands. These are the lessons we are teaching all the 
time ...  not only for those who want to become so-called psychothera­
pists, but for the spiritual upliftment of everyone. 
One way of training ourselves in the use of the etheric double is to 
learn how to make the light balls in absent healing. 
68 

From observation and experience we know that loving your patient 
and wishing that he become healthy will create an elemental which fac­
ilitates the flow of the etheric vitality from your body to  the patient. 
Joshua Immanuel the Christ was teaching his disciples the art of 
healing. How to make their bodies, or rather the etheric doubles of their 
bodies overfull with this energy by certain  exercises: breathing exer­
cises, concentrating on this etheric vitality,  and, of course, believing and 
being trained in  visualization. All around us  is not only air and what sci­
ence calls oxygen.  There is  also etheric vitality. We think this is  a  good 
word: "etheric" is  giving us the nature of it; "vitality" tells us what it  is. 
Is this energy thought? It is also thought.  It  has in it its own intelligence. 
That is  why the elementals which are built of  this etheric vitality have 
their intelligence - yours and theirs also.  That is why we call the energy 
LIVING, etheric vitality. Vitality gives life. So elementals have their own 
intelligence, their own way of  life. And we said the sum total of  these 
elementals, good and bad, all made of  the etheric vitality,  compose our 
personality a_nd that part of  our human nature called subconsciousness. 
But the subconsciousness, which is  made up of  etheric vitality,  is 
not  only the subconscious behaviour of  our personality,  it  is  also the 
storehouse of  the energy. This etheric vitality can be seen in  certain 
states, ways of being and existing. It is psychical vitality and it is noetic­
al  vitality.  By introspection you can observe and find out: I can use this 
etheric vitality in thinking, in  feeling and in  acting. This happens in 
the three lower worlds - the material world, by getting up, walking, 
working, doing this and that. This action is  on the physical plane, us­
ing the material body. We also have the acting on the psychical plane if 
we get the skill of  using our psychical body subconsciously. And wh�n 
you reach the stage of  using the Mind GOnsciously,  you are doing it  in 
the noetical plane. That is  why we have separate etheric do'ubles - the 
etheric double of  the material body, the etheric double of the psychical 
body,  the etheric double of  the noetical body. We should learn to  be 
consciously in touch with them. And developing our consciousness to 
be self-consciously in touch with them means that the self, now, will be 
our Soul ego, and not the personality (the egoism, the sum total of  the 
elementals). 
A 
good psychotherapist should have a  thorough knowledge of  the 
ANATOMY of  the material body. There are many good books on the hu­
man anatomy. He should know the organs of the material body,  how they 
function 
using the etheric vitality of the etheric double.  He should be 
Words of Trnth I Chapter 8 
69 

able to  find out the causes of the illness. Cooperate with a medical doc­
tor, if necessary. A   detailed knowledge of all the qualities of  the etheric 
double is a must. 
A psychotherapist should get the training needed to KNOW THE SUB­
CONSCIOUS part of the personality, because all the illnesses of the mater­
ial body are coming from the subconscious. What is needed is a proper 
psychoanalysis, the way we  understand this term. While one material 
body resembles another material body,  the personalities are all different 
and their needs differ from case to  case. 
First rule: approach your patient not as a psychotherapist or a doctor 
but as a loving friend. Try to create confidence in that person. Pills and 
tablets are normally coated with sugar. Your treatment should be coated 
with the sweetness of  love and compassion. Make friends with the pa­
tient, make some jokes. Usually people suffering from psychosomatic 
illnesses  become very negative, they become the victim of their subcon­
sciousness; they may repeat and repeat the same ... A  psychotherapist, 
showing love and friendship to  his  patient, must allow him to  talk. He 
should not interfere, not say anything, but be  concentrated and listen 
very carefully in  order to  find the cause of  the illness. Do  not guess but 
study each case carefully.  No two persons have the same case, the same 
way of thinking, the same way of  feeling. 
Be  careful what you say.  Sometimes a  silent suggestion, without 
talking, will help to make the patient think for himself. Everything sug­
gested may become auto-suggestion in  the patient. The subconscious 
mind of someone may become his good friend or his worst enemy open­
ing his grave. 
A good psychotherapist needs the cooperation of the holy Archang­
els. He should know them, contact them self-consciously and cooperate 
with them. When Joshua Immanuel the Christ was healing, he  took 
away from the people the guilt. "Your sins are forgiven. Sin no  more." 
The  patient has to believe that his sins are  forgiven. 
Joshua Immanuel the Christ had with him Yacoub, Yohannan and 
Petros when he  had difficult healing work to  do  or  when he  was rais­
ing the dead. Why? They were the disciples who could best help and 
assist him. So  a  psychotherapist needs cooperation. A friend, a  good 
helper can assist the psychotherapist with good elementals. Every good 
thought will help that the etheric vitality passes to  the patient. Why do 
we start the lesson with a prayer? What is a prayer? A strongArchangelic 
elemental can change a negative atmosphere. 
70 

What is now SPIRITUAL HEALING? Who is a spiritual healer? He  or 
she  who  has  trained  himself or herself for  many, many centuries and 
has come to the world with a heart belonging to the Logos, shining only 
love for everybody.  By attunement to the Logos, he can work directly by 
strong VISUALIZATION, LOVE AND WILLPOWER. In this case he can deal 
with  the  elements with  the  permission of  the  Archangels of the  ele­
ments and use what we call materialization and de-materialization. But 
again, it is the Christ who is doing the work through him, not the healer. 
Even  a  spiritual  healer must  not  present himself as  a  healer, but  he 
should rather feel honoured to be the channel for the divine plan. This 
means that nobody can be a good so-called healer or a spiritual  healer 
unless the egoism of his personality has been completely annihilated. 
Since a spiritual healer is  cooperating with the  Holy Spirit he can 
act with authority. He can feel the presence of the Holy S'Pirit in himself 
and he can say 
"
WE have done it, the Holy Spirit and I", the "I" being his 
Ego-Soul and not his personal egoism. 
Was  Jos�ua  Immanuel the  Christ preparing psychical healers or 
spiritual healers when he taught his disciples? Both. According to their 
capacity, because all of them could not  be spiritual healers, but nearly 
all of them could be psychical healers. They had to be able to store in 
their etheric doubles this energy, keep it and pass it over for  the  Holy 
Spirit and the holy Archangels working in the bodies to use. 
The  first  thing  a  psychical healer has  to  learn  is  breathing, the 
healthy and good way of breathing. 3 beats of the heart inhaling and 3 
beats of the heart out. 4 beats of the heart inhaling and 4 beats of the 
heart exhaling. 6 beats of the heart inhaling and 6 beats of the heart ex­
haling. Most other systems of breathing which are used in the East are 
dangerous. 
• 
You do not only fill your lungs but the whole etheric double. How? 
In breathing we have to feel,  by concentrating and visualizing colours, 
how the etheric vitality is passed through the body and stored in the eth­
eric double.  We are working with what we call the feeling giving ether 
or the aesthetic ether. However, if you wish to enrich the etheric double 
of the psychical body  you  have to BREATHE THROUGH EVERY PORE OF 
THE  SKIN. We all do it subconsciously, but we have to learn to do it con­
sciously, by observation. 
A good psychic healer can  by VISUALIZATION -not  imagination or 
fantasy - make forms, any forms he  likes,  from the  formless Super­
substance of  Mind which is the breath of the  Holy  Spirit. We have to 
Words of Truth I Chapter 8 
71 

understand that we get nothing "just like that";  we  get  it  all from the 
Holy Spirit. And the  Logos? )'es, if we are doing it self-consciously we 
get it from the Logos. We teach in our lessons that the characteristic of 
the Logos is self-consciousness; the characteristic of the  Holy Spirit is 
consciousness. In other words, the Holy Spirit is doing the work on the 
material body AS A BODY, on the psychical body as  A BODY, and on the 
noetical body AS A  BODY.  And  the  Logos is  developing your SELF-con­
sciousness to USE THE  BODIES. We have to develop the self-conscious­
ness to higher levels with the Superconsciousness of the Spirit. 
A psychical healer has to learn to control his emotions, desires and 
the storms in the personality.  Introspection and meditation are serving 
us to gain control. We must gain control from above, that means from 
the psychical plane. We always control the lower plane from the higher 
plane. Note that you cannot control the material plane and the etheric 
vitality of the material plane just from the level of the material etheric 
vitality. You must work from the higher plane. That means, silencing and 
controlling the emotions, because they are burning this etheric vitality 
of the material body. You can control the psychical plane and the materi­
al plane from the noetical world. This is how we are doing our exercises 
in introspection.  Coming from the higher to the lower, we  are feeling 
the aesthetic ether. This is one of the four kinds of etheric energy. The 
aesthetic ether gives us the feeling that we are living. Living means that 
we are using subconsciously that aesthetic ether.  Now we have to start 
using it consciously and self-consciously. It is by means of this aesthetic 
vitality that we will  build up our real  self-consciousness, even on the 
lower planes. 
A good psychotherapist will act at least as Ego-Soul conscious being, 
controlling the emotions and the thoughts he or she expresses. Which 
means that he or she has to annihilate the egoism completely from his 
or her personality.  Even if that egoism presents itself as pure and good. 
Joshua Immanuel the Christ said, beware, the tempter appears even as 
an angel of light.  Egoism is egoism. 
An illness may  first  appear as  reflection on  the  psychical body.  It 
does 
not affect the psychical body, but it appears on the etheric double 
of the psychical body. And then by reflection it goes to the etheric dou­
ble of the material body.  Passing through the etheric double which will 
never get ill. 
The 
main  CAUSE OF ILLNESS is  dissatisfaction.  Dissatisfaction is 
slowly, slowly developing from  desires which have  not  been  fulfilled. 
72 

You have to make the patient understand what desires are. Why do they 
cause so much harm? The mere fact that some desire has not been ful­
filled? What is the real cause of his or her troubles? 
Dissatisfaction is IN  THE  PERSONALilY. Spirit and Soul are  God. 
They need no treatment. But the personality is a human being having a 
material body, an often uncontrolled psychical body and an often uncont­
rolled noetical body. The personality is the sum total of its  elementals, 
very often mixed up. 
The psychotherapist should look at the emotional and the thinking 
process and make thought master not servant of the emotions. 
The whole cause of every kind of illness is the  emotional side. You 
must know how it works. That is why we said, dissatisfaction is  in  the 
personality. Explain to your patient, why it was wrong to be dissatisfied. 
It needs patience. Teach him, make him understand. Exp1ain the nature 
of his personality. If he changes his character, he is not so egoistic. Make 
him behave in a different way. Be more understanding. Teach him how 
to  work witl:! good elementals; call them good thoughts, good think­
ing, good emotions. While the material body can be healed by  the  Holy 
Spirit and the Archangels, the personality has to be healed  (changed) by 
the patient himself.

CHAPTER 9 
Life, Kinesis, God is  Life, Who am I?,Mind, Bodies, 
Personality, Elementals, Self-Realization 
If someone asked "What is life?", everyone would immediately say,  "I 
know what life is."  But,  do you really know what life is? If you  know 
what life is, then you know what God is!  So I ask again "What is life?" 
And the answer is:  Life is incomprehensible Beingness. It is and exists. 
Being and existing are two different states. "Being" is eternal, without a 
beginning and without an end, in the eternal now. In eternity it is always 
"now". We must try to understand the eternal now. 
Now, I ask you again  "What is life?" What you think you know is 
the phenomenon of life. And even that phenomenon, you do not know 
it properly. You can say "I live". Yes. But I can say that you are not the 
only living being. Look around you!  Billions of phenomena of life, living 
forms. Of course, looking around us with our material eyes we see the 
phenomena of life. What about looking at a drop of water through a mi­
croscope. What will you see in that drop of water? Life, i.e. phenomena 
of life. The orthodox science has found out that everywhere there are 
phenomena of life. They call them microbes and viruses. In time, they 
found out that with stronger microscopes, electronic microscopes, they 
can  see  even  smaller phenomena of life. And  what  is the  main  char­
acteristic of life?  Kinesis - movement, motion, vibration. Nobody can 
understand life except through kinesis (or vibration). 
What is orthodox science doing today? It is searching on the mater­
ial plane, using material means, trying Lo  find  the truth.  What part  of 
the truth has orthodox science found until now? Two things. Everything 
existing must have a form. Kinesis (movement or vibration) is the princ­
iple governing the living forms. This is definitely so, but it is only part of 
the 
truth. It is the relative truth, the absolute truth is still hidden. Every 
p
henomenon of life has a cause which brought it into existence. Ortho­
do
x science has begun to study what life is. They examine the phenom-
74 

ena of life, they are trying to find out what a material body of a man or an 
animal 
is, by making use of the five senses and with certain instruments. 
We cannot say �hat what they have achieved is not great. It is. We should 
admire the work of these orthodox  scientists, but ... there is much more 
to learn. They have to realize that a  living form is a  phenomenon of life 
and not life itself. A phenomenon of life is actually an expression of life. 
What is life, now? We should not only concentrate on the phenom­
ena of life and their characteristics: kinesis, or motion. We must see 
more clearly. Is life, beyond the phenomena of life, intelligent? What is 
intelligence? You can call a  man intelligent when he can use his mind 
thinking properly and understand the relative truth. But this kind of 
intelligence is only an expression of the phenomenon of life. It is very 
limited and often wrong. Every intelligent man may make mistakes. On 
the other  hand, is the so-called Absolute Intelligence ma'king mistakes? 
Looking at all the phenomena of life around us, from the amoeba to the 
galaxy, we find order. We find that all the phenomena of life obey a  cert­
ain law,  the @w of possibilities. No phenomenon of life can escape the 
law of possibilities. What else can we see? With the law of possibilities 
we see the Almightiness.  We see the Almightiness of the Logos in every 
expression as a phenomenon of life. This is definite. In the circle of pos­
sibilities for every phenomenon of life we see the divine Intelligence and 
Its Almightiness. Nothing can escape from it. 
What is this divine Intelligence and Its Almightiness? Is it not God? 
How can we imagine God to exist in the world of existence? As Life. God 
is Life. Now, I ask you "Do you know what Life is?'' Simply observing and 
studying the phenomenl! of life (they are living, moving, growing, present­
ing themselves in what we call time, in the worlds of existence, with ab�­
ginning and an end) can you know what life is? No, only the characteristics 
of the phenomena of l.ife. By observation, concentration and' meditation 
you can know much, much concerning the phenomena of life all around 
you. This is what the orthodox science is doing, using material instruments. 
But if I ask you, "Can any phenomenon of life exist unless it has a source? 
Can you imagine that something moves without a source of energy?" 
So, we must have a  source. Though Life is incomprehensible -to 
the material brain, of course -it does not mean that you cannot know 
what life is. However,  you as a  human being cannot understand it. But 
f
or you as Life, i.e. if you know that you are Life, it will be possible to 
know what life is. First, you must realize what you are as Life. You, your­
self, must find your Self-Superconsciousness. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 9 
75 

Christ said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing." 
And he said, "God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship 
in spirit and truth". Spirit and Truth are the same. So, in the Gospel, in 
the sayings of the God-man, Joshua the Christ, is all the knowledge and 
all the wisdom. But you must understand the meaning of the teaching. 
Is it only Christ who said that? All wise men and teachers of the past 
approached the Truth in some way. They spoke about it maybe in a  dif­
ferent way -but they all knew the Truth. 
You may ask, "Is Absolute Beingness God? Where can I  find Him?" 
Many centuries ago, thousands of years before the birth of Christ, hu­
man beings were already searching for this Truth. Why? Because they 
felt the need to get an answer to the questions "Who are we? What are 
we?" You cannot get the answer unless you know what God is. 
Thousands of years ago, the human beings in their search started to 
think, "What is the relationship between men and animals, and why should 
men worship animals as gods?" They made that mistake. The Ancient 
Egyptians were adoring certain animals as gods, for example Anubis. It 
did not satisfy them, however. How had they come to the point of adoring 
animals as gods? Because they saw them living and expressing strength. 
And, instead of understanding the meaning of the phenomenon of life, 
they simply recognized the shape and form of them. That was a mistake. 
They worshipped many animal gods until one day a  Hierophant felt 
that this practice should stop. He asked himself why the sun should be 
adored as Amon Ra. He started to think about life, why we are living and 
how we live. Amenophis the Fourth got new insight in a state of ecstasy. 
His nephew Khor Amon, also a Hierophant, agreed with him and to­
gether they denounced the many animal gods and even Amon Ra. They 
said "God is Life, infinite Life." Instead of Amon Ra they adored Aton, 
the one and only God, the Incomprehensible. In the old Egyptian lan­
guage Aton meant "incomprehensible". Amenophis gave himself a  new 
name: "Ankh-en-Aton" (the one beloved by Aton) and Khor Amon was 
to be known as "Khor  Aton". 
They declared a new system of worship -worshipping Aton, the one 
God, being everywhere, giving light and heat to the sun and life to the 
human beings and the animals. But the world was not ready for that. 
The High Priests of Amon Ra, Anubis and the other gods did not want 
to lose their importance and revenue. So they killed both; Khor Aton, by 
stabbing him to death, and Ankh-en-Aton by poison. This is what always 
happens to the pioneers who reveal the Truth. 
76 

If you study ancient civilisations you find many similar stories, e.g. 
in the history of the Aztecs, the Incas, and the Hindus. Ankh-en-Aton, 
in ecstasy, revealed the Truth and said "I feel Aton within me, talking to 
me" (as Super Intelligence). 
What about Lord Buddha in India? Having been in a state of ecstasy, he 
said to his disciples, "Searching for years to find God, I found him after all." 
"Where is it, Master?", his disciple asked.And his answer was, "within us". 
So, what is Life? We have said, Life is God. By the word God, we 
minimize this Absolute Beingness to our measure. And, our measure is 
not a good one because we adore material things as God. Though we do 
not justice to Absolute Beingness by calling it God, we must use that 
word because it means something to our human intelligence. Yet, we 
must see God in Spirit. Remember what Christ said, "God is Spirit, and 
those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth"� 
Now the question arises "How?" Yes, you say, God is Spirit. But I 
ask you, "What are you? Material body only? Nothing more?" Let me tell 
you, "You are God! You are also Spirit. You are a Spirit-Soul expressing 
yourself as a personality.'' Now you come to the point of analyzing "What 
am I? Who am I?" Just try to find out who you are. This is the aim of 
the researchers of the truth, this is serious research. But, you cannot 
approach the Truth unless you ascend the ladder of the relative truth. It 
is not so easy to get to the real meaning of Truth. 
How shall we start working to find the Truth? What is the Truth? 
Of course, we know the relative truth. We know the relative truth about 
things in time and place-space by comparison. This is the relative truth 
about things and conditions in life, where you say that "this in comp­
arison to that" is not true. This is the relative truth. What is the real 
Truth behind all the phenomena of life? And how can you find it? By try­
ing to understand it. What will you find out? "I am a different·being from 
the animals all around ·me." Use observation and through it you will start 
with concentration and meditation. Meditation? Thinking about some­
thing over and over again, until you reach a conclusion. Concentration? 
Unless you are a master of concentration, how will you fix your attention 
and continue meditating? These two skills we should learn, concentra­
tion and meditation. You use these words many times and you find them 
in many books. Analyze everything and make sure that you know the
. 
real 
meaning in everythin
.
g. 
So,  one should,  first of all,  master -concentration and meditation. 
Then we come to anot)ier point. "Who meditates? My human brain? My 
Words  of Truth I Cha

body? Is my body meditating? What are the means I use to meditate?" 
Then you approach the Mind: And I ask you, "What is the Mind?" You 
are using it subconsciously every day, every moment, yet - you do not 
know what the Mind is. Through concentration, meditation and obser­
vation you will find the nature of  Mind.  What is this Mind? We have 
different names: intelligence, .perception, sensitivity, emotions. These 
are the expressions of the Mind in the phenomena of life. But we have 
to find out what the Mind really is. What have seekers for centuries and 
centuries, and even now, found out concerning Mind? Mind is every­
thing.  Mind is the  Supersubstance, formless, becoming substance to 
take form and becoming matter. Matter is Mind solid. Not even an atom 
of matter can exist unless it has Mind in it. Everything is Mind. Are our 
material bodies Mind? Definitely, and they have their own way 'of   living 
and existing apart from your intelligence. You are living  in a material 
body, you know very little about or nothing at all. Yet, the material body 
is living properly. By itself? Phenomenically -yes, by itself, but in reality 
it is not so. It is cared for by other, higher Archangelic Intelligences, the 
Lords of the elements. 
Can we find practical proof of this? This is the aim of the research. 
Of course you can, but it needs time to exercise, to master the Mind. 
Because through the Mind as a mirror you will see the Truth reflected 
as its images. Where does research end? Nowhere. You will search and 
search for centuries and you will still have more to search. There is no 
end. 
How many years must you study? In seven years one can get a di­
ploma as a doctor of medicine. How many years should you study these 
things? 
Years? I say, centuries! Studying and studying you find more and 
more concerning the Truth  which is  Life.  But one should be  sincere 
with himself or herself. "Do I really want to know the Truth? Or, am I 
satisfied living as I am living now, in a material body. A  body that I do 
not know while others -the Archangels of Creation -are taking care of 
it. Do I really want to live in poor conditions, not very different from the 
life of the animals all around me?" How many people are living just like 
that? Many. They live under drives and urges of sex, hunger and many 
more, just like animals. But this is not proper for human beings. We are 
not animals. Our nature is to  use the Super-Intelligence of Mind and 
find the real Self -what are we? 
We should start our search at the lowest level. What is the mate­
rial body I am living in? Is it mine or do I just live in it by the Grace of 
78 

the Infinite Intelligence? What did  Christ say about this body of mine? 
" 
... the very hairs of your head are all numbered." Do you know the mat­
erial body you are living in? The orthodox  science tries to know more 
and  more  by  investigation. Of  course, they  have  succeeded to  learn 
much about  muscles, the  bones,  the constitution, the working of the 
glands, the lungs, the  brain,  how the five senses are  functioning. The 
orthodox scien"Ce has learned much - in the wrong way. All these things 
were  already taking place  in  the  bodies of  the  cavemen. Who  cared 
about their bodies? They did not. They were only living in their bodies, 
the same way you are living in your body now. Caring? How much do you 
care about your body? Taking food? We did not make the food - we find 
it ready,  created, say by nature (I say by God). You take it - that is all. 
What do you do for your material body besides taking a little food and 
washing it? Nothing. On the contrary, you are living a kintl of life which 
damages the material body. You are causing much damage, calling it ill­
ness. This is another field of research, beyond the orthodox science. The 
orthodox scie!1ce is slowly beginning to join the esoteric teachings. 
Why is one man immune to an illness and another is not? All around 
us  we have germs, viruses and  microbes - why  are  some immune to 
them? We know that it depends on the state of the etheric double of the 
material body. We know the nature of that body of energy, of electromag­
netic vitality. This is the real principle of life on earth, though not Life 
itself. 
If a medical doctor examines a dead body, he will notice that the life 
force is  no longer there in the body. We call it etheric vitality. But this 
is not the Source of Life, yet it is under the authority of the Source and 
of the holy Archangels. ·rt is the holy vitality - Mind vibrating at one of 
the lowest rates of vibration, a little above the rate of vibration of the 
material body. We have to know it and use it. 
So far, we have s�en that first we have to learn by exercise to use 
concentration and meditation. We have to develop our skill of concent­
ration and meditation. As a second step, we asked ourselves "What is 
this body of mine?" Now, we come to a further point. It is easy to touch 
our body. I move about with it. But now I ask myself: "Who is moving 
about?" The body is not moving by itself. "I" am moving it. "Who am I?" 
When I say,  I  am  awake, or I get out of bed,  I dress myself, I mean I 
dress my body, I  move my body. But who am I?" You will come to another 
way of thinking, realizing "I am a kind of personality. But what is that 'I 
am'? I am not my bod��" 
Words of Truth I Chapter 9 
79 

Then we start searching. Who am  I? This is more difficult than to 
study the material body. What am I? What are all those people around 
me,  in my  family, my  neighb�urs? We will find out that their material 
bodies are  all similar. Men have similar bodies to  all other  men and 
women to all other women. But am I the same as my neighbour,  as my 
brother or sister, as my parents? No, I am I! I see this "I" reflected in the 
mirror of matter in my   materiai body and its expressions. I am a person­
ality. Now comes the serious work. 
What am I as a personality? I say, I am living. I am living even while 
sleeping. I am living even in that period of time when I feel I am not 
existing, as if annihilated. I am recomposing myself the following morn­
ing. How is that? Where have I been during those hours of apparently 
dreamless life? What was that life? If that was really annihilation, how 
did I recompose myself the next morning and continue to be what I was 
before going to sleep? Am  I in the morning the same  person, i.e.  the 
same desires, same way of feeling, same liking and disliking, same way 
of living my life; in other words the same individuality?· 
Now, we have to search in two ways. How do others feel and behave 
and how do I feel and behave - and find common characteristics. The 
causes are common to all, the expressions are not. By thinking seriously, 
we find the  causes, the causes common to all:  desire. What  is  desire? 
The feeling of wanting to have something that came to my  notice. The 
will of possessing it, calling it mine. This is a common cause. What is it 
in my life? Why do I feel like this? 
With patience and sincerity, we have to observe the way we are feel­
ing and behaving. Why do we behave in a certain way? What is anger? 
What  is  enmity? What  are weaknesses? What  are  certain conditions 
which really shake me? Who am I now? And you may say  "Oh,  and I 
thought I knew myself as a personality." You find out that you have to 
study more that self of yours to find out who you really  are.  Now you 
start to use your etheric double as the imprinting ether, visualizing, us­
ing your  Mind, and studying the conditions of your life as a phenom­
enon of life. This is most important. 
Now, we study these ideas; but where does the energy come from? 
What is Mind? What is the formless Supersubstance which - in visuali­
zation - we now use to study things and conditions. Visualizing? Bring­
ing to the surface what has happened and seeing it -judging it. This is, 
of course, a  serious study. What is  Mind? What is the Supersubstance, 
formless, yet creating forms? Elementals. 
80 

Now we come to the question, "What are elementals? What are 
thought-forms? Can I see them?" At the beginning -no, but you can feel 
them. These elementals can be your torturers. When they become fixed 
ideas -as the psychologists call them -they really start to crush the per­
sonality. The fact that you cannot see them does not mean that they do not 
have a life of their own. Of course, elementals do not necessarily have to 
torture you. Good elementals, good thoughts, will help you. Therefore, 
instead of creating what we call devilish elementals (human demons), 
create angelic ones (human angels). Create more and more good element­
als. You have to learn how to do it. And when you de-energize an evil one, 
replace it with a  good one. Do not leave its place empty. This is an art 
that everyone has to master. The most important of the exercises - most 
people do not give much attention to it -is the introspection, looking 
within and analyzing that kind of self we now call our perstmality.  Look­
ing at it with sincerity and an open mind. So, there is much work to do. 
In our study we find the nature of our etheric double (which is 
electromagnetic) and we call it etheric vitality.  What do we find? In the 
Order of the Holy  Spirit  (the Super-Intelligence, dynamically) there  are 
holy Archangels, Lords of the elements. How do I  know  that  they exist? 
By studying the elements. By observing their creative work in the mater­
ial body through the etheric double. It is logical that behind it there are 
higher intelligences. And, by concentration and observation, developing 
the skill of visualization, one day you will see them. Then you will come 
in conscious contact with the Archangels. They want it. They would be 
happy about it -to know that, after all, you are able to appreciate the 
work they do for you, for your material and other bodies.  In the course of 
time, you will increase your skill and your power in visualization and you 
will gain what we call clairvoyance instead of seeing just with your eyes.' 
If you study continuously,   using observation, you come to know 
the nature of this etheric double of your body.  The holy Archangels are 
building and creating under the authority of the Holy Spirit. You will re­
alize that they are trying to persuade and teach you to help them in their 
work and you will hear them say "You call this body 'yours'. Why do you 
call it 'yours' if you do not take care of it yourself? We take care of it all 
the time, creating and repairing it." 
By observation you will find the nature of this etheric  double. And 
you will find that this etheric double -from each atom and molecule to 
each  organ and the whole  body-is a  mou-ld in which everything is creat­
ed in accordance with the circle of possibilities of each cell in you. You 
Words of Truth I Chapter 9 
81 

are wondering: "How is this work done Superconsciously in this body of 
mine without my knowing it? Whether I am awake or leave the body to 
sleep, whether I am aware o(my body or not, the Archangels repair its 
wounds and illnesses." 
This is serious study. But I insist, it needs observation - you have 
to be alert all the time. That means transferring your 1-ness from the 
subconscious state, in which most of you are now living,  to the self­
conscious state. That needs time and exercise. The result will be that 
you gain knowledge about your self as a present-day-personality. 
How can I find the real Self of my personality? By reflection. We 
can never understand what light is unless we have the reflected light 
from a mirror. In our case, we have a threefold mirror which distorts the 
reality. And in that mirror we see our self as an entity existing in time 
and place.  The threefold mirror is  Mind matter, Mind  as  emotional 
substance, and Mind as thought in its purer nature. I will explain: We 
can see ourselves reflected in this threefold mirror as our material body, 
as our psychical body  (emotion), and as our noetical· body (thought). 
See how distorted you see yourself in this threefold mirror. Especially 
seeing yourselves on the surface of the mirror which is the emotional 
side of your existence -the present-day-personality. What is real in the 
reflections within the mirror? Our 1-ness, our Ego. Standing in front of 
this mirror, you make the mistake to think that the reflection, the image 
in the mirror is your Self.  But if the mirror is broken (by death?), you 
will not see your reflection any more, yet, nothing happens to you. You 
are you - even without your reflection on that mirror. 
What do we find? That we as dormant and dreaming present-day 
self-consciousness have to wake up to the reality of who we are. As long 
as we are dreaming and under the time and place illusions we cannot 
see ourselves in introspection, in looking within. Looking within? Christ 
said that the Kingdom of the Heavens, which is in us, is our own nature. 
Christ said also that we should seek the Kingdom of the Heavens within 
us and everything will be added to us. And I wish to emphasize that all 
those things will come. So, keep in your minds, what is really worth hav­
ing is Self-Realization. 
Now, you can see yourself by introspection - from within. You can 
touch the reality to see who you really are. We have studied our reflect­
ions. We have learnt to use Mind consciously and reasonably. We have 
learnt to de-energize bad elementals and to create angelic elementals. 
In our introspection, in meditation, we ask ourselves "Who am I? What 
82 

am 
I?" If we do this with sincerity,  our Guardian Archangel will one day 
rev
eal to us our Real Self. 
You are Life, you are God, you are Spirit, a  Spirit-Soul expressing 
itself as a  personality. You are God, seeing your reflection as a  man or a 
woman. You live Life as God. Let me ask you some questions: "Where 
do you suppose you will go in what we call Self-realization? Moving in 
space? in place? Where is this Self-realization?" That Self-realization is 
everywhere and now. You are not going to return somewhere, away from 
where you are now. So, you are now, already,  in the Infinite Beingness. 
Some of you may think, "So, I  have to progress a  lot and work hard, 
or wait and be in the same conditions, and I  don't like that." 
Whether you want it or not you will progress, because that is your 
nature. There are two ways to change. By the whip of destiny (you may 
call it Karma) or by reasoning. You can learn your lesson-by observation 
and meditation. Then there is no need for you to undergo certain cir­
cumstances to learn the lesson. Or, if you do not want this, being under 
the fascination and the enchantment of events and things, making the 
same mistakes again and again, you will get the same experiences (I will 
not call it punishment). You have to learn the lesson by one of these two 
ways. Cause and effect. 
Let us go back and look at the main questions that we discussed and 
see what we found out: 1. Practise the skills of Observation, Concentra­
tion, Meditation and Visualization. 2. What is Life? Life, Everlasting 
Life, is God, and we are Life, we are God. 3. We are not our body,  we 
are not our emotions, we are not our thoughts. 4. We have to master 
our emotions and thoughts, i.e. we must de-energize negative element­
als (emotion-forms and thought-forms) and put in their place good el­
ementals. 5. Cast your personal egoism out and practise instead love, 
unconditional love, for God and all human beings. And yO'ur present­
day-personality will gradually approach the Permanent Personality. 6. Be 
aware of your personality self and be aware of your Soul-Self. Develop 
your self-consciousness to Soul-Self-consciousness, and live it. Simply 
using the Mind as thought will not lead to the truth - we have to live the 
truth and experience it. 7. Every human being has a  way which is best 
for him or her to find his or her inner real Self. Let yourself be guided by 
your Guardian Archangel and your Spirit  Guides.  Christ  said, '"I am the 
Way, the Truth, and the Life."

CHAPTER IO 
Light,  Physical  World, ·Psychical World,  Noetical World, 
God, Idea of Man, Exosomatosis 
God is not what man calls God.  Using the word God, man minimizes 
Absolute Beingness and puts It to his own measure. Man has created 
many gods. The ancient Greeks called them demigods and so did the 
Egyptians. They were simply creating elementals. 
What are elementals? Within the universes there is Mind. Mind is 
not God, it is the means through which God, the Absolute Beingness ex­
presses Itself either as Christ Logos or as Holy Spirit. Absolute Beingness 
expresses Itself in many more ways, but we human beings can understand 
only these two. How Archangels understand the expression of God, we 
cannot know. We only know two qualities of God, the Logoic and the Holy 
Spiritual. We believe in one God-the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. 
Now what is God and what is not God? God is Absolute Beingness. 
Don't even think that you are able to comprehend It, it is not possible. 
When you try to perceive the light by looking at the sun with your mater­
ial eyes,  you  will  be  blinded. This is  the same as  trying to perceive 
God using your material brain. Yet we can observe His expressions and 
through His expressions we can know what God is, up to a certain point. 
I will give you an example. The light is not visible. The vibrations 
which we call light are not visible. But its rays have the capacity to hit 
a surface, to illuminate it and to be reflected presenting an image to 
the human eyes. Yet the light itself is not visible. If you look up at the 
sky you will see many stars. Many of these stars are radiating their .own 
light, others reflect light. We definitely cannot see the light. To perceive 
the light in space it must hit a so-called heavenly body and reflect the 
light. Now you can see that star, you can see the light. Before the light, 
which is radiated from a sun,  reaches that star, it is not visible.  But 
as soon as it strikes the surface of the star it becomes visible. In the 
same way God is elusive within the Infinite, within the universes until it 
84 

reaches a  materially existing human being so as to be expressed in that 
man as  intellect and self-awareness. 
Now,  what is  self-awareness and what is  intellect? Can we, for ex­
ample, say that the light after being reflected from a  material object, 
is  the real, original light? Is  the quality of the light, are the vibrations 
which are striking the object, the same as those which come back to us, 
after having struck the material object? Of course not. 
So, light, which is invisible, strikes a surface, is then reflected from 
that surface, and returns back, invisible again, until it  reaches the hu­
man eye. Then the point of the material object that has been hit by the 
reflected light, is  visible. In this way it  reaches our intellect and so we 
know that it is light. 
Likewise, when God, Absolute Beingness in Its Plurality,  radiates 
from Its Absolute Source (the divine holy Monad), to express Itself with­
in the Universes, It is elusive and invisible, at least to  the material brain. 
When we go to  the higher noetic world, we can conceive more. Not 
through the intellect and thought but through assimilation and ecstasy. 
The Absolute Beingness radiates within the universes elusive Spirit: the 
Spirit "blows its breath" according to its :will. When the Spirit hits on 
light it  meets with the Idea of  man. What  does it  mean "it meets with"? 
It  means, that it  is  in the divine Plan, that within the universes there 
exists a  point, the Idea of Man. In this case the light represents for us 
the Idea of  Man. From this point, this ray of Spirit proceeds to  become 
man, a material human being. Still invisible and elusive. 
Tell  me, how many of us, as self-awareness, know their selves as 
Soul-Self-awareness, before they have reached that point? Does the aver­
age person know what Soul is? What God is? What is  God, our re.al 
Self? The Soul-Self-awareness descends and dresses itself with matter, 
psychical matter, noetkal matter, noetic substance and Supersubstance. 
All these dresses are matter. 
Now, what is  matter? We cannot deny knowing what matter is. How 
about scientifically? Scientifically matter does not exist. It  is  known to 
be 
condensed  energy. But I  cannot deny that this chair and this table 
and this human being do exist. I  can touch them,· I know them, they 
consists of material, liquid or  gaseous states. 
In order to perceive what matter is, we have to use something which 
vibrates at  the same frequency of vibration, otherwise we cannot per­
ceive it. This goes For our material hand, our eyes, our brain, our five 
senses. We touch this table and we know it  exists. Let us say, this table 
Words of Truth I Chapter I 0 
85 

vibrates in the range from one to ten and our material hand vibrates in 
the range from one to ten, too. So our material hand will perceive it as 
something solid, because hand and table co-vibrate in the same range 
of 
frequencies. But if our hand did not vibrate in the same range of vib­
ration, like our etheric hand, which we can use and feel by means of 
aesthetic and kinetic ether, it would pass through the table. The table 
will not be an obstacle for our etheric hand, which vibrates, say, in the 
range from ten to twenty. And the same is true for our psychical hand. 
We perceive the material world around us the way we do, because 
of the five senses. The five senses in a material body vibrate in the same 
range of vibrations as the gross material world.  But we do not have a 
material body only. We have other bodies, the so-called psychical body, 
the noetical body and the noetic body. 
Now the average person, who has as a centre of his self-aware self 
only the five senses, his material body, sex, his stomach and his material 
brain, has a limited perception of things around him and cannot per­
ceive vibrations beyond the range of one to ten, which corresponds to 
gross matter only. But if we transfer the self-awareness and conscious­
ness to the range from ten to twenty, then we will see that the vibrations 
which we will perceive, will be from another world, very different from 
the material world. We call it the psychical world. 
Now, what are the psychical worlds? Do mountains and houses ex­
ist there? Yes, everything exists there. But we are not able to perceive 
it, because we are not vibrating at the same range of vibrations as those 
worlds. When we transfer our self-awareness and consciousness to these 
frequencies of vibration, the real world for us will be the psychical world 
and not the material world. The material world will disappear for us. 
In the lower vibration range from one to ten we perceive the mater­
ial world. In the next range from ten to twenty we perceive the psychical 
world. What is the relation between the psychical world and the mater­
ial world? In the material world we can only perceive a few thousand 
square-miles of the planet's surface, nothing else. The remaining two 
thirds of the surface are water. What can we perceive with our material 
body? Very little. Lakes, mountains, cities, clouds, physical conditions. 
Some of it created by man, some not. 
The psychical world is much bigger.  It has seven planes and each 
plane has seven subplanes, together forty-nine. You may ask how big 
they are. The whole material world is like a spot in one of the subplanes 
of the psychical world. Are these worlds inhabited? Definitely, yes, with 
86 

entities, intelligences higher than human beings. The material  plane 
with its low frequencies of vibration dulls man's mind. 
Next we have the noetical worlds, which also have seven planes 
divided in  seven subplanes,  together  forty-nine. These worlds are still 
bigger, richer and brighter. 
As we said already, if the light does not strike on a point it cannot be per­
ceived. So, if we as self-awareness do not reach the noetic light, the noeti­
cal light, and the psychical light then nothing psychical can be known to us. 
Man is a  Self-awareness. This so-called self-aware existence within 
the gross material body of,  let us say, George is very limited and can only 
perceive vibrations of the three-dimensional world. 
What  is  the three-dimensional world? It  is  the world which gives 
us  the solid, the density,  the weight and the width. It  is the law of the 
three-dimensional world that no two objects of  the same density or fre­
quency can occupy the same space. This is the law of the gross material 
world. 
The laws of the planes and subplanes of the psychical and the noetic­
al worlds are very different. Thousands of objects can occupy the same 
space without upsetting each other. It is a matter of coordination and of 
vibration and nothing else. We can see something similar in the material 
world. In  this room for example exist the signals of  all the broadcasting 
stations, but can we hear them? No. If we had a radio receiver tuned to 
one of  the frequencies of  the different broadcasting stations, we  would 
hear music. So something that was not existing for us  up to that moment 
becomes a  reality through coordination. So  even in  the material world 
we  have to  understand that space is not something that upsets objects 
or  things  contained in. it,  when they are beyond the three dimensions, 
for example etheric vibrations of the radio and TV signals. 
' 
Through scientific research we can understand many-things. The 
so-called real which is given to  us through the five senses is only a small 
part of the reality. 
Someone may ask where are the worlds and environments of  the 
psychical planes and subplanes. They are all  here, the hells and the 
paradises. It  is a matter of  coordination and nothing else. So  the fourth 
dimension is  free from the influence of  space. Einstein began to  talk 
of  this, but stopped. We boldly proceed and say that space in  the four 
dimensional world does not have the same meaning that it  has in  the 
material world. The various experiments with telepathy prove that space 
does not correspond to the meaning that is normally attributed to it. 
Words of Truth I Chapter JO 
87 

Researchers of  the  truth study what is  the  light on  the  ma'terial 
plane, how it travels, how it influences us and what it is doing. 
Let us look at the  material light. We have said  that  it strikes on  a 
surface, is reflected and returns to our eyes carrying some form or im­
age.  This image leaves a stimulus in the dark part of the material brain 
and "I", a mysterious entity (we shall study and research this entity later) 
interprets those vibrations. 
And in this way  we say  that we see a  tree. Let  us  assume we  are 
standing at a  great distance from that  tree. Can we  from this position 
see the tree and the birds on it? - No. Why? - The light rays as they are 
travelling back to us come so  close to each other that the image of the 
surface, they were reflected by, deteriorates. 
If we  get,  say,  seven times closer to that tree than before, we can 
see  the  birds. Even if  we  do  not  move from where we  are,  but  use  a 
telescope, what does this mean? It  means that the telescope opens up 
the  vibrations (spreads the  rays  of  light, magnifying  the image). With 
a telescope the light presents itself to us the same way as if our physi­
cal position was seven times closer. So  we  can  see  everything. If I ask 
you now: "Can you see the birds", you will  answer: "Yes". Did you come 
nearer to see them? You will say:  "No, yet I  can see  them". If I had not 
given you the telescope, would you be able to see the birds? Would you 
even know of their existence? -Of course not. 
Studying material light we  will receive and  see  the  impressions it 
presents to us, and we will analyze the impressions. When we study the 
light very carefully, we will discover that it has powers which we can make 
our own. How can we make them our own, unless we study the light? We 
must know that we do not become masters of anything unless we study it. 
Now, the  concept of  space is  different in  the  psychical world. If 
we do not transfer our self-awareness into the so-called psychical body 
performing the so-called exosomatosis to visit the psychical world, how 
will we come to know what the psychical world is? 
In the same way that we see the material world, we can also see the 
psychical world. Just  as  there are  laws governing the  material  world, 
there are  laws for  the  psychical and noetical worlds.  Those worlds are 
not  uncontrolled, they are  under the  divine Total Wisdom and  Total 
Power, since there exist immovable laws. 
Now we  begin to  enter into the concept of  God. The  God we per­
ceive with our intellect is  different from the  God many people believe 
in: an  old  man with a white  beard judging and punishing us. 
88 

As I have already said, man has, in time and space, created many 
gods - elementals,  thought-projections of man. Such thought-project­
ions 
of many men concentrated on the same point do create a power. 
What is the purpose of the research of the truth for us? To pass the 
time? - No.  We  have to study to  know about the worlds, the different 
dimensions and all the universes. Christ said: "Be ye therefore perfect, 
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." This is a strong per­
suasion, not to say  a command. And Christ also said: "God is Spirit: and 
they that  worship him must worship him  in spirit and in truth." God is 
Spirit and those who know Him must approach Him in Spirit and Truth. 
To worship means - to move towards. 
We will not see God on a piece of wood. Of course we can impregnate an 
icon or an idol with magnetism, we have studied this, but all this serves man. 
In reality God is Spirit and only in Spirit and Truth can we approach him. 
Now, what is God not? God is not what men believe He is, an idol, an 
icon or an elemental that performs phenomena. Of course phenomena can 
happen. But what are they? They are the result of dedication and concen­
tration of m;ny persons on a form, on a thought and this idea gets exist­
ence. But this happens automatically and these persons do not know how 
it happens, how they achieved it and how it may serve them. The element­
als can be evil, destructive, or good and beneficial, but they are NOT Goo. 
Can we say that man has created gods? Don't tell me that it is Cod 
who created them because this would minimize the concept of the Ab­
solute Beingness. God did not create us, we are not a creation. We are 
Him. We are his extension and  He created George and  Mary,  the  per­
sonality, the material, 
i;>
sychical and noetical bodies. 
Now George or  Mary move within the  material body. After some 
hours the material body feels tired and it falls asleep, most of the ti
m
e 
without dreams. Dreams do not exist. While dreaming they· have simply 
entered the psychical worlds without noticing it. And  because they are 
not  able to sort  things out,  they  are  getting upset with it  all,  thinking 
that these worlds are not real. 
Now George and  Mary. They are  entities receiving impressions. 
most of  the  time subconsciously. But  even  the  conscious impressions, 
how many do they not perceive through their five senses? So when we 
practise our exercises, we will see, that we will be able to perceive  more 
and more impressions and experiences. 
We can see now that we are living mechanically in a material world. 
We are getting one tenth of the impressions of  this world and yet we say 
Words of Trut
h 
I C
h
e1pter JO 
89 

that we live. Christ called us "dead". "Let the dead bury their own dead." 
Life means intense perceptio�, knowledge of the reality. 
Of course we  cannot demand from the researchers of the truth to 
expand their consciousness or  to  make exosomatosis and to  live  con­
sciously in the psychical world, since they do not even live consciously 
in the material world. They live exactly in the same poor way as all other 
people in the material world. 
For example, if you come for a walk with me now you will pass many 
people, shops, trees, etc. and you will see many forms, images; images 
which through the  light  will  reach your  optic field  giving a  stimulus 
to your material brain. At the end  of our walk  I will ask you  what you 
have seen. Do you think that you will" be able to describe even one hun­
dredth of the impressions that you received. You will mention some of 
the things, which attracted your attention. But you saw much more, you 
received thousands of vibrations, which are  all imprinted in  your sub­
consciousness. Everything you see, even subconsciously, is imprinted in 
your subconsciousness. 
What  are  the  means to imprint something? Let  us  take  one  step 
further. The material light includes both, the psychical and the noetical 
light. Imprinting on the consciousness is not accomplished by the mater­
ial light, but by the psychical and the noetical light, which leave images 
in the consciousness. 
Do you know that your personality is nothing else than the total of your 
experiences and your impressions. But you are not only all of that, you are 
also something else. You are the one who interprets or misinterprets, the 
one who knows but is intoxicated and enchanted by all this at present. 
But one day,  when you acknowledge your experiences and impres­
sions you will master and manage them yourself. Reaching Self-realiza­
tion is the purpose of the researchers of the truth, which means they try 
to find their real inner Self. 
Just as God is shapeless, amorphous, and has never been born and 
will  never die,  so  are  you.  You  are  looking now  at  substance, at gross 
matter, at  that  threefold mirror called matter,  psychical matter (emo­
tion), noetical matter (thought) and  matter-form. They are  three sur­
faces of the same mirror. Just imagine how  distorted they render your 
form. 
We said shapeless.  Shapeless within the concept of  form. The  Idea 
of Man is not formless. Without a body, yes,  but formless, no.  Because 
the concept of form exists. It is the law and cause of shapes. 
90 

Now let us proceed with God. What is God now? Law, Cause, Total 
Wisdom which is  expressed as intellect in  man  through the  qualities 
of  Mind.  When we say  Mind we do not mean the material brain. The 
material brain  is  machinery. Mind is the  Supersubstance, substance, 
super-matter and  matter  through which self-aware or  not  self-aware 
consciousness creates the universes. 
Look at the material universe, there is order everywhere. If we plant 
a eucalyptus seed, it will not grow up as an orange tree. Or if we take 
seeds from one country and plant them in another, they will not change 
their kind. A small seed that we perhaps cannot see with the naked eye 
contains in it all the laws, the Total Wisdom and Total Power. 
Let us look at the spermatozoon. That spermatozoon, when it finds 
the proper conditions according to its circle of possibilities and prob­
abilities, will create a remarkable material body.  It gath•ers a psychical 
and noetical body and gives us the personality self-awareness of man. 
I am not saying that it is we who create. He who takes the sperma­
tozoon in or�er to express a time and place entity, is eternal. He is above 
the concept of time and space. He is a God. Christ said, "I say to you, 
that you are Gods and Sons of the Almighty." 
We  shall  discover this  when  we  practise exosomatosis. Now  we 
receive it as thought, as a logical explanation. But to understand who we 
are in reality, we must during exosomatosis go out of our material body, 
to  find  ourselves in  the  psychical body,  gaining the  powers of  our 
psychical body which are unlimited in comparison to those of our material 
body. 
When we are leaving our psychical body, then we will find ourselves 
in our noetical body. When we go out of our noetical body, then we will 
find ourselves in the noetic world, which scientists call Super-light. We 
call it the inextinguis.hable light. Entering there we will see· who we are 
in the mirror that we call noetic Supersubstance. There we will not see 
George or  Mary.  Pay attention to this  point.  You  will not see  George 
or  Mary as matter, but as the form, the vibration, the tone, which has 
been  characterizing George or  Mary  during the  centuries. He,  who 
knows them in the Super-noetic world, will recognize them. As George 
or  Mary?  If one knew them as  George or  Mary,  then he can identify 
them.  If he did not know them but is developed enough, then he can 
still get, in an instant, the whole life of George or Mary from their Self­
awareness. Only this incarnation? No, he can see, at the same time, all 
the previous incarnations they had. 
Words of Truth I Chnpter 10

So, we as "I am I", as the one who knows, who interprets and misinter­
prets, and who classifies, we �re shapeless, immortal, and eternal. 
I will repeat, what Christ said. "I say to you, Ye are  Gods and  Sons 
of the Almighty'', but as man you pass over. This means, you change the 
conditions. As St.  Paul said, "Every day I die, but I am still living." 
Wh�re  are  the  eight-year-old George and  Mary now? George has 
become a man and Mary a woman. Not even a single molecule or atom 
stayed the same in their bodies, but George and  Mary still exist. They 
will have a different form, a different way of perception and expression. 
As there does not exist even an atom of the eight-year-old boy or girl in 
the body of  George or  Mary,  after thirty years, there will not exist any 
atom in their bodies which is existing now at this moment. 
As Self-awareness, as  a centre of  consciousness, receiving impres­
sions, George or Mary remain the same. No matter whether they spread 
within the universes, or perceive within all the  universes or  enter into 
an atom and receive impressions there, they are complete. They neither 
become smaller or bigger as a Self-awareness. 
We talked a lot now. We have to sit down, think consciously about 
this and come to conclusions. Through meditation we have to enter into 
the meaning of God, our real Self, into what we are and what we are not, 
into what is God and what is not God. 
What will be the result? By making use of the Mind as right think­
ing, by means of concentration and contemplation, we may claim more 
powers. One day,  we  will reach a point, where we no longer depend on 
knowledge which we  receive from our  environment, from an  outside 
world. We will gain new powers. These are the power of concentration, 
coordination, attunement and at-one-ment. Only with a simple concen­
tration on something, let us say a flower, we will become the flower and 
while we  close and open our eyes we can know everything concerning 
the flower. In  this way  we  will learn many things about anything in  an 
instant which otherwise would require years of  study. We will not talk 
about the power of ecstasy,  this is even higher. 
An  easy  explanation of  God, which we  must study,  is  love. We 
have plenty within us and we  express it. Even though we express it in 
a strange way, it is love. God is Love. When we interpret what is love in 
all its levels, this is another path which will lead us into the Truth. The 
Truth and the Light are not only reached by one path. All the paths are 
one road.

CHAPTER II 
God the Father, Spirit-Ego, Soul-Ego, Introspection, 
Willpower, Light-Life, Consciousness 
We  shall make a brief revision of what we believe. What we believe is 
not just imagination. It is knowledge and experience. We know what the 
enlightened ones of past centuries have taught the huma11ity. And  we 
know what our most beloved Lord, Joshua Immanuel, the God-man con­
firmed. How did he confirm it? By speaking and preaching, but mainly by 
his example and by his works: his wonders and miracles. And by proving 
to us that our material body and our other bodies (the so-called psych­
ical and noetical) are not our real Self, but that we are Gods, offspring 
of Alaha - as Joshua used to call God. That is the reality. What Joshua 
taught two thousand years ago, we will hear today in this lesson. 
The Absolute Infinite Reality is the Absolute Infinite Beingness, and 
Be-ness, we call God. What we know as the characteristics of this Abso­
lute Beingness is that apart from Its Self-sufficiency there is also in Him 
the Will-pleasure to manifest Itself in Itself. 
How do we know that?  By examining, by learning and studying the 
phenomena of life, in which we can see the Total Wisdom of the Infinite 
Beingness and Its Almightiness and  Its great Love for Its creation arid 
for us human beings. 
What  the Absolute Be-ness, God  the  Father, is, no  human being 
can know. Joshua Immanuel the Christ, the God-man, was  preaching 
to his disciple-healers (He did not only have twelve disciples. He had 
thousands of Israelites and Essenes), teaching them healing, preaching 
them the Reality. Joshua Immanuel the God-man called God "his father 
and our father." 
Now, Jesus and his family and most of his disciples were  Essenes. 
They were not Jews. What were the Essenes? The Essenes appeared in 
Egypt as descendants of the Israelites and Greeks in Egypt who worsh­
ipped and believed in "Aton," the One Spirit-God. "Ankh-en-Aton" had 
Words of Truth I Chapter 11 
93 

declared this God to be the real God, breaking the idols. For centuries 
there 
was a fight between the old religion of the gods, the idols, and the 
new religion of the One God; the Spirit-God, the God of the heavens 
and of earth. 
The Essenes spoke Greek, being Greek-speaking Israelites, who had 
remained in Egypt. The Egyptians were also speaking Greek and Aramaic. 
The Aramaic language derived from the Egyptian language. The Essenes 
were in Egypt, in Palestine, in Cyprus, in Asia Minor, and in Mesopota­
mia.  They worshipped the One God, the Father,  the benevolent Father. 
At that time there were three religions: The idolaters, worshipping 
idols, false gods. They were th� Greeks and the Romans. Then we have 
the Essenes believing in a  God calling Him in Greek "o Theos" and in 
Aramaic "Alaha." They believed in a  God, the Father, the Merciful - a 
loving Spirit-God. And the Israelites were also believing in One-Spirit­
God, but a God of vengence. So the difference between the Essenes and 
the Israelites was that the Essenes were believing in a benevolent father 
Alaha, while the Israelites were believing in a  powerful, vengeful God 
who was claiming blood sacrifices. 
Both of them believed in one and the same Alaha, and the Essenes 
considered the Israelites as their brothers, while the Israelites consid­
ered the Essenes as heretics. Why? Because the Essenes made reforms 
- no blood sacrifices. They no longer believed in the God of Moses who 
in the old days was even claiming human sacrifices. You find sacrifices 
mentioned in the Old Testament. Ibrahim or Abraham was to sacrifice 
his son Ishak or Isaac. So there was a great difference between the Alaha 
of the Essenes and the Alaha of the Israelites. 
Now, though the Essenes were loving the Israelites, the Israelites 
considered the Essenes as heretics and killed them by stoning whenever 
they had an opportunity. And that is what they did to Joshua Immanuel 
the Christ -they crucified him. After his crucifixion some people 
claimed that Joshua Immanuel the Christ was just a  man who had lost 
his powers and that the crucifixion showed the weakness of a  human 
being. And even Kaiaphas was provoking Christ at the crucifixion: "He 
helped all the others, and he is not able to help himself, now." But for 
the Essenes it was not the weakness of a  human being, of the Son of 
Man, but rather the triumph of the God-man. 
If you read the New Testament you will find that Joshua spoke on 
many occasions about his crucifixion. In one instance Peter told him, 
"Why don't you go to Syria where you will no longer be under the 
94 

authority of the Jews, of the Sanhedrin." And Joshua replied, "It is for 
this hour that I have come, ... to prove that what I  am teaching is true. 
The material body is not me; your material body is not you. And don't be 
afraid of those who can kill your material  body; they can do nothing to 
your Soul-Ego-Self. Here is this body; they will crucify it." 
They wounded his body very badly as he had foreseen and foretold. 
"In three days I will heal it and raise it up." Which he did. So he practi­
cally 
proved the truth of his teaching. And he remained with his disci­
ples 
and those believing in him for another fifty days, showing them the 
wounds 
caused by the nails, and he was eating with them. "Here is my 
material body which they have crucified, but my body is not myself." 
Do Christians now know the truth about that very great lesson given 
to all the human beings? Did he not devalue the material body? He 
gave it its right value. He called the material body the "t!!mple of God." 
A great honour, for God, the Father,  is in your body, also, in your per­
sonality as your Ego-Self, as your Soul. So we can say that Joshua had 
preached the whole truth. 
In a lesson that Joshua had given his disciple-healers, both Israelites 
and Essenes, he said, "My most beloved ones, offspring of Alaha, our 
heavenly father." He was preaching at the same time in Greek for the 
Essenes and in Aramaic to the Israelites. 
Then he said, "God the Father sent you as Spirit-Soul-Egos, part of 
your real Self, as a  ray of life, to live as a  human being." A Metathrone 
egofied and became your Guardian Archangel. Everyone of you, all of 
us, have a Guardian Archangel. This we should keep in mind. 
And then, Alaha,  expressing and manifesting his Will-pleasure to 
create a human being, said to the holy Archangels of the elements, to the 
seven Orders of the Archangels, "Let us create man." He said "create." 
So the human being is a creature, but with a difference now1 "  ... in our 
image and according to our likeness," being a  God himself. 
These holy Archangels co-vibrated to the Will-pleasure of God and 
created the human being. I repeat " ... in the image and according to the 
likeness of Alaha." Not less. And the God-man gave us instruction and 
persuasion: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your. Father which is in 
heaven is perfect." Very enlightening words. 
Now, he told the holy Archangels to materialize the human form us­
ing 
the Mind Supersubstance vitality as matter, as ether, as substance, 
as Supersubstance,  and in another three divine states: creating the ma­
terial body of man, his etheric double; the psychical or emotion body 
Words of Truth I Chapter 11 
95 

with its etheric double; and the noetical body with its  etheric double. 
These bodies are mortal, they are changing all the time in the worlds of 
existence. But there are two· additional bodies which are  imperishable; 
they  are our Spirit-Ego-Body and its etheric double, our Soul-Self. 
A human being is a Spirit-Ego-Self. But he or she is also a Soul-Ego­
Self.  Both are  God, immortal, never changing. You will ask what is the 
difference between the Spirit-Ego-Self and the Soul-Ego-Self? 
I  will  give  you  an  example; it  is very poor, but  we  have no  better 
example. Take a  window,  without anything on  it.  The  sun  is  shining 
through the  window leaving the shape of  the window on the floor. So, 
the light of  the sun,  coming ·to the  window is exactly the same as the 
light passing through the  window. There is  nothing on  the  window to 
change it. But the  light from the window to the floor is getting the form 
of the window.  So,  the light from the sun  to  the  window is  our  Spirit­
Ego-Self, God. The light from the window to the floor is our Spirit, now 
Soul-Ego-Self. And the light on the  floor? Our personality-self. 
The personality-self is changing, in accordance with the law govern­
ing  the  worlds of  existence: the  noetical world, our  noetical body,  the 
psychical worlds, our  so-called psychical body, the  material body,  and 
their etheric doubles - they  are all dual. This is the law of the worlds of 
existence: changing continuously and thereby  giving rise to the sense of 
death.  Because our material body is not going to live f
o
r a  long time. But 
our material body is dying every day and regenerating. Our human body, 
the material body, had been the spermatozoon in the womb of our moth­
er, a baby, a girl or a boy. Growing and growing, to an adult, a young man 
or woman, to  a middle-aged man or woman, to  an  old man  or woman. 
They simply have to follow the way of our human possibilities. We have 
to f
o
llow through, that is our possibility. We have to go through it. 
Saint Paul said, " ...  every day I die and every day the holy Archang­
els of the elements are regenerating me." 
What does orthodox science say today: In  a  material body nothing 
remains the  same after seven years. Everything is  changing until the 
material body is  dissolved. But  our  material body is  not  our  self.  It  is 
not even our personality ego-self. I have said in many lessons: As matter 
and  substance the  material bodies of  all  human beings are  the  same. 
Studying the body of a woman and the body of a man, l know how the 
body of every woman and every man is. And if the personality of a man, 
the ego-personality of a man, were the product of the material body, all 
women and all men would be the same. But this is not so. 
96 

I  said studying the body of a  woman and of a  man will enable you 
to know the body of every woman and every man. But each man and 
each 
woman has a  different personality - each one is expressing in the 
phenomenon of life a  different self. 
Is that time-and-place self, our personality,  our real Self? Yes and 
no. What is changing all the time in our personal self - our unceasingly 
changing emotions, desires, weaknesses, and thoughts -is not our real 
Self. It is composing our personality's egoism.   Because the personality 
with its egoism is the total of the elementals we are creating. And these 
elementals are not our Self. But to allow this personal self to live, it is in 
need of our real Self, which is in it. 
How can we distinguish between our Self and that which is not our 
Self - and know who and what we are? In our System for the research of 
the truth we give certain exercises: INTROSPECTION, lookitig within,  and 
USING MIND VITALI'IY in the proper way; exercising our divine nature 
which is OBSERVATION and WILLPOWER. 
Is there not willpower in the personality of a  man? No. What a  per­
sonality of a  man is showing is obstinacy and stupidity - not divine will­
power.  No-one using the obstinacy of his personality can do anything. 
But the God-man using his divine willpower could materialize the Mind 
vitality into bread and fish -and feed five thousand, not counting the 
women and children. On another occasion he fed four thousand, not 
counting the women and children. These two cases are mentioned in 
the New Testament of the Bible. I  can tell you that Joshua had done it 
many,  many times. This is the willpower, the divine willpower which has 
nothing to do with the human obstinacy. 
Now, you may ask, ''We have this human obstinacy, don't we also 
have the willpower?" In your personality - no. But when you unfold th� 
Ego-Self,  your Soul-Ego-Self,  you can express and manifest' this will­
power, which is one orthe characteristics of your Spirit-Soul-Ego-Self. 
Can we do what Joshua Immanuel the Christ has done? What did 
he say? "Yes, he who believes in me, in what I  am teaching you, can do 
what l am doing and even greater works than I am doing." Because all of 
us are offspring of God; his Father,  our Father. 
Let us come back to what Joshua Immanuel the Christ said to his 
disciple-healers. Some of you hearing the word "Alaha" do not like it. 
This is wrong. Why? Because the word "Alaha" coming from the old 
Egyptian language and the Aramaic language is a whole sentence. "Al" 
means God; "la" means the Will-pleasure of God; and "ha" means the 
Words of Truth I  Chapter 11 
97 

divine plan and God's Will-pleasure. In which language can you find just 
in a word all those meanings? 
The  Essenes were  calling God  "Theos" or  "Alaha". Elohim means 
God in His plurality. Why one word, Elohim? Because in His plurality 
God is still in His One-ness. So everything has its own meaning. 
Joshua said that  God or Alaha is Life,  inextinguishable Light. But 
what is Light? It is not what we see with the two balls full of water - our 
eyes.  It is much more.  Joshua  spoke about Life Light, and he said that 
all seven heavens, all the worlds of existence had been created by the 
holy Archangels of the elements - all the worlds of existence and all that 
is in them. 
This  inextinguishable divine Light Life  is  luminosity of  various 
degrees of brightness. Each variety of this luminosity brightness is giving 
us a part of creation: e.g. stones, rocks, water, the seas, the oceans. Oth­
er varieties of luminous brightness give us the vegetable kingdom with 
all its beauty, trees and flowers. Other varieties of luminosity brightness 
- life, give us the animal kingdom, very rich in phenomena of life. And 
other varieties of this Light-luminosity-brightness give us other things in 
nature: the ethereal and the psychical world. And another gives us the 
noetical world and whatever is in it. So this variety of luminosity-Life­
Light gives us the seven heavens. 
Now, we have spoken about matter. We have spoken about the veget­
able kingdom. Different brightness of luminosity. We spoke about the 
animal kingdom; again another degree of luminosity Life. We mentioned 
things in the ethereal and in the psychical and noetical worlds. 
What about the human beings? What kind of Life Light is in a hu­
man being? He said, "I say to you, you are Gods, all of you, Sons of the 
Almighty. And the kingdom of the heavens is in you, in your Spirit-Soul­
Ego-Self." 
That is why we are Gods. This is the great, great theory. 
Joshua Immanuel the God-man put his teaching in practical terms. 
He said, "You are now my disciple-healers, and you should know that all 
degrees of brightness and luminosity are in you, manifested in - what 
we call - consciousness." He spoke about sensitivity and sensibility. The 
material things are sensitive to hot, to cold and to the light. We have in 
our bodies also sensitivity and sensibility: in our bones, in our muscles. 
He  spoke about subconsciousness and  the  in-between, between 
sensibility and sensitivity and  subconsciousness - he spoke about ins­
tinct. We have sensibility and sensitivity in matter and in the vegetable 
98 

kingdom. And he spoke about subconsciousness. Now the animal king­
dom  has  instinct and  something which we  cannot even call  subcon­
sciousness. 
The  human being has  - what we  call - subconsciousness. And I 
am  telling you  that eighty percent of  the  human beings living on  the 
planet now are living subconsciously. And we have - what we call- wak­
ing consciousness. How many are expressing waking consciousness and 
know what they are doing? How many? Very few. 
Joshua Immanuel gave us  the way to unfold in us this waking con­
sciousness. And  we have  also  self-consciousness, concerning our  per­
sonality self.  We  have  the  fourth luminosity in  brightness. We have to 
unfold in us  our real  Self.  Which means now: the real  Self-conscious­
ness. And he says that you should develop, unfold in yourself, your Self­
Superconsciousness. How? 
Alaha, God  the  Father,  has  given you  your  body-to use  the five 
senses. These  five  senses give  you  the  awareness; creating in  you  the 
presentations of  what the  holy Archangels have created around you  in 
the materiaT world. You experience the material world instinctively and 
subconsciously. 
Do we have, apart from the five senses, other senses - seeing, not 
with these two little balls full of water, our eyes? 
To put it in plain words: - Expand your self-consciousness in space! 
He was doing it. And he even taught Philippos; and some of the listeners 
knew this  Spirit power. Today we call it "out of body experiences" and 
exosomatosis in  Greek. When Joshua was  in  Jerusalem and  Philippos 
and  Nathanael were in  Bethsaida - where Philippos' and  Nathanael's 
home was - Philippos ·said to Nathanael, "We have found the  Messiah." 
When they  came to  Jerusalem, Joshua said  to  Philippos,  "When you 
were under the fig tree with Nathanael, I have seen you and ·I have heard 
you." Bethsaida is many kilometres away from Jerusalem. This  means 
that  Joshua practised expansion, extension of  his  Self-consciousness 
in place-space. He had taught Philippos and  other disciples also.  Only 
that? 
Reading the Acts of the Apostles, you read that  Philippos while be­
ing 
in Jerusalem had left his  material body there and had  materialized 
a body many kilometres away from Jerusalem at the  borders of  Egypt. 
He sat in the chariot of the treasurer of the Queen of Ethiopia who was 
reading  from the  prophet Isaiah. Philippos materialized himself by the 
side of the Ethiopian treasurer and self-consciously asked him, "Do you 
Words of Truth I Chapter 1 I 
99 

understand what you are reading?" Just think of that Ethiopian, all of 
a  sudden seeing on his chariot a  human being. He answered Philippos 
and said, "How can I  underst-and, master, without someone explaining 
to me?" And Philippos spoke to him about Joshua Immanuel the Christ. 
Then he told him,  "To save yourself you should be baptised in the name 
of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. This is what the Master 
had instructed us." They came down from the chariot to a  place where 
there was water. Philippos baptised the Ethiopian and dematerialized 
his body. 
This means that we have to unfold in our personal ego-self what I 
call Super Consciousness -enter in the fifth heaven. And then? What 
is more? This also means being able to expand yourself, to be Self-con­
scious, to concentrate in order to see and know.  Not by learning, now, 
but by at-one-ment with  what  you are. 
Can you imagine what kind of Self-consciousness that is? Let us 
call it Self-consciousness, Self-Super consciousness, which means that 
in this heaven you have to be able to know by attunement. What is 
attunement? Properly co-vibrating, yet being two -being in the world 
of existence. 
What are the next two heavens of our so-called Spirit-Soul-Ego­
Self? What did Joshua Immanuel say? You must unfold your real Self; 
enter in the world of the divine One-ness, by what we call At-one-ness 
or Attunement. But this state is not mundane or worldly,  it is divine. 
Which means -you have returned back home. Yes. 
Have any human beings since the time of Joshua Immanuel the 
Christ reached that state? Yes, many. But there is a burning "but." There 
are certain Spirit-Soul-Egos who can be in at-one-ment with God and 
with the God-man. But what is the Will-pleasure of the God-man, the 
beloved one, the most beloved one? This paradise is not for you. What 
did he say? "He who wants to follow me shall shoulder his cross and fol­
low me." Therefore, those who reach this point, of surrendering them­
selves to Him -they have to come down to the material plane; even 
in the darkest hell to serve their brethren the human beings.  Is that a 
sacrifice? No, because even in the darkest hell there is the Light. They 
(those who serve their human brethren) are not far away from HIM, 
because they are Self-consciously in what we call the omnipresence of 
the Father.  Everything is in God the Father. 
Can you do that? Can you afford within yourself this kind of Self­
consciousness? Yes, why not? All of you are offspring of God. 
100 

Human beings now are living subconsciously. Whether we want it or 
not -according to the parable of the Prodigal Son -sooner or later we 
have to be back home in our divine nature, as Spirit-Soul-Ego-Selves. 
But we have to work for it. How? 
God has given us a perfect human body, built up and sustained by 
the holy Archangels of the elements. We know very little about that 
material body, unless we open a book of anatomy. That body is under the 
supervision of the holy Archangels of the elements. 
Our ray of the Spirit-Soul-Ego-Self had created our time-and-place 
mortal self. We have been given the psychical substance and Super sub­
stance, Mind vitality. What have we done with that? Unbridled desires; 
unbridled, uncontrolled emotions; making dirty what we call love with 
stupid expressions that we call life, full of fighting and jealousies. We 
have greatly abused the Mind substance by creating bad elementals -
human demons, composing our personality. Yet, the heart and the pulse 
of life of our personality is our Soul-Being-Self. 
We hav� been given the Mind vitality as thought -to work with, to 
reach understanding and knowing and wisdom. But what have we done? 
We made thought the slave of unbridled emotion. 
So, what is our duty? First of all, we have to unfold our Self-con­
sciousness in the material body, then we have to try to make a proper 
psychical body, and unfold in it our Self-consciousness, and we have to 
form our noetical body: Control our thoughts, become masters of our 
thoughts. Then we can unfold more of our Soul-Self-consciousness and 
manifest our divine power -  we call attunement, and unfolding our Self­
Super consciousness �n at-one-ment with the divine. And what do   we 
find? That we are all Gods -Sons of the Almighty. 
, 
Some have asked, "Am I going to sacrifice my personality? Though it 
is painful, I like it." '(ou are going to lose nothing. Because every incarn­
ation with its virtues and vices, the good actions and the wickedness 
-that total collection of elementals -is living, a living whole. Looking 
behind you -in all your past lives -nothing is lost. There is a living total 
of all your experiences; an elemental in the Cosmic memory. But is that 
living? Of course, because it is Mind of the Mind vitality. 
So, when you reach that state "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your 
Father which is in heaven is perfect." 
In every incarnation you have written a book -it is in the Cosmic 
memory library on shelves. Now if you are a writer and you have written 
books -who is forbidding you to go into the library, get a volume and go 
Words of Truth I Chapter 11 
IOI 

through it again. And reading it,  you can  enjoy what is  enjoyable, and 
what is painful now - by the grace of God - will not affect you anymore. 
Because you  got  rid  of  those vices. So  you  are  not  going to  lose  any­
thing when you reach perfection. You are not going to lose your present­
day personality that is  so  precious to you!  But you  will  find inside you 
all these volumes you  have written in  all  your  past  incarnations. That 
means that  you  are  gaining, not  losing in  perfection. Nothing is  lost; 
nothing made of Mind vitality: No thoughts, no emotions, no desires are 
lost. When you reach - what we call - " attunement to",  you can attune 
yourself to any one of your incarnations. 
Can we  by at-one-ment enter in that  living total elemental of  our 
past personality? If you so wish, you can, but why should you?  Is it not 
enough - attunement, seeing and knowing? Anyhow,  it is nothing that I 
wish to do myself. 
Attunement is with Joshua Immanuel the Christ and with God, and 
not with past elementals. 
Yes,  you can  use "at-one-ment with" for God, and "attunement to" 
for everything you like.  But you can never do that unless you reach the 
highest level of Self-Superconsciousness. 
How can  we do that? Become master of VISUALIZATION: in INTRO­
SPECTION and  the  right MEDITATION manifesting your  divine state of 
OBSERVATION. 
The Mind vitality is given you as your daily bread. Use it properly, 
feed yourself and use it to make your psychical and your noetical bodies. 
Just as you are doing it with your material body - eating, drinking. And 
Joshua Immanuel said that it was not only with bread that a man should 
be fed, but with the Mind vitality. 
Your  heavenly Father is  everywhere, also  inside your  Spirit-Soul­
Ego-Self. The researchers of the truth must stop living like the animals 
around them. They should live as human beings, as Archangels, and as 
Gods. 
EXERCISE. This  is  an  exercise that  Joshua Immanuel the  Christ, 
our beloved one,  had given in  Greek and in Aramaic. We shall use the 
English language. 
Relax completely. 
The body is yours, not you. The holy Archangels and the Holy Spirit 
are sustaining it now. And they give you  the right to  use it as your own. 
It is your own: It is the temple of God - of God and of your Being-Self. 
Make this temple of God to have congregations of angelic elementals. 
102 

Take away from this temple all human demons as evil elementals:

Keep as congregation in this  temple, in  your body, human angels, 
good elementals. Create only good elementals in the light of love. 
In every temple there is a Holy of Holies. Make your heart the Holy 
of Holies of God. 
In the  Holy of Holies there is also the altar. Make it in your heart. 
On the altar is burning the inextinguishable Life Light. The holy Arch­
angels, they lit it in your heart. You are living - it is the pulse of life. 
Now we will light another wick in that lamp - your personality's love 
for God and for all human beings around you. 
Live with these two flames of light in your lamp on the altar of your 
heart - love  God and  love  all human  beings. Don't allow that  flame to 
flicker - keep it a perfect light.

CHAPTER 12 
Life, Soul-Ego, Present-day-Personality 
What is  Life  and  what is  the  life?  Life  and  the  life  are  two  different 
things. Life is Absolute Beingness, Absolute Life, the Absolute Reality. 
The life is the same Absolute Beingness in its Plurality, yet in expression 
it is the phenomenon of life. 
One  is  Life, Absolute Life.  Within this Absolute Life there are all 
the phenomena of life.  Within Absolute Life we are,  we move and we 
exist. Life is  the ocean from which we draw the life phenomenon (not 
Absolute Life) in the worlds of separateness. 
Now what is the relation between the two. Life is one, one is the Ab­
solute Beingness, Absolute Life, Absolute Reality, Self-sufficient Life, 
Truth itself. Now the life is the expression of the Absolute Beingness in 
its plurality as phenomena of life and we can see this life in many stages 
and  forms. Different is  the  life  of  the  human beings, different is the 
life in the animal kingdom, different the life in the vegetable or mineral 
kingdom. Different the angelic life, expression through the Mind, differ­
ent the archangelic life of the different archangelic orders. Can we say, 
different is the life of the Christ Logos? - No. As consciousness we are 
cells of  the Absolute Holy-Spiritua
l  Consciousness. As  self-awareness 
we are cells of the Logoic Absolute Self-Awareness. 
The Beloved One is the Light which gives Light to every human be­
ing coming into the world. This Light gives the self-awareness. So,  we 
have a cell-life  within Absolute  Life. 
I repeat: As conscious cells, we are cells of the Absolute Holy-Spirit­
ual  Consciousness. As self-aware cells, self-aware present-day-person­
alities in the  expression, we are cells of the so-called Christ or  Logoic 
Self-Awareness. But  we,  we are  not  cells - we are the life  and we are 
Life. We are the life holy-spiritually and logoically. We are Life as  Holy 
Monads, part of the Absolute Beingness. Pay  attention to this point. 
104 

Now, which is our real Self? Which form of  life does our real Self 
have? I  don't talk about the life as  expression of  the Soul because this 
has a 
beginning and an end. Absolute Life, the holy Monad's Life some­
times extends into the conditions of time and movement when it passes 
through the Heavenly Man, through the Idea of  Man, and this life has 
a  beginning and an end. There we come to the origin of "ontopeisis." 
[This word cannot be  translated. In  Greek "on" means "being" and "pei­
sis"  derives from the word "to  become." Ontopeisis is  closely linked with 
Theosis. Theosis is  seen from the point of  view of the  human being, his 
illumination and union with the Spirit-Ego, while ontopeisis is seen from 
the  point of  view of the  Spirit-Ego - what it  has  gained by its projection 
through the  Idea of  Man and its  life  on  earth until Theosis. When we 
"come home" through Theosis, we have a  "fuller"  being than our  brethren, 
the Archangels, who only know the good] 
As present-day-personality self-aware self we are logoic life. Logoic, 
but the logoic life in  the worlds of  separateness obtains its own experi­
ence and the meaning of evil stays even in the Logoic Self-Awareness. If 
it would not stay there then no control would be possible. 
The Logoic Self-awareness of  our permanent personality self, as  a 
phenomenon of  life, we are and we are not. We have a  material body, 
which is  born, grows up, develops holy-spiritually in the Total Wis­
dom, Total Power and Goodness, and, of  course, dissolves - ashes to 
ashes. As material body and its etheric double, as  psychical body and 
its etheric double, and as noetical body with its etheric double, we are 
the personality self-awareness and, as  we said, the life in  the worlds of 
separateness, in  the three-dimensional world. As a  material, psychical 
and lower noetical body we are purely holy spiritual. Pay attention to 
this point now. On this point we agree fully with the Greek orthddox 
dogma. 
Even though we say that the Life Giver is  the Holy Spirit, we say 
about the Christ Logos, that through him all was, is  and always will be. 
So our personality self-aware self, the material body, the psychical 
body,  and the noetical body as  bodies are holy-spiritual and are subject 
to the holy-spiritual consciousness and later to. the Superconscious­
ness. But as means of expression of  our inner Self, of  our permanent 
personality self-aware Self and of  our Soul self-aware Self, our bodies 
have the logoic expression. This  is  exactly what gives man this form 
of self-awareness as  a  present-day-personality.  It  is  self-awareness, but 
self-awareness within the boundaries of time and space while our Self 
Words of Tmth I Chapter 12 
105 

as Life is not within the concept of time and space but within the Abso­
lute, within the eternal now. Pay attention to this difference. 
On this kind of lessons deep meditation is needed in order to em­
pirically know these conditions. When you become aware within your­
self of what you are, and you realize that you are not in reality what you 
thought you were, you will find your self in the lowest stage of expres­
sion as present PERMANENT personality. I said present because you will 
certainly not find your self as a speculative being (as a hypothesis). You 
will find your self now, at this moment, as a being dressed with the 
present-day-personality self-awareness. 
So we have, also at present, within the present-day-personality self­
awareness, an anonymous personality self-awareness. It is exactly the 
point where the two states adjoin, come together -two states which we 
perceive as one. 
As we said in other lessons, this is symbolized by one line  with two 
ends. But we don't perceive this fact as long as we have not touched the 
two ends. We cannot distinguish where the present-day-personality self 
is or is not and where the permanent personality self-aware self is, or 
where it is not. 
So in order to make our study, to make our search we have to extend 
ourselves up to the ends of this line. 
When we will reach the ends then we will not be interested in only 
a single point of the line, the permanent personality self-aware self. We 
are concerned about two points, the bright point and the less bright 
point. The bright point, our extended real Self, will show the reality to 
our less bright self. Our Soul self-awareness, i.e. our permanent per­
sonality self-awareness knows the reality. The present-day-personality 
self-awareness, the less bright point of the line, doesn't know the reality 
and must learn it from the real inner Self. 
We can differentiate our dress from our body. We can take off our 
clothes and say: This is my body and this is my dress. We cannot say 
something similar about the permanent personality. It cannot cast off 
its expression (not to say its dress), the present-day-personality self­
awarcness, in order to know its full self. But when we will reach both 
ends, we will know. There is no other way. 
This is the    way.    This    line is the Way, the Truth and    the Life. 
The life: On this subject we have to meditate deeply so as to be able 
to identify our real Self. Then our real Self will be the will, it will know 
and it will govern the present-day-personality self. 
106 

Now, can we concentrate on the one end of the line in order to pro­
ceed? No, we  have to  concentrate on  both ends of the line simultane­
ously. Because if we concentrate on one end only, how can we compare? 
Concentration must be directed to both ends of the line simultaneously, 
but on the two ends, not on any other point of the line. 
And something else. The whole line including even the less bright 
point is the permanent  personality  self-awareness. The present-day-per­
sonality self-aware self is the time and place expression of the perman­
ent personality.  If it was not so,  how could the phenomenically perish­
able be  dressed in  indestructibility and the phenomenically mortal be 
dressed in immortality? 
The memory of  what we  were yesterday dissolves.  How could the 
present-day-personality self be dressed in immortality, if it would not be 
assimilated in the real Self? 
Now another point that we have to pay attention to.  The permanent 
personality self-aware self (the Soul self-aware self) draws up memories 
from the s�-called subconscious mind of   the present-day-personality 
self-aware self as  well as  from its  own self, the permanent personality 
self-awareness. Consequently, it  will remember whatsoever we call yes­
terday,  which is the past in this incarnation. 
Could it  penetrate in  this so-called past and bring to  surface  the 
memory of  past experiences? Yes. Pain? - Even pain. Ordeals? - Ord­
eals also. Even desperation, which was felt in  a  past incarnation, the 
present-day-personality self-awareness could relive it  with the help of 
the permanent personality self. 
So we can draw either from yesterday. the day before, or a day from 
this incarnation far a�ay in the past, or we   draw from hundred or thou­
sand years ago. We draw. What  do  we draw? Nothing but memory. We 
don't revive the past, there is no revival of the past. At this moment I am 
in the present, and I am living at  present as  Life and as a  phenomenon 
of  life, I  am complete. What I call recollection from the past is reflec­
tion of this so-called recolle.ction or memory at  the present time, at this 
moment in my present now, in my  self. 
I said reflection, and I can study this reflection. Study-how? There 
are two ways. Either making use of  thoughts or  penetrating into the 
noetical body, the body of the recollection of the past. This is great work, 
which you have to get acquainted with. 
After all, what do  we  do  all  the time, in  one way or  another? We 
reflect memory into the present time. And in this present time we  are 
Words of Truth I Chapter I 2 
107 

nothing 
else but a shadow present-day-personality. However, we are the 
present-day-personality self-awareness and, at the same time, the per­
manent personality self-awa;e self -power, will, willpower and reason. 
Slowly we have to understand the concept of space and time.  It is 
a matter of concept. We have to study what is the role of the concept 
of time and the concept of space in the creation of facts and events in 
the phenomena of life and in remembering those facts and events. The 
concept of space and time plays the first role in the phenomena of life. 
What is behind all this in reality? Movement (kinesis). Kinesis gives 
us the concept of time and space. But what kind of kinesis? Whose kin­
esis? Of the material body? No. Is there kinesis within the recollection 
of events? Is this kinesis thought? When we have a thought it proceeds 
from the beginning to a certain result, a conclusion - is it not kinesis 
within time as well as within space? What kind of space is that? At this 
moment I  am sitting on my chair,  I  have my eyes closed, I have this 
thought and I meditate. Which space are we talking about? This space 
is giving me again a concept of time and of a confined space. 
I will give you an example. We see this room. We know the space 
which this room occupies. It is so many cubic feet.  We can stand up 
and walk with our material body within this space.  When we close our 
eyes - knowing completely what this space looks like -, we will become 
conscious of this space and it becomes a part of our self-awareness. We 
close  our  eyes and  move  within this  confined space  of certain cubic 
feet. 
In which space does an architect move when he perceives his arch­
itectural project in his thoughts, even before drawing it on a paper. In 
which space is  he moving? He is moving within the concept of space 
and he can see in this confined space that it must be so many cubic feet. 
In his thoughts he can live in this room even before he drew it on the 
paper. For him it is a reality. God help him, if he is not able to conceive 
this reality through visualization. 
Visualization is a work within the concept of time and space,  but 
somewhat different from what we know in the three-dimensional world. 
Yet, when we meditate, don't we still have the impression of the three­
dimensional world? We have to  study  all this when we  meditate and 
make introspection. It is a great and scientific work. We should not start 
to meditate and create noetical images, which reach the surface of our 
consciousness from the subconsciousness, without knowing their relat­
ion to the concept of time and space. 
108 

Otherwise we would not  be able  to extend these images, to  know 
them and to govern them. They would escape from our perception. How 
about later, when we have to materialize these images? In materilization 
the  transportation of these noetical images plays the main role.  This is 
kinesis. It is a matter of certain vibrations, and frequencies of vibration 
of the so-called elementals, which are coming from the noetical world, 
the  world of  thoughts,  into the three-dimensional world, the world of 
matter. This is materilization. So I gave you the mechanism. The oppos­
ite happens for dematerilization.

CHAPTER 13 
Faith, Ratioiiality, Ethers, Visualization 
You cannot have faith without a strong foundation, without first having 
felt a strong WISH and WILL to know the truth. 
How could anyone have faith if he had never had a sincere yearning 
for truth and the willpower to pursue his aim. 
This willingness, this willpower to pursue the aim of getting to know 
the truth and the effort and the work towards knowledge of the truth are 
an indispensable foundation of faith. 
We have to work; we always have to look for the truth. This is necess­
ary because faith is the result of knowledge and experience. We  cannot 
believe in something if we  are not convinced that this something is true. 
Let us suppose, for example, that someone comes to us and tells us 
that we have to believe something. It would be very unwise to accept it 
blindly as truth. And even if he had the charisma to convince us and we 
accepted it as the truth, it would be a false faith, a faith without founda­
tion that would dissipate as soon as the first doubts arise. 
Rational thinking and experience are  essential if we  want to  have 
the faith that Joshua meant when he said, "If you have faith as a mustard 
seed, you will say to the mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will 
move; and nothing will be impossible for you." 
What does rationality or rational thinking mean? It is what we con­
sciously consider to be logical and true at any given time. But this ration­
ality cannot stand the test of time. 
If we  had said to a person a hundred years ago that there was a box 
with a glass in front, which you could connect to a plug of electricity in 
the wall, press a button, and then you could see images and events that 
happened that very moment thousands of  miles away,  -  how could you 
expect him to  believe you. The rational thinking of  his  time would not 
have allowed him to understand and believe. 
110 

The rational thinking of a man at any given point in time depends on 
the experience and the knowledge he has acquired until then. 
We as researchers of the truth do not rely on the so-called rational 
thinking of our time,  nor do we rely on our own limited experience of 
today. We have to make allowance for a great deal of research. 
No teacher of the truth insists that anything he knows is the absol­
ute  truth; nor  should you  insist on knowing everything. Whatever we 
know, we have  to know  from experience,  our own experience or from  a 
trustworthy teacher who has made his own experiences. 
Addressing future psychotherapists I usually say,  maybe there is a 
man with a wound in his material body as a result of an accident or some 
other cause. A good psychotherapist will move his hand over the wound 
- or this may not even be necessary - he simply looks and formulates 
a strong wish and the wound will heal up.  The rationality, or rational 
thinking, of the general public cannot accept it, nor can today's scient­
ists,  because they do not know what happens, they have no scientific 
explanation for the healing. They do not know what the etheric double 
is, what the kinetic, the creative and the aesthetic ethers are.  How can 
we explain to them what the power involved is, what the power of visu­
alization is? They do not know. Consequently,  it would be wrong and 
deceiving to accept the rationality of the general public. 
Some of you may have witnessed such phenomena. Such phenom­
ena  were  witnessed at  the  time  of  Christ. And  many Saints of  our 
churches have also performed such phenomena. 
How  many so-called Christians today accept so-called miracles? 
Most people do not believe in miracles and those who say that they have 
witnessed a miracle are called swindlers and liars. But. .. still. .. miracles 
do happen. 
So, we have to bear in mind that rationality is essential to the build­
ing up of the structure of faith, but it must be rational thinking that goes 
beyond the rationality of the general public. 
There is a difference between the deficient thinking of the so-called 
rational man of the general p�blic and the more rational and better think­
ing of a researcher of the truth. But then we have to remember that in the 
future -with the gaining of new experiences -WE ALL improve the way of 
our rational thinking, so that the difference will never remain the same. 
Consequently, we should be tolerant because we do not possess every­
thing and we do not know everything. Lend a helping hand and "be ye 
perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect." 
Words of Truth I    Chapter I 3 
II I 

We have said that real rational thinking is necessary for the devel­
opment of the so-called faith. Then we need a strong wish and will to 
realize and to use that phenomenon we call faith. 
Faith can only be strengthened by experience. The power of faith is 
expressed by the present-day-personality self-aware self.  - For the per­
manent personality and the self-aware Soul there is no question of faith. 
- Therefore we have to work with our present-day-personality self-aware 
self. We have to teach it to learn from our experiences, and in the end, 
when it is  cleansed, it will assimilate with the  permanent personality. 
This is a reality. 
We  said that first we need the will for  right thinking, for real ration­
ality. Then we must have willpower, we must gain experience, we must 
learn from our experiences and gain real rationality and, in time, we will 
achieve a faith that nobody can take away from us. It is not easy, at first, 
to put the enormous power of the belief we call faith into practice. But 
for a real psychotherapist healing work will,  in time and with practice, 
become easier. In the beginning you will feel unsure, you will be faced 
with  seemingly never ending work, but through practice you will gain 
experience which, in turn,  will  strengthen your  faith. Faith in  what? 
Faith, what is faith? 
Christ  spoke of a  faith  that moves mountains, but most of all he 
spoke of a faith that heals us,  that lifts us up, that puts us right, that 
edifies. 
Some have trained themselves to  work with the aesthetic and the 
kinetic ethers etc. They manage to move objects, without knowing what 
they  are doing. Here we  have  the phenomena of telekinesis or levita­
tion or any other phenomenon practised in seances. Those who witness 
the moving objects believe, but I do not call this belief faith. I call this 
an experience of  the  ability to  use hypnotism, to  use  the  kinetic and 
aesthetic ethers and to produce phenomena. We can produce such phe­
nomena without having faith. They  are useless, absolutely useless for 
us. They are even dangerous for those who know nothing at all. 
Now, what do  we  call  faith? Christ talked about the  faith  that 
moves mountains, but he showed his disciples many different phen­
omena. They saw how he raised the dead, they saw how he material­
ized etheric vitality of a deserted place and how he fed with five loaves 
and two fishes five thousand people and there remained twelve bas­
kets full of  fragments. This the  disciples saw,  they realized and they 
were amazed. 
112 

But one night in Gethsemane he explained to them how this came 
a
bout. He talked about the ethers and the etheric vitality and the power, 
which is within each of us. - This is the power that Christ felt going out 
of him when a woman touched the border of his robe and was healed of 
a haemorrhage. The disciples heard and learnt a lot. 
Some listened to Christ with attention; some fell asleep. Yiohannan 
did not have to learn all this .. He knew everything already since he was 
an Archangel. Yiacoub and Philippos and some  other  disciples had to 
pay a lot of attention to understand and to learn. What about Petros? 
Did he have faith? Sometimes he had faith, sometimes he lost faith. But 
Christ often urged him to have faith. 
What did they think when Christ demonstrated the phenomenon 
of walking on the water? They were amazed, they were stunned. They 
were in the open sea when he approached them walking on the water. 
Did he do it to frighten them or did he do it to impress them? Neither. 
They  had never  seen  this  phenomenon before, so  it  was part of his 
teaching. 
How  dia  Christ manage to  walk  on  the  water  without sinking) 
Through his willpower Joshua could either overcome the gravitational 
pull of the earth, or make his material body lighter so that he could walk 
on the water. But there is a third way known to us. Man can levitate and 
move through the air. With a little exercise, you all can do it. However, 
this is not our aim. Our purpose is different. 
Etheric vitality and faith should benefit our fellow human beings. If 
and when such a phenomenon is necessary, for instance in healing work, 
you will be given the authority to do it. 
When  Petros saw Christ walking on the water, he became excited 
and said, "Lord, can I also come to you? I can do it too." Then Christ said 
to Petros, "Come then" and Petros started walking on the water towards 
the Lord.  Suddenly he lost faith and started to sink. Then Joshua took 
him by the hand and reprimanded him. Why did he reprimand him?  If 
it had not been part of the teaching, why would he reprimand Petros 
and why would Joshua, the God-man, ask Petros to walk on the water? 
So, talking about faith: Firmness of faith is gained from experience 
coupled with firm reasoning and willpower. And we use  this power to 
further strengthen the faith within us. 
For us the power of the will and the power of faith are the same. 
When you proceed, you will come to realize that for you the two powers 
are also the same.

CHAPTER 14 
Physical Body, Spirit-Soul-Self, Personality, Egoism, 
Visualization, Archangels 
A human being is born into this gross material world as a child, eithl:'r a 
boy or a girl. That child knows nothing as a personality; as a person. Its 
material body is living; living instinctively. It searches. for the breast of 
the mother to get its milk. Looking at the material body of a little baby. 
a boy or a girl, we will understand that it is a body, a gross material body 
which is living. It is living, it is a phenomenon of life, living in a gross 
material human form. It grows and grows. You all had been babies, chil­
dren, and you grew up and became adults. We all came into this gross 
material world - we were and we are living instinctively. 
What do I mean by  instinctively?  What is instinct? Our material 
body  lives instinctively from our babyhood to the time we pass away -
early  or late in old age. This is the life of the gross material body - it 
lives instinctively. Our material body is not our self. But slowly, slowly 
our latent real life - our real life as  Spirit-Soul-Ego-Being - is  being 
manifested more and more in this gross material body. 
It is manifested..:. manifested from where? For something to appear 
and be manifested means that this something "is'" and "exists" (two' dif­
ferent things!). Now, our being, our Spirit-Ego-Soul-Self is also existing: 
part of it is existing in the gross material body  creating our time-and­
place personality. 
The 
gross material bodies, all the gross material bodies of men and 
women, are basically the same.  It does not matter if the fellow is tall or 
short, the body is basically the same in form: bones, flesh, skin, organs, 
blood, hair and all that - it is  basically the same. And this gross mate­
rial body  is not very  different from the gross material bodies of all the 
animals as far as its constitution is concerned, the way it is built up. 
We have seen that we ARE not our material body, but we HAVE a ma­
terial body which is growing instinctively. By whom? By  the holy Arch-
Words of Truth I Chapter 14 
115 

angels of the elements who had built it, starting from the spermatozoon, 
and who continue to sustain it, in accordance with the divine plan con­
cerning the human being. That means the human beings are subject to 
their circle of existence and their possibilities, from which they cannot 
escape. We  all  have to  live  in  our  circle of the  human possibilities as 
long  as we are living in a gross material body. 
So, we see now a new condition: The gross material body continues 
to live instinctively under the care of the Lords of the elements, the holy 
Archangels of creation. But now the human being begins to manifest a 
self, a time-and-place self, in the gross material body, and of course in 
the other bodies, invisible to the human eyes. 
Now, the material bodies are not in need of a name; they are simply 
human bodies of a male or a female person. The body is not in need of 
any  name. But now this new time-and-place personality, starting its own 
life in a gross  material  body, needs a name in order to exist. And there­
fore from childhood each man or  woman is  getting a  name, a  female 
name or a male name, to which they respond, on which they concentrate 
and  around which they create. And of course when this  kind of time­
and-place self develops, he or she begins to be aware of the gross mate­
rial body. 
With the  creation in  the  human form of  a  condition in  time-and­
place, the human being expresses, apart from the name, subconsciously 
now, its real self, adding to that name "I". Therefore when you ask some­
one, a boy  or a girl, after the infant is growing up and up, and also later 
in life - "Who are you?" - the person, a man or a woman, will say, "I am" 
and then give his or her name. This "I am" is common to all human be­
ings. It is what we call our selfhood, now wrapped with a human name 
of a man or a woman. That person wrapped or covered with a name of 
a man or a woman creates a kind of existing personality, a new entity in 
time-and-place - each one very different from the other. 
Now we can study and see the difference between the personalities 
of human beings; study the way  they are living subconsciously and their 
possibilities. Possibilities in what? We have a circle of human possibil­
ities. Possibilities for whom? For the material body? Of course, the ma­
terial body must go on living and complete its circle of possibilities as a 
human body. And that is common to all:  undergoing illnesses, changes, 
growing and all that. We can  know and study the circle of possibilities 
of a man and of a woman and realize that there is a small difference be­
tween the circle of a man and the circle of a woman. But now we have 
116 

each 
one our real circle of possibilities, possibilities to express ourselves 
in  life - as  what now? As a  material body,  like all  the animals? We can 
study the circle of  possibilities of  any kind of  animal, of  any material 
form manifested in the animal world. 
But let  us  now see and study the circle of  possibilities of  a human 
being, of ourselves. And then we ask the question: "What are we? What 
are we in  reality? Who are we?" This circle of  possibilities of a  man is 
known only to few persons, because it includes the circle of possibilities 
of  a  human being, of  God and the Son of  Man, the human being. We 
are Gods, our Spirit-Soul-Ego-Self is  God. And It is in the circle of our 
possibilities. This is what  Joshua Immanuel the Christ was teaching his 
disciples, and especially his disciple-healers, to  show them that their 
possibilities are great, as human beings. 
What do  we discover if we study the circle of  possibilities of a hu­
man being? Many branches of  existence and modes of existence, which 
are composing what we  call our subconsciousness, our present-day per­
sonality.  Can you classify this way of  existence, can you study it?  This 
is  something the animals cannot do. How can we do that? We are privi­
leged, we are granted by  God, Alaha, the use of the Supersubstance of 
Mind. And using it in the right way, by reasoning, we can reach the truth 
as  to  what we are. We just have to  do  this: Use Mind now consciously 
or  rather self-consciously and seriously. You may say,  "Are we not using 
Mind all the time?" Yes, indeed you are using it, but how? Subconscious­
ly,  just living like any other ordinary human being around us  - man or 
woman - subconsciously,  very often without knowing of  its  existence. 
We did not know that we are using that Supersubstance of Mind. We did 
not even know that it.existed. Thus you are living subconsciously. How? 
By manifesting one branch of the possibilities of a living human be­
ing. Which is what?
_ 
Feeling,  desiring, having desires, expressing desires. 
For what? 
This is  a  question which we have to study exhaustively.  First of all, 
what 
is desire? Why do  I  desire? What do  I  really want? How do  I  un­
derstand my desire to have this or that? Do people really think why they 
desire this or that? No, they simply desire.  They are after desires. They 
are 
enslaving divine Mind Supersubstance to serve their desires, to help 
them 
find ways and means to  gain possession of  the things they think 
they 
desire, to be able to own them and call them "their property." So we 
have to study this branch of the life of a human being which we may call 
"desiring to have." 
Words of Truth I Chapter 14 117 

Then we go further in this branch of study.  We have to see what we 
call "feelings and emotions.". Are emotions and desires the same?  Not 
exactly, they belong to the same nature, but they are not the same.  De­
siring is not exactly what we call emotion though sometimes they have 
the same effects. 
We have said that we have to study emotions using Mind (not as 
slaves of desires). And what do we find out? Just as the desires became 
the masters of Mind in the previous case, we find out that now we make 
our emotions and feelings the masters of Mind. When we study our emot­
ions, especially in the relations between human beings, we will see in 
the time-and-place personal self of ours the appearance of an illegitimate 
self called "egoism." Here is the danger: we are now creating an idol. We 
become idolaters of the worst kind of idolatry.  And we call the idol, that 
we ourselves make, our self, while it is not our self; it is the personality's 
egoism. But because we don't see it, we don't know much about it. And 
we consider this idol (we may call it a  human demon) to be our self and 
this makes us blind to the reality. But now we see clear. We become the 
masters of this demon, this human demon of our whole life. We realize 
that this demon has all the time satisfied ITS desires and emotions (while 
we thought them to be OUR desires and emotions), and at the same time 
it has enslaved Mind Supersubstance to serve its desires and emotions. 
This needs much study. We must now find out how to PROPERLY use 
Mind Supersubstance. We? Who  are we? This question arises because 
the human demon, called human egoism, always appears to say "I am 
you." You see, it does not say, "I am I," because then we would discover 
that it is not our self. It says, "I am you," and we feel being double. This 
is the point to start our self-analysis: who are we, who are you? Then we 
discover our DUAL self in the worlds of existence, in the gross material 
world. And we find out, and we know, that everything in this gross mater­
ial world is dual. And if one of these dual selves is the real one -the 
other is its shadow, and therefore not real. 
Now, our Soul-Ego-Self (not yet  the Spirit) gets hold of the egoism 
and says, "Well, you are right, I am you, for the time being, as a time­
and-place self, because unless I am in you, you will not exist." 
So we see that even in the personality of a  human being, of a  man 
or a woman, is the Soul, is God, but latent. What is manifested now 
is the time-and-place  petty self with its transgressions and faults. And 
our Soul-Ego-Self, latent in us, allows the time-and-place new self to 
appear. Therefore, when somebody is asking you - you as Mary,  Helen, 
I 18 

George or John - "What are you?'',  your answer is that you are both, the 
Soul-Ego-Self and your personality's egoism, both in  one. 
Now, how much of the egoism, of the time-and-place self dominates 
in this self? And how much control over the time-and-place self is  exer­
cised by the Soul-Ego-Self? You must study this. Who is  studying it? 
It is not difficult to find this out by introspection or "looking within." 
Just examine and study your behaviour,  your feelings, the way you are 
thinking: Having in your hand a torch, namely "why:" I  want to know the 
truth. In the light of this burning torch we can understand the truth. 
Why do I  want that? Why do I  desire to have and possess that? Why 
am I  thinking like that? The "why" is  the burning torch. But be careful. 
the petty self is trying to take that "why" from your hands, saying to you, 
"Why should I NOT have that? Why should that fellow be more lucky 
than I am?" Therefore, we must be careful. Do not allow tne present-day 
egoism to take that burning torch of the Mind, we call "why," from your 
hands, from your Soul-Ego-Self. 
I  am showing you now the real conditions you have to search for in 
your subco"iisciousness in order to find out, who you are. Who is  now 
studying, searching, trying to find out the truth? 
As seekers of the truth you are given the exercises of introspection. 
When you retire in the evening, be alone and quiet, try to  be completely 
calm. Calm all emotions, and all desires, and all kinds of thoughts, ex­
cept one thought: I want to know the truth now, using my divine powers 
which until now I have neglected. I am using them now. I mean visualiza­
tion. Visualizing means seeing persons, events, places and things around 
me. You use it  all the time, yet you do not study that divine power of 
your  Soul. Now you have to use it  consciously. Bring to your mind, by 
visualization, what is  in your subconsciousness. There may be an event 
which had happened a few hours ago, in  the house, in the market, in  the 
office, anywhere. Maybe you met some people. Maybe you had a  quarrel, 
a misunderstanding, maybe you exchanged hard words. Now you can see, 
I mean remember  everythin.g. The egoism will come to you and say,  "you 
will remember what you think is  in your interest. The hard words you 
have heard, you can remember very easily,  but you ·do not remember the 
hard words you have said yourself." "No, no, no," you will have to protest, 
"I  want to see the whole event, exactly as it  happened: what happened, 
what I  said, and what I heard the other person say." 
Study this introspection to see clearly the whole event, the persons, 
the faces, the scenery,  the place, the people coming there. You can do it, 
Words of Truth I Chapter 14 
119 

but not as the egoism of the present-day-personality.  The  egoism can­
not do it. Now you are working as your Soul-Ego-Self. You are now in 
control. Yet when you study the situation and see the persons involved, 
the egoism will appear again and again to argue its case, to present ex­
cuses for its behaviour, pretending that it was your behaviour. It needs 
continued introspection; try to separate your dual self: the personality's 
egoism and your real Soul-Ego-Se1f. At this point you should be very 
careful. It is the most precious moment for you: In introspection, "I 
heard these things said to me - hard words, yes - and what did I say 
in reply? I  said this and that - Should I  have said that? What was the 
result of saying that? Creating more confusion, more trouble?" Then 
the egoism will appear (because I am telling you: your egoism is clever 
in its own way, but in reality,  it is stupid. It cannot suspect that you are 
trying to track it down) and it will say,  "Yes, of course, but you heard 
him ... why did he say that to you. You had the right to say that to him." 
CATCH HIM!  "Now I  GET YOU. You are not me and I  am not you. And 
the one who was behaving like that at that moment was not me; now I 
see things clearly and I  can reason. At that moment you found me just 
not expressing my Self and you took control and behaved in a  stupid 
way." 
So the most precious thing in introspection is to try to understand 
who you really are, as a  thinking, reasoning being. You are a  thinking 
and reasoning Soul-Ego; checking, studying, able to control that human 
demon who is your personality. 
The quality of this human demon depends on the person - because 
the human demon, the egoism is  not the same for all the people. It may 
range from very bad to extremely bad, criminal, less bad and so on. You 
will right now try to find out the quality of your egoism. I am telling you, 
the egoism is very clever now - to fight - fight whom? You? Don't allow 
it. It  will masquerade as repenting and willing to change its attitude.  Do 
not allow it to make you present yourself in this way - as a masochist. 
You should be careful in every step you take in introspection, be­
cause I am telling you, the egoism of your personality, of the personal­
ity of every other human being, is stupid in its ways, but cunning, very 
cunning. Shall we fight it? Kill it? Never, because we can never kill any 
elemental. Once created it will exist forever,  active or inactive in the 
Cosmic Consciousness. To kill an elemental, any elemental you have 
created (and the sum total of elementals you call your personal egoism) 
is  impossible. But what can you do now? Transmute the personality ego-· 
120 

ism into your Self, because after all ITS LIFE IS vou. It can only exist and 
manifest itself because you are in it as its pulse of life. 
What you have to do is de-energize in your personality -what we call 
-evil or negative elementals and transmute what you can into your own 
Soul-Self. And this is the instance when Joshua Immanuel the Christ 
said that the mortal, the present-day-personal-self, will put on immort­
ality; it will be transmuted into your Self, which is the immortal Soul­
Self of yours. And the changeable will become unchanged, everlasting. 
So, you don't have to kill what you call your personal self (because 
you can't), just transmute it. In the beginning, I am telling you, it will 
react terribly. But when you convince that self that it is good for it, for 
this egoism, to be transmuted into your immortal Ego-Self, it will sur­
render. 
Never try to fight any elemental or the group elemental that you call 
your personal egoism. But try to  explain: use reason. It will take lime. 
but the personal self can be transmuted into your Soul-Ego-Self. This is 
the way of �e-energizing the elementals in our subconsciousness, in our 
group human demon, which we call our personal egoism. 
At the time of Joshua Immal)uel the Christ, people were consider­
ing the present-day-personality of a self as the Soul. Joshua, conforming 
to their belief and considering the present-day-personality as the Soul, 
said, "He who loves his soul (petty time-and-place self) will definitely 
lose it." Because the nature of it is change, continuous change. It is 
changing, it cannot last for a long time; he will definitely lose it. "But 
he who does not love it (he did not say hates it) will gain it," he will 
find out who he or she is "in" it. This is what he meant by his saying. 
We will come to -what we call -the true Realization of the Self, Self­
Realization. 
Self-Realization_: studying by introspection the self. Which self? In 
the beginning, the self of the personality, the time-and-place self. It 
needs analysis also. I must see it in its duality, negative and positive. I 
have to see what is good in it and de-energize what is bad in it and trans­
mute it into my Self. 
So, in the beginning we have to study the time-and-place self of 
ours, because this is also necessary for us. It will take some time; but 
then we must start to study "who we are" now as Spirit-Soul-Self. You 
can know what your material body looks like by looking in a mirror, or by 
looking into a calm pool and see yourself (your material body) reflected 
in the calm water. 
Words of Truth I  Chapter 14 
121 

How can you see your Soul-Ego-Self? By reflection? Yes, but from 
"inward out'', not from any �>Utside thing.  Saint  Paul described this in 
one of his letters, saying in Greek-in introspection "esoptro", he called 
the mirror "katoptro". And he said, to see "enesoptro", to see inside our­
selves, in our Spirit-Soul-Ego Self. How will you do it? I have shown the 
way -by introspection. In the course of time you will understand what 
the relevant power is -the power of visualizing things. 
Some  students starting to  use  visualization will  get  the  idea  that 
they are  imagining things, fancying things. Is  that the truth?  Is there 
such a thing as imagination and fantasy? Yes, of course, there is.  How? 
Looking in the surface of a pool of calm water, looking there you see the 
reflection of everything around you. Of course, what you see is only the 
reflection of something real. The reflections are not real, they are the 
shadow of the real. 
Seeing with your gross material eyes the things all around you, going 
near them, touching them, you are sure that they do exist, that they are 
there. 
Now, in introspection how can we know that we are not imagining 
things and that we are not under - what we call -imagination or fant­
asy? This question has often been asked.  Is it so difficult - to see and 
observe? Observation is one of the divine powers of your Spirit-Soul­
Ego.  Understand that the reflections on the calm water are not the real 
things, but their reflections. 
Use observation and pay attention and you can find out.  How?  By 
learning -what we call -form creating by visualization. It needs time 
for you -your time-and-place self together with your Soul-Ego-Self -to 
start seeing things. See and study: using the powers of your Soul and 
the present-day-personality self now transmuted into your Self. Yes, the 
tendency of the personal time-and-place self is imagination; but even 
that tendency shows that it has within itself the power of seeing things, 
although only the reflections. 
So, now you just have to analyze things and see them and under­
stand them.  How?  Imagine things, if you like.  See things, if you like. 
You will achieve it in the course of time -seeing. Then you will see the 
real things in the psychical plane and in the noetical plane. As we have 
presentations and  gain impressions from  the gross  material world  all 
around us, so the psychical worlds and the noetical worlds are giving us 
presentations of real things there - created and sustained by the holy 
Archangels. In the psychical world are mountains, oceans, trees; what 
122 

we see existing on the gross material plane, we will also find there, and 
many,  many more things that do not exist on the material plane. 
So, when you see things around you on the gross material plane, you 
are sure that they exist. Now,  imagining things; you can never imagine 
anything you have never seen on the material plane. Imagination is just 
repeating what has already been reflected in your subconsciousness. 
Yes, imagine, as much as you like, imagine. But with observation we will 
start to distinguish the reflection from the real thing. In the beginning, 
of course you will see things: study them. Then one day you will find 
yourself in a  situation where you will say,  "Now,  but I  am in a  world that 
is beyond my imagination. It is real. I can move in it; I can move about. I 
can use things here in the same way I was using them in the gross mater­
ial plane - with my gross material hands. Now with what kind of hands 
am I using all these things. Is this what we call the p'Sychical plane?" 
Another thing -you will see things that you could not imagine: where 
did they come from? 
Now, I !!ID telling you what is going on in introspection. Does that 
mean that you come out of your gross material body,  in what we call 
"exosomatosis", OBE out of the material body experience? Yes and no. 
Because when you develop all these powers, you will see that there are 
many ways of doing it: by expansion or by yourself going there. 
So, by observation - that is why I  used this word - through the di­
vine powers in your Soul (which the Eastern philosophy is never using) 
you will find the Truth. And you will find your Self - without any effort -
living consciously (not yet Self-consciously) in the gross material world 
and in the psychical world at the same time. For you the psychical world 
will be the next room in your house. 
"In my Father's house are many mansions," said Joshua Immanuel 
the Christ, "and I  go. to prepare a place for you." He said "a place'', does 
that mean that we need a place to live as entities,  existing as phenomena 
of life, as human beings? You see that we are still concerned with the 
question "What are we as h1,1man beings?" Is a place still necessary? The 
sense of living in a  place is in the gross material world. It is also in the 
psychical world, but in a  different way.  It is just a little  different  from 
the way you are living in the gross material world,  because that world is 
the world of four dimensions. And the concept of place in the life on the 
noetical level is still  more different. What is the difference? The sense 
of space (not place)  and time. Are there  changes in the worlds or in the 
way we conceive  things? You will find out when you start living in them. 
Words of Truth I  Chapter 14 
123 

I may say both are possible, you just have to know "when" and "where." 
But is that easy? Of course, if you reach that state of living consciously 
in those worlds, it is possible. 
Living consciously is a first step, but you have to develop still more 
your powers as Soul-Ego-Being. That means you have to study what 
your Self is -not the petty time-and-place self, but your real Self as a 
Soul. You have to manifest yourself now Self-consciously. But you have 
to do it on earth, at first. ... Are the human beings around you living 
Self-consciously? No, ninety per cent of the people living around us are 
living subconsciously -not even consciously. 
You have to learn to live consciously, paying attention and under­
standing and seeing things as they really are in the gross material world, 
so that you develop your Soul-powers to live Self-consciously. You don't 
need to live self-consciously as Helen and Mary and George and John. 
because your real Self has no name except ''I am." You are leaving aside 
now the rest -John or Mary. Because in your Soul-Self is no sex, or 
rather there are both sexes. You are not sexless. But there is something 
you feel; you complete in that Self everything that a male or a female 
person has to develop in the gross material body -which is: to balance 
emotion and thought. 
So, you are balanced in the Soul-Self-consciousness now. Then you 
understand what the real Self is; what you are. Then you understand 
that you are Gods -you and all of us, without any exception, as Spirit­
Soul-Ego-Beings. We are all offspring of Alaha. 
Well, that is a very, very nice state of feeling, knowing and being. 
But did we enter in the One-ness of God, of Alaha, or of the Logos, the 
manifestation of God in the worlds of existence? No, you still have to 
unfold, in your Soul-Ego-Self now, the Spirit-Ego-Self. Is the SPIRIT­
Ego-Self of yours human? Is the  Soul-Ego-Self of yours human? Yes, it 
is, because it is the Soul-Ego-Self which is manifesting itself as a human 
being. And it is in the Light of the divine Man. Joshua Immanuel the 
Christ had honoured Man by manifesting himself as a human being, by 
being humanized, and he called himself the Son of Man. 
So, this is our inheritance: to be, each one of us, a Son of Man. 
Yes, but can we not develop a kind of Self-Superconsciousness now, in 
order to feel, to be, and to live and manifest ourselves as Spirit-Beings? 
No, we will always manifest ourselves as Spirit-Soul-Ego-Beings. Once 
we have manifested our Self as a human being, we will always be the 
human Spirit-Soul-Self in the Light -   a God again. I didn't have any 
124 

p
ersonal experience beyond that and therefore I don't want to elaborate. 
But it could be further developed. Even so,  why not remain in the arms 
of our  Beloved One, the  Logos.  Nobody can tell you anything about the 
state of being in the Absolute Infinite Be-ness. 
Can we contact Archangels? What is the relation between Archang­
els and us? Do Archangels have a  Soul-Ego-Self? No. Do  they have an 
Ego-Self? Soul-Ego-Self, no  - but they do  have an  Ego-Self. Because 
each one has its own identity, its own beingness in the Absolute Infinite 
Beingness. Since they have never left  the  One-ness of the  Logos, they 
are not Soul-Ego-Selves. 
Is our Soul-Ego-Self responsible for making us think or  believe that 
we  have escaped from the  One-ness of  the Logos? Not exactly, but its 
reflection, the time-and-place self, which is  part of it,  is responsible fur 
that condition. 
So,  the Archangels of the elements and all of the  other Archan
g
elic 
Orders do not have a Soul, but each one has an  Ego-Archangelic Self. 
Can the  holy Archangels of  any Order know what a  human being 
knows and is, in reality? Just attuning to the Spirit-Soul-Ego of a human 
being - they do  it;  they can definitely know what a human being is.  by 
attunement and by at-one-ment (they are masters at that). Actually. they 
are  completely attuned to  our gross material body and to  all  our bod­
ies,  since they have created them - using the divine Wisdom; they arc 
sustaining them and giving them to us to live in. At least the three Arch­
angelic Orders of the  Michaels, any Michael; the  Gabriels, any Gabriel; 
the  Raphaels, any Raphael, come in  touch by  attunement and at-one­
ment (and they like it,  they love it)  with our Spirit-Soul-Ego-Selves. 
And with our  present-day personality? They don't want to,  because 
they don't want to be  contaminated by  the  idea of  separateness. They 
could do  it,  but they never do  it,  they don't like it.  Do  they like the 
present-day personallty of a human being? They call it the  Prodigal Son, 
the lost son; of course, they love us, they love it.  But they do not want to 
be attuned to George, to Mary, or to John. 
When I want to come in contact with the Archangels, do they know 
my name? They do not want to. The name they can hear and understand 
is  the vibration that the Soul-Ego-Self makes. They love it  and they 
know it.  How is  the  comprehension ability of these holy Archangels? I 
know how it operates, but I cannot express it in words. 
Do  the holy Archangels have a  language of  their own? Even Saint 
Paul knew the languages of the Archangels, because he  had raised his 
Words of Truth I    Chapter 14 
125 

Self-consciousness to the third heaven, to the noetical plane - the pure 
noetical plane. Yes, they ha_ve separate languages. What are languages? 
What is our human language? English, Greek, German, Japanese, Chin­
ese: words, meanings behind the words and sounds. So the languages of 
the human  beings are in confusion -confusing  sounds and the mean­
ings dressing them in different  ways. This is how human languages  are, 
the languages of human  beings on earth. 
But the holy Archangels' languages are only vibrations and sounds. 
All vibrations are light and sound. And the holy Archangels use different 
languages between themselves. Does a  Michael know the language of a 
Gabriel or of a  Raphael or of another Archangel? Yes, though they are dif­
ferent vibrations, conveying different colours, being in the One-ness ol 
God, they know what each one is expressing, because their languages art 
languages of Love. And through the Light of the Love of the Logos the� 
are all attuned to the Logos One-ness and they know and understand 
Can a  human being know the language of the Archangels? Yes, be­
cause the human being is privileged. By what? By attunement to them 
At-one-ment with them is very,  very difficult. But he can know. When? 
"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." You cannot hear 
the languages of the Archangels through your ears, but through your 
heart. 
When you reach that state of Self-consciousness, there is no need to 
go to Self-Superconsciousness. Being in touch with them you can know 
everything concerning them and they can know everything concerning 
you as a  human being on the Soul-Ego level. They don't want to inter­
fere with the personality of a  man -it smells very badly to them. 
So, what are we human beings -Archangels? We are Soul-gods, as 
they are Gods. And we are Archangels. Archangels humanized, mani­
festing a  Spirit-Soul-Ego-Self. 
Somebody asked me whether I was not satisfied with my being a 
Soul-Ego-Self, living in a human body. I replied resolutely that I was not 
satisfied with living in a  gross material human body.  And I added that I 
had never liked it. But that I could not say that I was not satisfied with 
living in the human form, in the substance (not in the gross matter) and 
in the Light, being human, being a Son of Man -that is really a privilege. 
But we are living in a gross material body. We should not enslave 
that part of our Soul-Self to what we call the present-day-personality 
egoistic self, believing that we are our bodies. But it does not mean that 
we should not love the human form, which we will never lose, because 
126 

by   the death of  the human body - only the human body dies. Th  is  is 
what Joshua Immanuel was preaching: You will find yourself in  your 
psychical body having exactly the same form as your material body. And 
all  the characteristics of your gross material body are in  your psychical 
body  -even if  you  have a  small sign on  your body that you like, it  will 
be there. Because the gross material body is the reflection of your self in 
the psychical body and in the noetical body of  yours. 
Love your human nature, your human form, and try to love it also in 
yo
ur gross material body.

CHAPTER 15 
The 
Gods of the Past, Elementals, Total Wisdom, Illness, Life, Emotions, 
Human Form, Visualization, Meditation, Self-Realization 
I will make a revision. 
We  said  that  what is,  is  the  Absolute Beingness in  Its  Self-suffi­
ciency, Self-abundance, eternal. This Absolute Beingness is Life. God is 
Life. 
WHAT EXISTS AND IS ALSO is the world of the manifestations. 
What is  a  manifestation and why  do  we  have that  world of  mani­
festations? The world of the manifestations is just the divine Will, the 
Will of the Absolute  Beingness. This is one of the characteristics of the 
nature of the Infinite  Beingness, Life. 
With what we  call  the  human intelligence, we  human beings can 
trace and know some of the characteristics of the nature of this Absolute 
Beingness. 
Many times people are  asking me:  "You  say  Absolute Beingness, 
Logos, Holy Spirit, and you don't use the word God. Why? " 
What can we understand by the word God? Gods have existed in all 
the centuries that have passed. What did all the people understand by 
the word God and what really  made these  people (from the caveman to 
the man of the present time) create a god, or many, many gods? Maybe 
the necessity to  feel that  there was a  higher intelligence, higher than 
their own, that could protect them. 
Was it the result of fear? Maybe. But it was not only  that. All hu­
man beings, being present-day-personalities in time and  space, had in 
themselves the feeling: "I am not that weak being which I feel I am," i.e. 
my  present-day-personality. Maybe it  was  not  only  the  fear  that  made 
human beings create a god or gods, but an inner impulse and necessity. 
Who were the gods of  the past? They were mostly what people were 
afraid of:  Lightning, tempest, Hoods, volcanoes, earthquakes. Human 
beings had to create protectors. 
128 

How did those men of old times create those protectors? Subcon­
sciously by using what we call the Mind or thought. 
Animals do not create gods or believe in gods. They simply live. The 
human beings started believing (think about the meaning of the word) 
that something or somebody existed above them who was able to protect 
them. 
What were the qualifications of those gods in the past? Studying the 
past, we see that all human beings were giving to their gods their own 
virtues or vices. They wanted a god to take revenge, even Jews with Je­
hovah. Feeling jealous of others, they thought that their god was jealous. 
So 
we see that all gods in all civilizations of the past were qualified by 
the characteristics of the people living at that time. 
Did these gods exist? Do they exist now? Yes. They existed and exist 
even now. All the gods of the Atlantians, the Lemuriani;, ti1e Old Egyp­
tians,  the Greeks, the Hindus, the Aztecs, the Incas existed and exist 
even now. Why? Because they simply were elementals, creations of the 
Mind and the human understanding and nature. 
Were those gods helping their people? A god was not only the con­
ception of one  human being.  When that god had been  presented by 
one person, many others followed, and they created what I call a group 
elemental of a god. Then thousands and thousands were giving ener
gy 
to that elemental to serve them. 
I will say something else. The old Atlantians were using what I call 
creative thought, which means that their gods could even materialize and 
do certain work. Yet they were simply elementals, collective element­
als, which are very powerful. 
When we study elementals by looking in our subconsciousness to be 
face to face with the elementals under whose pressure we are, we will 
understand that all those elementals have power and enei;gy. The gods 
in the past existed, and they exist now in the Cosmic Consciousness. 
Using the word God,  we minimize the Absolute Beingness to our 
own nature and our own measure. That is not an honour to the Infinite 
Beingness. That is why I am· not using the word God very often. Let the 
church use it and call the Absolute Beingness God the Father, God the 
Son, the expression, the Logos, and God the Holy Spirit. They are right. 
But having in our mind the past, why should we not   use better terms and 
say Absolute Beingness, Life, and give the main characteristics. And we 
said the main characteristics are kinesis, motion, vibration. These are 
the main characteristics of life. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 15 
129 

We  said  motion. Movement in  God  the  Father - let  us  use  this 
term now - is motion, law, _cause, without anything moving. Yet motion 
is there, the nature of the Absolute Beingness. In what is that motion? 
WE FIND IT AS THE WILL! 
What do we believe about God the Father or the Absolute Beingness? 
We believe that everything is in It, not Him or Her, IT with capital letters, 
as big as the universes. Everything is in It, because the Absolute Being­
ness is  expressing Itself as Total Wisdom, Total Love and Total Might. 
Certain doctrines, even Christian doctrines, put  God  the  Father 
aside and  adore only  the  expression, the  Logos. But  the  Logos is  the 
expression of the Absolute B�ingness, of the source! And the expression 
cannot be wiser than its source. Christ said: "My Father is greater than I 
am".  Christ said these things himself. So we must not put aside the Ab­
solute Beingness, the first cause, and adore only the manifestation. The 
manifestation is also the Absolute Beingness. The Logos is the Absolute 
Beingness in manifestation, expressing what we call Life, Will, Love and 
Total Wisdom. 
How can we understand and say that there is Total Wisdom in the 
Absolute Beingness? By studying things that  exist, things which have 
been manifested. 
We can detect - not conceive - the causes, and we can study and see 
the effects, the manifestation. That means we can study all the phen­
omena of life in the universes: in the material universe, in the so-called 
psychical universe, in the noetical universe or Mind universe and so on. 
How can we  detect and study Total Wisdom? I had  this  question 
the other day by a principal of a university in America. He said: "You are 
speaking about Total Wisdom. How can you be so sure about this Total 
Wisdom?" I said: "First of all, you don't believe in God." He said: "That's 
true. Why should I?" "That is another matter, why we should believe in 
God. Of course, the Absolute Beingness is not in need of you  thinking 
about It, loving It or acknowledging It. But you are in need of doing that, 
to attune yourself to that principle for your own good. Yet you don't love 
the Absolute Beingness. But the Absolute Beingness loves you; because 
you are living. Now you doubt Its Total Wisdom. As  I understand, you 
are also a doctor of medicine". He was the principal of the university.  I 
said:  "Only by studying the human body and how it functions, you will 
find this  Total Wisdom. Because life in a human body or  in any other 
living form around you functions as systems of vibration, existing in har­
mony and keeping themselves in existence. 
130 

But what is behind the harmony that you discover when you study 
the material body of a  human being, or the material body of any animal 
or any tree? You see behind it the divine Plan. I call it Total Wisdom. You 
can understand the Total Wisdom by studying the circles of existence 
and possibilities and see the 'ring-pass-not' ruling every material living 
form." He said: "Yes, but why don't you call it wisdom of nature?" "What 
does wisdom of nature mean? Definitely,  that wisdom exists in nature. 
But why don't you like the words expression of the  In.finite Beingness, 
if you don't like the word God, and give the characteristics of God to 
nature? Of course, definitely,  law reigns in nature. But  there can never 
be any law without the law giver. Who is keeping the law?" Of course, I 
brought this man to confusion, yet he did not admit that he believes in 
God. But that is his problem. 
The researcher of truth must use the Mind as reason to know, to 
learn what a human being can learn. A human being! But we are not 
only human beings. WE EXIST as human beings and WE ARE -let us  use 
the word now -Gods. Everyone as a Soul-Ego-Self-consciousness is 
God. 
-
But can a drop of water from the ocean,  co-substantial with the 
ocean, call itself the ocean? No! Yet a  drop of water is the same as the 
ocean. We are Gods and So.ns of the Almighty, says Jesus Christ. All of 
us are Gods. We ARE Gods, and we EXIST as human beings. These are 
two different things: the world of Beingness and the world of existence. 
The world of Beingness is eternal, not changing. And all beings and the 
Absolute   Beingness are in their Self-abundance and SELF-sufficiency. 
SELF-abundance and Self-sufficiency! 
Did all human l:ieings existing on the planet at all times feel that 
self-abundance and self-sufficiency, either as human beings in a  mater­
ial form,  a psychical form or a  noetical form? Of course FIOt, there is no 
self-sufficiency in the worlds of existence. Why? Human beings - being 
in the world of separateness -can never be self-sufficient. And by their 
way of living they have lost the authority to enjoy this self-sufficiency. 
Even as a human form. This is the reason for the many, many illnesses in 
the material bodies of human beings, which are consequences of violat­
ing the divine Law. 
What can a  researcher of the truth find through deep meditation, 
concentration, observation and contemplation? What can one find? The. 
main thing is: "I am using holy Supersubstance called the Mind. And if 
I use it I can know the truth. If I make bad use of it, I enter more deeply 
Words of Truth I Chapter 1 5 
131 

into the world of illusions and separateness with consequences on the 
material body, on the psychic::al body and on the noetical body." 
But can that be  forever? No.  Because we are constantly under the 
law. Today's science calls it evolution. But this word means nothing to 
me! What is evolution? What we call evolution means to come back to 
reasoning, to use the Mind in a proper way. That is what I call evolution. 
We cannot be in the darkness all the time, because we are in need 
to see the light. To see the light - how? 
We try to see the light from outside through the five senses, though 
we are  the  Light  as  Soul-Superconsciouness. We  are  the  Light  - our 
Self is the  Light, yet this  Light is covered by  material form.  And  the 
new manifestation of our Self is thirsty for light, it tries to search for the 
light, it tries to find it from the outside world. 
Christ says: "The kingdom of the heavens is within you". 
Who  cares  to  say  "what is  this  kingdom of  the  heavens which is 
within me and what does it mean that it is WITHIN ME"? As a present­
day-personality, I see the within me as my body, a heap of matter. Even if 
I study it, looking at each organ separately, I see my human body, and if 
I say within me, I think that this is in my  material body.  But that within 
me is not the material body.  Because we as Souls are not confined to a 
heap of matter. 
We are something different than one of our expressions existing as a 
human being. As LONG AS WE KNEEL BEFORE THE IDOL WE CALL EGOISM, 
we cannot see our Selves, our real Selves within. 
We can see our Selves by reflection of the three mirrors of matter, 
emotion and thought. We must turn within. And that within is spaceless 
and timeless. The illusions are due to space and time. 
Of course, we enter in very, very  deep waters now. We better come 
to our subject. 
What are we now? We must acknowledge that we are not the body. 
The body is built up most wisely by the Holy Spirit, the Creator, and the 
holy Archangels of the elements without our own help. On the contrary, 
we all the time interfere in their creative work, causing illnesses to our 
material bodies by  the way  we are living as egoistic present-day-person­
alities. 
Living in this  way,  we  are  not  using the  Mind in the proper way, 
consciously and self-consciously. What are we doing? We use it subcon­
sciously. So we don't have any serious gain, not even satisfaction in life. 
We  have no satisfaction, because we don't understand what life is and 
132 

what living in the material body and in the other bodies is. The result: 
so many suicides, so much misery, pain and illness all around us. Due to 
the misuse of the holy substance and Supersubstance of the Mind. 
Yet,  thinking a little,  we will find out that we are privileged to use 
Mind in the way we like.  We  are free to keep this water pure and clean 
and drink it to quench our thirst, or to mix it with soil and give it a bad 
smell.  By this I m ean certain emotions. 
So IF WE WANT TO, we can get rid of this illusion. Nobody is forcing 
us to be in pain and to be slaves of material and psychical conditions. 
How must we get rid of these conditions? By thinking reasonahly. 
What did these conditions offer us until now?  Did they offer us  satis­
faction in the phenomenon of life we call our present-day-personality? 
Who is really satisfied with the life he is living now? And many are ask­
ing: What is the aim of this life? 
Of course, there is a purpose and an aim to this life,  and we must 
understand it. Nothing is without cause or reason. And we shouldn't in­
sult the Tgtal Wisdom of the Infinite Beingness that is creating a mater­
ial body for us to live in and is keeping it in good health with such great 
wisdom! 
Orthodox science tries to understand what life in a material body is. 
They are in darkness yet. Some years ago they didn't even know anything 
about the circulation of the blood. Now they detect what metabolism, 
catabolism and anabolism are. 
Many times I hear the question: "Sir, what about the human form?" 
I said the human form  is the mould in which your material body  has 
been built and is being built every moment. The human form is in the 
Total Wisdom of the Infinite Beingness, of God, and we call it the Heav­
enly Man. Even if you want to get rid of it, you will never be able 'to do 
so. You are in the material form, because you have become the mater­
ial form. Even casting away your material body, your psychical body and 
your  noetical body,  you will be in  that  form,  the human form,  in the 
causal body,  in the worlc�  of  causes and  laws.  But  then  you  will  not 
be the slave of a form, of the human form. You will be a God who can 
take any form, yet keep the human form. The human form which Jesus 
Christ has honoured by calling himself the Son of Man. 
And I repeat: Calling himself the Son of Man, Christ did not mean 
the son of Joseph, because he was not the son of Joseph, he was the son. 
of God. That was misunderstood by many. He honoured the Idea of Man 
by  calling himself the Son of Man. 
Words of Truth j Chapter 1 5 
133 

WHAT IS  OUR  REAL TREASURE? No  material things can be our real 
treasure. IT  IS THE  HUMAN FORM, as  cause, idea, power, apart from a 
heap of earth. Apart from its form in material existence. 
Again we have dived into very deep waters. 
By deep meditation, concentration and observation one should reach 
-in the course of time-that stage we call "beyond-contemplation-ecstasy" 
to be face to face with the truth and understand what I mean by Idea of the 
Heavenly Man and the human form apart from time and space influences. 
"What is that form of man as you describe it now, Daskale'', you may 
ask me. "My human form star.ts from a spermatozoon, growing and grow­
ing and growing from an infant to a boy or girl, an adult, a young man, a 
grown-up man, and then an old man. And you speak about the Circle of 
Possibilities regarding the human being. In which state of that growth is 
my human form  which I can keep?" 
THE WHOLE CIRCLE OF POSSIBILITIES, EVERYTHING EXISTING IN THE 
HUMAN NATURE -we  call it nature -IS THE  FORM. And that is  beyond 
time and space. You are everything that can exist or  existed as you as  a 
human being. Your human form is not only confined to a certain moment 
of your life in the material body.  But can we be, let's say, a  young man of 
20 and, if we like it, the next moment a wise man of 40? Yes. When you 
reach that state of development you are everything and you can express 
yourself as you want. Of course. 
You must understand the  Idea of Man or the human form that you 
are  now  as  a  Soul-Superconsciouness. The  Idea  of  Man, that  is  the 
difference between the Soul-Superconsciouness and yourself as Spirit­
Self-Superconsciouness. 
THE  CHARACTERISTIC OF  THE  IDEA OF  MAN IS  ITS  EXPRESSION AS 
THE SouL, Goo. You are divine, even as a Soul. 
We said  that  the Absolute Beingness is and exists in three expres­
sions. Maybe there are  many,  many more, but  we  cannot understand 
more, WE  CAN  ONLY UNDERSTAND THE  THREE EXPRESSIONS WHICH WE 
ARE. Maybe the Archangels understand things in a different way. We can 
understand what we are. 
WE ARE as the Spirit-Ego-Self-Superconsciouness and WE ARE AND 
EXIST as an Ego-Soul-Self-Superconsciouness and WE EXIST as a present­
day-personality with the in-between permanent personality, which is our 
expression in time and space and in the worlds. 
Summarizing previous lessons, I  say  that  everything is  and  exists 
due to the Supersubstance we  call  Mind. All the universes -the noeti-
134 

cal,  the psychical and the material universes - are made of  Mind. The 
material universe, the whole galaxy, and all the galaxies and what we call 
space are little molecules MOVING in that ocean we call Mind. 
THEY ARE MOVING, BECAUSE MOTION IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF LIFE. 
Mind is not the handful of brain in the skull. The Mind is the Will 
and the Total Wisdom of the Infinite Beingness. But Mind is not God. 
It is not even the expression of the Infinite Beingness as the Logos. Yet 
the Logos and the Holy Spirit use it to create. 
Everything that exists is made of Mind, of Mind matter, Mind sub­
stance or  Mind Supersubstance. Accidentally,  by chance? No.  By  obey­
ing the Total Wisdom of the Infinite Beingness as the cause of the exist­
ence of everything. 
Now we know that the Mind IS. What more can we know? That we 
can use the Mind. Common people are not using the Mind consciously. 
What else do we know? That all the orders of the holy Archangels 
are using the Mind by  using what we call creative thought, and ever)'· 
thing they_ create is existing. Are all the orders of the holy Archangels -
divine beings, Gods - eternal? Yes, they are. They have their Archangelic 
self-consciousness. 
Why  is man not able to use this creative thought and do what the 
Archangels are  doing, that  means materializing their  thought-forms, 
their elementals, since man is also a God equivalent to the Archangels? 
Every human being is an Archangel. The church is calling the hu­
man beings "Fallen Archangels". I don't agree with this characteristic. 
No, we are not fallen; because when we return back home, we are in a 
better position than any of the Archangels of the elements. 
Can we use the
. 
Mind as creative thought to materialize things as 
the holy Archangels are materializing their thought-forms and creafe the 
world we see and Hve in? Yes. At some time, man had that privilege. But 
he has made bad use of it, and he has been deprived of this privilege for 
some time. Looking at the history, we can see that in the past they were 
making wars amongst themselves by  using the elements, casting fire by 
thought. You can read it in the Old Testament. They made very, very bad 
use of the creative power of thought. 
By whom have they been deprived of that right? They have lost it, 
because they  made bad use of it.  Can they  have it back some day? Yes, 
of course, when they deserve to have it back. 
Can human beings materialize things from the Mind? Jesus Christ 
came  and  said:  "See  what  I  do.  The  one  who  has  faith  as  little as a 
Words of Truth I Chapter 15 
135 

mustard seed can move mountains. He can do what I do and greater 
things". You can read it in the New Testament in the sayings of Christ. 
He came just to say who we really are. This is what Christianity means 
in reality. Not what we call Christianity today as dogmas. It is better not 
to use any other characteristics, to avoid mentioning criminality and 
killing. 
But how can we come to that point? By first acknowledging who we 
are. By knowing that we are not what we think we are as.the egoism. By 
knowing that our present-day-personality's egoism is the sum total of the 
elementals we have  cast or revitalized. By studying the nature of these 
elementals which we call emotions. Our emotions as they are today are 
elementals persuading us to revitalize them. 
After finding out that we are not what we think we are - that means 
the present-day-personality expressing a  time and space egoism that is 
behaving in an insane way - we find our way. 
Our way whereto? In religion, one will say "back home". What does 
"back home" mean? Where is this "back home"? On some other planet? 
There are many people who think that evolution is going to other planets. 
All other planets are material heavenly bodies as the earth, and noth­
ing 
more than that! It is not necessary to change place in the outside 
environment, BUT TO  CHANGE PLACE IN  THE  KINGDOM OF  THE HEAVENS 
WITHIN US. 
Maybe it  is the first time you hear the word 
"
CHANGING PLACE WITH­
IN  us
"
. What does it mean when we say we have the place where we 
live,  outside of us, outside of our material body,  and we have time  and 
place within us? What is that "within us"? Definitely not any place in the 
material body,  in the lungs, the brain or the abdomen. That is not the 
"within us". 
Christ says: "The kingdom of the heavens is within us". This is not de­
fining any part of the material body or any place inside the material body. 
So to find who we are, we must understand what is time as an illu­
sion, space again as an illusion, and what is that within us, the nature 
of our Soul. First we must carefully study the behaviour of our present­
day-personality. We must do this without starting to accuse the egoism, 
because the egoism is  doing that with its masochistic tendencies to take 
us out of our way. Our real Soul-Ego-Self-consciousness is an independ­
ent master of the truth. 
We must start to study. Who are "we?" We as we really are, not as 
a man or as a woman, but as a  present-day existence beyond the influ-
1_�6 

ences of time and space. Yet a  most powerful intelligence, I would say, 
who can know the truth. Not by reflection from outside, but  by using 
the Mind, by introspection. Because I tell you, your inner space is  not 
smaller than the outer  space, that you can understand. 
To return back home means to enter in the Self-Realization, know­
ing who we are. We are not in need of moving or placing our body any­
where else. 
Moving - can you understand what "movement in  time" means and 
not "in place"? You will know it  after deep meditation, concentration, 
observation and ecstasy.  And through introspection. Then you will un­
derstand what this "space within you" is, and "movement in  time within 
you." That is  very different from the time you conceive from outside 
events through the five senses. How will you understand the difference? 
Of course I cannot explain it to you, you have to  do it•and get the know­
ledge directly yourselves. Daskaloi or masters or Gurus or Avatars, call 
them whatever you like, can show you the way.  But you have to walk 
yourself! _ 
As I said in previous lessons, a  guide (that is  a  better term than 
Daskalos) will give you his hand. Take it. He will walk with you some 
distance. But he will not carry you on his shoulders. Don't expect that. 
You have to do these things. Yes, he can hold in his hand the torch of 
light and truth. Good. Get advantage of that and walk to find the truth! 
What is  the truth now? Nobody can tell you what the truth is. You 
must find it! Of course, I can tell you that you are the truth as a Spirit­
Self-Superconsciouness. But you have to realize it. Nobiidy t::an explain 
to you what it is  unless you find out by at-one-ment, becoming one with 
the truth. 
Can we say that these are various stages of consciousness and self­
consciousness? 
This is  the point I want you to pay attention to: various stages of 
consciousness, yes. We have subconsciousness including  instinct, sensi­
bility,  consciousness in  the state of understanding things, and even what 
I call Superconsciouness. These are stages of consciousness. 
But there is only one self-consciousness. There cannot be two stages 
of self-consciousness. And the self-consciousness is the realization of "I 
am I", whether dressed in female or male garments, as a woman or as a 
man. That "I am I" means realizing that you are the Soul-Self-conscious-. 
ness. And then  afterwards in ecstasy you will feel that you are the Spir­
it-Self-Superconsciouness. This   means that you can be self-conscious 
Spoken Words  I C liapter I 5 
137 

everywhere, not in a certain place. And at all times, not in the present, 
past and future, but in what_ I call the eternal now.  Which means real­
izing that you are God. The ocean? It is not necessary to feel that you 
are the ocean. It is enough to feel that you are a drop of water from the 
ocean. And then understand that you are co-substantial with the ocean. 
Let us come back again. We are privileged to use the formless Su­
persubstance of Mind to shape it into what we call elementals - mental 
thought-forms or emotional thought-forms - and to study the nature and 
the quality of our  emotions. This is  the  way.  There is no  other way to 
reach what you call Self-Realization. 
But does  everyone have  the  wish  to  tread  this  path  of seeing the 
truth, freeing himself from the illusions of space and time? Shakespeare 
said:  "If ignorance is bliss,  it is stupid to  be  wise". If he   wishes to  be 
stupid, let him be stupid. 
But I say that ignorance can never be bliss.  It cannot even give us 
what we call temporary satisfaction. 
"DASKALE, GIVE us A  PRACTICAL WAY TO  START WITH''. This is plain! 
Start checking your emotions. Start checking to know your present-day­
personality's behaviour, that means see the quality of your egoism. Be­
cause there is no other way to get rid of that egoism. 
"KILLING THE EGOISM IS  NOT ENOUGH. SHOW US  A  WAY TO  DO  IT". 
You are not just going to get a dagger and stab someone to kill egoism. 
You cannot do that to egoism. But you can kill egoism by taking away 
from it the force of its illusion. The egoism will die of suffocation if you 
don't give it energy to live any longer. This is a practical way. 
Now the Eastern Schools are giving various meditations. They are 
good for some purpose, yes. But I say they are aimless, going around and 
around and  around for years  and years. Many have  practised medita­
tion as pointed out in books or by a Yogi or somebody,  going around and 
around and around. I ask them: "What is the result of it? Did you man­
age to master the Mind in this way?" No. So using the meditation meth­
od,  we should have positive results which lead to Self-Realization. We 
have meditation, concentration, contemplation and all the other things, 
to use the Sanskrit terms, Samyana, Dhyana, Samadhi. You can find this 
in  books. But  you must use the right  method to get the  benefit of it. 
What benefit? To  use  the  Mind consciously.  What is  the  aim  of 
meditation, concentration, or observation? Just to become master of the 
Mind. So you   will  train yourself in visualization, which means casting 
and  projecting living thought-forms under your command. Are  the el-
138 

ementals you are creating every day under your  command? Or  are  you 
under their command and their influence? 
By visualization, which is an art of meditation you must use, you get 
mastery over the Mind. And what is the benefit of it?  (Because human 
nature wants to have a gain from what one is doing ... ) Well, becoming the 
master of the Mind, you are the master of everything, especially if you are 
able to materialize and dematerialize. You can do anything you like, mate­
rialize everything you want to materialize.  But now you will hear a voice 
from within you -after killing the egoism: "What are you doing that for?" 
The  holy  Archangels are  materializing in  your material  body from 
what you  call  energy. You  see  everywhere materialization done by  the 
highest intelligences. Now free  from your egoism, you can  materialize 
according to the will of God, which means giving help to other people if 
they have exhausted their debt, if they have paid most'of their debt. You 
become a real mental healer. Do you think that is not enough? It is! 
Is working with living matter in a sick material body not better th;m 
materializi_!lg things that people around us call precious things? - Why) 
So in every step we must have the torch of reason and work under tht­
light of reason and  say:  "The holy  Supersubstance of the  Mind should 
not  be  used stupidly,  but  be  approached with the  right reverence to­
wards the Will of the Infinite Beingness and Its divine Plan." 
We are Christians. We are in need of many, many things to live in the 
society as we live now. Are we allowed to ask favours from the Infinite Be­
ingness, from the Logos or from the Holy Spirit? Why favours? The Ab­
solute Beingness is not favouring a few and leaving other� outside of I ts 
favour! Anyone can ask for   what one is in need of, and trust the  Infinite 
Wisdom. Because we don't believe much in that, Christ told us lo even 
ask for our daily bread. Of course, he did not mean a loaf of bread, out he 
meant the vital ene.rgy we all live in.  "Give us this day our daily bread". 
God is not in need of our asking Him to give us our daily bread, because 
He is giving it!  But by saying so, we convince ourselves that we will have 
it. Whatever we do in prayer is for us,  not for the Absolute  Beingness. 
Then what did he say next? Ask for whatever you want to have or you 
are in need of having, and that will be given to yot1. Knock, and it will be 
opened to you. Search, and  you shall  find. But how?  By using the Mind! 
That's the gate. 
Subconsciously, we  are  creating many, many elementals day  and. 
night.  Elementals are forming our egoism and the  sum total of our el­
e
mentals is our present-day-personality. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 15 
139 

What is an elemental supposed to do? To give us what we desire or 
wish to have.  And I tell  you:  All desires and all wishes  will be fulfilled 
some time. If they are not fulfilled at the time we want them to be ful­
filled, it is because we don't give them time to work. We  project them, 
bring them back, project them, bring them back, again and again, and 
when we are tired of doing so and leave them, they will do what they 
have been created for.  Most of you will say: "A wish has been fulfilled, 
but it didn't come at the time I wanted it." 
You will notice that all your reasonable wishes have been fulfilled, 
but not at the time you wanted. This  is your own  fault,  because you 
didn't give them time to work for you. 
Have this in mind:  When you want to send a reasonable desire or 
the wish to have something, then you must build it accurately by visuali­
zation. Close your eyes and see it. You must get the skill of visualization. 
That isn't fantasy or imagination, but creative thought; we must separate 
these two things. See the thing you desire, ask, and it will be given to 
you! 
But have this in mind:  Before desiring to have something, see that 
it is a reasonable thing, and pay attention that it will not be a stumbling 
stone in your way when it comes to you, so that you will not regret hav­
ing built this elemental. Because if there is no time for your wishes to be 
accomplished in this incarnation, they will be accomplished in the next 
or still next incarnation. So you must see that what you think most im­
portant for you to have, will not get in your way in a future incarnation. 
When you  study  desires, you  will  find that  when a desire is fulfilled, 
you desire something else and something else and something else. So a 
desire is not everything. 
There was a man who in an incarnation was dreaming and dreaming 
of publishing the Bible. It was very, very toilsome to write the Holy Bible 
on scrolls. This man was a painter, and his pupils were sitting for many, 
many hours, writing to preserve the New Testament. He was dreaming 
and 
dreaming about how to find a way to have the  Bible quickly writ­
ten  and  reproduced. It  was  not  Gutenberg who foresaw the printing 
machines. Maybe he found them ready in the psychical atmosphere of 
previous thinkers. 
After many, many centuries, this man became the slave of printing 
for 33 years of his life!  Have that in mind! 
What I tell you is this: Let reason prevail when you make your wishes 
and desires, because when these desires are accomplished, they might 
140 

be a waste of time and a stumbling stone in your way,  and more precious 
work cannot be done then. So it is better just to use reason. "Do we need 
that? Do we want that? And what will all that offer us?" 
This painter didn't regret, because with his thoughts he has helped 
the printing art in centuries to come. Therefore it was not in vain, it 
served a  purpose. 
When you wish to have something quickly,  give it time to work. 
Confine yourself to your room, close your eyes and accurately build an 
elemental of what you want. And circumstances will come in such a way 
(the elemental will arrange them) that your wish will be accomplished 
as soon as possible. 
When I was young, I knew a man who was very,  very poor. He dreamt 
of being able to find a room of his own to live in .  He came from a village, 
and he was living in a  small room with another three fellows, paying lit­
tle rent. He was with me; both of us were about 18 years old. He wanled 
to find a  job, and I taught him the art of visualization. He found a job. 
Now he wanted to have a  better one. He visualized a  better job, and he 
found one.-Then he wanted to have a  small house with a  little garden. 
Opportunities came, and one day after two or three years, he said: "Can 
I invite you to my house, Sir, to have a  coffee?" It was as he dreamt it. 
Opportunities arose, and he �arned the money.  He told me: "Everything 
came miraculously". Then he said: "Why not have a  bigger house and 
get married to a very beautiful woman, who even has some money?" He 
was dreaming of being in the church with a  rich, beautiful girl, and so 
it  came about. He has built a  bigger house. Now he is the proprietor of 
some multistory buildings in Limassol. 
• 
The other day he invited me, and I met him and his beautiful wife, 
an aged lady.  He has three or four sons, whom he deprives even of•nec­
essary things, telling them: "No, you don't need that". He is piling up 
the money he makes  from  renting his buildings in Limassol. When I saw 
him, I said:  "When did you enjoy anything? When did you take your wife 
and children on holiday and live your life?" "Oh, we don't have time for 
that. Business ... " 
. 
At the moment, he is thinking about becoming a  ship owner. He 
asked me: "What do you say?" I told him: "You are more stupid than at 
the time you were 18. What do you think all these things will give you?" 
"What do you suggest?" "Give a  sum of money to your sons, so that they 
can live in a  better way. You are not going to carry anything with you 
to the  other side. How many  years do you think you are going to live? 
Words of Truth I Chapter 15 
141 

Thousand years?" "You said we are continuing to  live .... "  "Yes,  but not 
here. And where will you be  living on the other side, you will not be able 
to  carry anything from here, unless ... "  "Unless?" "Unless you cash it 
in  a bank where you can get it  on the other side." "Which bank?" "The 
bank of love and kindness! You have so  much money. Don't chase poor 
people out of  your flats if  they cannot pay the rent! Don't take them 
to  court." "But. ...... "  "I don't want your 'but' and 'but'. Just don't do it! 
There are so  many starving people,  invalids and orphans. We have the 
refugee problem. And you are all the time piling up money!" "Look here, 
you are my friend, but you .are becoming my enemy now." "Why?" "You 
want me to get rid of my property!" "Okay, don't get rid of  it. But sooner 
or later your sons will make better use of it ,  after you have passed over." 
"I brought you here  just to  give me some pleasure." "What am I giving 
you? The truth. And what's the truth? Burning fire!" 
Have that in mind. Real truth is burning fire. I am sure that this man 
will not greet me if he sees me on the street, because I am giving him 
"bad" advice to get rid of precious  property and money. 
Build your elementals reasonably.  Get the art of  visualization, and 
you become rich, because getting the art of visualization is your richness. 
And what did Christ say? "Do not store up for yourselves treasures 
on earth (He meant material things), where moth and rust destroy,  and 
where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in ' 
heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy,  and where thieves do not 
break in  and steal. For where your treasure is ,  there your heart will be 
also.
" 
He said that the kingdom of  the heavens (of all the heavens) is 
within us. 
So what is our real property? The Mind and the amount of the Mind 
we can use! And if  we can use it in  the proper way, and not stupidly. 
If we use the holy Supersubstance of the Mind in the proper way, 
we will be given more. If we don't use it in the proper way, even what we 
have will be taken away from us. Christ said that in  a parable. 
We should deserve having, asking for more, and we will be given 
muc:h more than what we were asking for. As it  says in  the Bible: "Or 
what man is there among you w
h
o,   if his son asks for bread, will give him 
a stone? Or if  he  asks for a  fish, will he give him a  serpent?" 
So I suggest again that your best friend should be the New Testa­
ment. There you will find all the wisdom and all  the information. Don't 
run  to Hindu books. We have the real treasure in  our hands. 
142 

I don't underestimate  the  Eastern wisdom, but I don't like  "xeno­
mania", preferring something strange and  foreign. The  flowers in  my 
own garden have the  same quality as the  flowers in  the  garden of my 
neighbours. And  maybe mine are  of  better colour and  quality! I don't 
underestimate the  flowers in  the  gardens of  my  neighbours.  But why 
should I underestimate the flowers in my yard? 
Some people in my  circles like this  "xenomania", even here in Cy­
prus. I told them that anyone who is a researcher of the truth is allowed 
to try and find the truth anywhere he thinks he can find it. We are free. 
The first gift of God to man was freedom, and we are not allowed to de­
prive anyone of that freedom. Everyone must have his or her freedom. 
Bees from our beehive can bring honey to our hive from any garden 
all around us, if they like to fly to a distance and come back. So you .:an 
read everything, but use reason. And I tell you:  The enly one who said 
the truth and IS the truth is Christ!

CHAPTER 16 
Life, Personality, Bodies, Individuality, Elementals, 
Self-Analysis,  Self-Realization 
If  we  look around today we  will  see  that nearly all  people are  facing 
many problems. 
Sometimes education doesn't help too much in shaping the life in a 
satisfactory way. We  see  well-educated people and  uneducated people 
facing difficulties in life. 
I will try  in this lesson to help everybody to face their own problems. 
First you must see  what is life in a material body. Everlasting Life, 
Absolute Infinite Beingness, God, is something else and it needs much 
thought, meditation, concentration and  raising the  Self-consciousness 
to very, very high levels to understand it.  Of course, that is not for every­
body. But what is life in a human form, in a human being? This should 
be known by  everybody, so that they will be  able to face their problems 
satisfactorily. What is life in a material body? 
In the vegetable kingdom, the  plants are growing, flowering, giving 
fruit, there is life in a material form. We have also life in a material body 
in the animal kingdom and  that life is  not  very, very different from the 
life  of the  material body of  a  human being. Bones, flesh, blood, many 
organs have to function and work so that this system of life in a material 
body will continue existing and living. 
We can study all  kinds of  life in material bodies, but what is most 
necessary is  to study life in  a human body. This is, I think, the  duty of 
everybody. 
In schools all  over the  world, many things are  taught, but most of 
them are unnecessary. Things that those who study can find in libraries, 
if 
they are interested. And many things that everyone should know are 
not taught in schools or in the families. 
I  think it  is  the  duty of  the  family and the  school to  teach chil­
dren serious lessons: What is life? What can one expect from life? How 
144 

should we value life? What is a human being as a personality, separate 
from the personalities of others? 
The material bodies of people, men or women, are to some extent 
similar in substance and in matter. But the personalities of all the peo­
ple are very different, the one from the other. Why? Is the personality of 
a man the product of the material composition of his body?  Definitely, 
the personality of a man is not the product of his material body and the 
constitution of the material body, although this seemed to have been the 
idea some years ago. 
We can see people who are very healthy yet stupid. We can see very 
healthy people who are scientists. We can see very weak people, some­
times very ill due to certain reasons, who are geniuses. We can also see 
weak, ill people who are stupid. 
So,  the  condition of the  material body  is not responsible for the 
personality living in it. 
The seeker of the truth will have to study  the life of the material 
body.  He must know the conditions leading to a healthy material body. 
The first thing we will understand is that we are NOT the material body. 
Though the material body  is ours, the person is not that material body. 
One branch of our study is the life of the material body. How the mate­
rial body is kept in good heal.th. 
Another branch is to study the personality. Studying the personality, 
we study the condition of our so-called psychical body, because our per­
sonality is the product of the so-called elementals composing it, which 
are psychonoetical creatures. Creatures? Yes, things whic
.
h are created 
by 
us. The word creature means something that has been created. 
So, we should face boldly and with courage the present-day condi­
tion of our personality, because only  in this way  can we study  and•face 
our problems, which lead the personality of a man or a woman to great 
confusion today; and many times even leading people to commit suicide. 
Why? Life is precious! We have to understand how to value life. But 
how can we do it unless we know what life is in a material body, in a 
human body. 
We said that one branch of our study concerns the material body. 
The material body is kept alive and active by forces and energy which we 
call etheric energy. We will find our etheric double which is the mould 
and. the means through which  the material body  is kept alive and in 
good order. By observation, right thinking and reasoning, we can find the 
truth that a healthy material body is in need of the etheric double which 
Words of Truth I    Chapter 16 
145 

is the source of energy and power. Without it, the material body is dead. 
If the etheric double is taken out of the material body, the material body 
starts decaying; it destroys itself. 
So 
we have to study the functioning of the etheric double in and 
around 
the material body. We have to master this etheric double and use 
it, 
because otherwise how can we be sure that it exists? We are using 
our hands and we know that they exist because we use them. Unless we 
use our etheric double we cannot be sure that it really exists. And it does 
exist. Anyone can master it and use it. We call the etheric double etheric 
vitality. It has in itself all the essence of life. It is living! And because our 
etheric double is living, the material body is living. 
Now, studying our present-day-personality, we study its behaviour, 
the way it is expressing itself as emotions, desires, weaknesses and the 
many other ways the personality is expressing itself in life. By doing so, 
we find that besides the material body (with its etheric double), we also 
have  another body,  called  the  psychical body  (body of  emotions).  By 
studying, observing and using this psychical body, we will find that it too 
has its etheric double, which gives it strength and energy. 
Studying the condition of our psychical body and its etheric double 
is a most serious study. We can study the condition and the nature of the 
subconsciousness of a human being. 
Many psychologists are using this word "subconsciousness'', without 
knowing much about it. We don't only have to know what this subcon­
sciousness is, but we have to work in it, to keep it in a good and healthy 
condition, which means, cleaning our personality of many vices. In this 
way we find out that the so-called psychical body with its etheric double 
exists. But how can we find it out? By discovering our third body, which 
is the noetical body (the body of thought). 
We have three bodies with three etheric doubles. The material body, 
which we have to keep in good order. We have to study the function­
ing of its etheric double. We have the psychical body with its etheric 
double, the main body of our personality, on and in which we have to 
work, by mastering our desires, emotions and know the condition of our 
expressions. Then, we have to know about the existence of the noetical 
body. How? First by freeing it from  slavery! 
90% of the people, educated, civilized or not, all over the world, are 
enslaving the Mind to serve their desires, emotions and weaknesses. 
This  is the reason of the confusion in which  human beings find 
themselves. 
146 

The seekers of the truth have to separate the emotion from logic, 
reason and right thought, so that it will strengthen both, the psychical 
and the noetical bodies. But because emotion and thought are so much 
mixed up, some esoteric  teachings call the psychical and the noetical 
bodies psychonoetical body.  We prefer to  call them  by  their  separate 
names, know  them separately, work  separately with them and  master 
them. 
Most of us are Christians. Are these great truths mentioned in our 
religion, in the Gospel? Yes. Saint Paul who was a very,  very  advanced 
mystic not only  knew them and mentioned them.  He also used them. 
He spoke about the material body and the psychical body  and he  called 
what we know as noetical body the spiritual body. But we do not use the 
word spirit in this connection, because God is Spirit and also our re.ii 
Self is Spirit. We prefer the word noetical body, and·later, the same bod: 
in higher levels of consciousness, the noetic body. So, the noetical and 
the noetic body  are one - as lower and higher. We study them and u�c 
them. 
This is all well, but are all these bodies related to life? Is life as  we 
live it, our life in a human body, the outcome of these bodies? 
Are we these bodies or are these bodies ours which we have to mas­
ter and use. Definitely we are not these bodies. These bodies are having 
a form in which we have to live and express ourselves as living beings. 
"Being", a serious word. We call God Beingness. What is the differ­
ence now between the existence and beingness? What is the difference 
between a being and a living person? Great! 
• 
Our bodies are by  their functioning (creating elementals) compos­
ing our present-day-personality, but that is not our real Self. That is not 
Life. We make the mistake of thinking that these living elementals are 
ourselves. We are different from this personality; we are an individuality. 
The personaiities of all human beings, though similar in form and 
substance, are different in their quality. But what about the individual­
ity. The individuality is the Soul.  So, this is what we have to find  out 
- what we are. This kind of personality, changing all the time with the 
composition of the three bodies, is mortal. We are something different 
as a Soul individuality, a real being; we are immortal, everlasting. 
What is the difference between our personality, as a man or a wom­
an, with our feelings, and our Soul-Spirit-Self, our real Self? We have to 
find  out, and assimilate our personality to that Self-consciousness. We 
are not going to lose our personality. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 16 
147 

"And the mortal will be dressed in immortality, and the perishable 
will enter the imperishable." _ 
This is also mentioned in the  Bible.  It is the most misunderstood 
passage, even  by  the  high  clergy. If  you  ask  them  what  did  the most 
beloved God-man say,  they will not be able to explain. However, we can 
find out the truth about it. 
Now  I have given a sketch of a human being as a personality,  the 
bodies, the  composition of  this  kind  of  personality,  the  sum  total  of 
the bodies and the impressions received through the bodies. We talked 
about the noetical and noetic body. We have separated these things from 
the real Life Self. 
We make the mistake of calling our personality our self. This person­
ality self is changing day by day, month by month, year by year. In which 
way is it changing? In its expressions, in its interests, in the quality of 
the emotions and the desires, and also thoughts are changing, but WE are 
not changing. We are Life - we are living. And in the course of time by 
what we call concentration, meditation, observation and introspection, 
we will raise our self-consciousness to higher degrees and levels and we 
will find the truth, which is to assimilate our personality, our time and 
place-space personality, with our real nature, which is the Soul-Spirit. 
We assimilate it by what we call attunement. This needs much ef­
fort, study and sincerity with ourselves. And then we reach a point where 
we find that the range of our perception is greater now. As a personality 
we  could only  get  impressions in  the  material,  the  psychical and  the 
noetical plane from a short distance and mostly in  an  illusionary way. 
But now we know that behind the illusions is the reality, which we can 
find, piercing through the illusions. Then by this kind of study, we reach 
the state we call Self-Realization. 
Another great problem is to define and personally know what is the 
Self.  If someone asks you, "What are you? What is your Self?" You will 
make the  mistake of  saying that  your  self  is  a  man  or  a  woman, the 
present state of your consciousness I mean your interests, your way of 
thinking and your way of behaving. No! That is the shadow of your Self. 
That is not your Self, because it is changing all the time.  We are living 
in a world of continuous change, while our Self is never changing. 
As Soul-Spirit-Selves we were, we always are, and we will always be. 
The Spirit-Soul-Self is immortal - everlasting! 
You may say, "yes, but why don't I know that?" You are able to know 
that, if you look a little bit within. As a personality-self we give our at-
148 

tention only to the things outside. Introspection: what is looking within? 
Looking into our self,  into our real Self. Then we can look outside and 
understand what place, space, environment, locality and all the circum­
stances around us  mean. This  is  what life  is  giving us  in the outside 
world, though it  is not really very satisfactory.  Because, outside things 
can give a temporary satisfaction but not happiness. 
By looking within, we can study things. By saying this,  I don't mean 
that we should stop living and trying to understand things from outside 
by  using reason and  the  new powers we have  gained. Looking within 
means to search and find our real Self. 
We call the material plane the first kingdom of the heavens. But that 
is not all.  What did the beloved God-man Joshua say? - "The  kingdom 
of the heavens is within you" (Seven can be traced). Can we find these 
heavens? Can we live in these heavens? 
Sooner or later we  have to return back home to  our real  nature as 
Spirit-Souls. We are not going to remain always in a material form. 
In a forl!I yes, in a psychical and a noetical form, the same as the mater­
ial form - yes, but not in gross matter. We have to find first the kingdom 
of the heavens within us. In us, and not in our bodies. In our real nature, 
as Spirit-Souls. What is it? Life itself. And we said that Life is God. And 
what did Christ say about it? "Ye are Gods and Sons of the Almighty. All 
of you." All of you even as human beings. Of course these things need 
study and analysis. 
Studying and believing blindly means nothing. Studying it, knowing 
it and living it; to live with this truth. How? How cal\ we do  that? We 
can investigate it in introspection. When God had decided to give the 
human form to human beings, with the cooperation of the holy Archang­
els,  the Lords of the elements, he said, "Let us make man acco'rding to 
our likeness and .in our image". Was he speaking? No, ·He was vibrating 
His desire and His pleasure which the holy Archangels have received by 
attunement and they started to cooperate, creating the bodies of human 
beings. 
Creating a human being, a body of  a human being, of  a man  or  a 
woman -starting from the spermatozoon and then through the natural 
way,  God decided that a body (and the other two bodies) be  created in 
the belly of a woman, to be born as a child. A great mystery. 
A mother gives birth. The baby finds itself in a material world breath­
ing, crying and in need of taking food. A boy or a girl comes to life. Does 
the mother know anything about the body of that child? How  does the 
Words of Truth I Chapter 16 
149 

brain in the skull function? The child is breathing, what is the action we 
call breathing. 
By observation anyone can see this great truth and if we think prop­
erly we should glorify the Creator or Creators. All these things are pass­
ing without being consciously noticed. 
We see the child growing without caring where it  came from. Is  it 
possible to know that? Of course it is  possible to know - by introspec­
tion. We find ourselves here now. Why? We are living in our material 
body.  Why? By observation we will see an endless chain of "whys" which 
need an answer.  Is there an· answer to this? Of course there is. How? 
When God created us He gave us legs to walk, hands to  work with. 
He gave us a  mind to  use and work with. Do we use it? Do we use our 
mind? Are we reasoning? Are we using our mind in  observation, pay­
ing attention and trying to  know and understand what is  happening all 
around us in  the world? What is  our real role in  this world? What is 
the purpose of our life? What is life? Life in a human body, in a  human 
form? 
I am telling you that the most important thing to be learnt is  rarely 
taught in  the  family or  at  school. The seekers of the truth are trying to 
teach the truth of  our reality.  What are we in  reality? What is  life? We 
have been told to  believe in  a  God. What do  we mean by God, what by 
believing in  God,  and which God? Is  God in  need of  our believing in 
Him? Of course not. 
I heard some scientist say that all these Gods definitely have been 
created by the human beings who were in need of deceiving themselves. 
Of course, we agree that all through the ages people by  fear and by  ne­
cessity have created Gods. Did these Gods exist and are they still exist­
ing? Yes, they existed and they are existing  now.  It  does not matter that 
they did not know anything about what we call elementals. 
In  the Bible Christ is  mentioning these elementals. Everything con­
cerning the truth you will find in the New Testament. 
Elementals are made of  Mind and they have a  form, a  shape. They 
can be strengthened if  held by many people, they can even be made to 
serve those who believe in  them, yes definitely.  Call them false gods if 
you like, but they have served  those who believed in  them.  With  the 
advancement of  the human  race  some of  these  gods have been aban­
doned. 
If  an atheist tells me that all the ancient gods had been created 
by man, I will agree with him, but I will add the question, "And who 
150 

created man?" - "You deny the Super-Intelligence which created you. 
Do you simply call it  circumstances? Do   you call it  matter? You are a 
materialist, you give matter divine qualities. What  is  wrong with sepa­
rating the divine qualities of  Super-Intelligence from matter? Because 
matter can be used and mastered. What about Super-Intelligence? Who 
created and put your brains in  your skull and who is causing your heart 
to beat? If you do not want to call Him God, call It  Eternal Life. Call it 
Life. What is  Life?  Study the phenomena of life and you will understand 
what Life is,  what God is." 
God gave us a material body to live in. That material body is  in per­
fect condition, unless we interfere by a nonsensical way of life. disturb­
ing its  proper functioning, disturbing what is  called good health. :\nd 
the holy Archangels of the elements, cooperating, are working unccw, 
ingly to keep our material body in good order. We do not have to care t•;<' 
much about our material body,  except to  feed it properly and clean it. 
We have been given, as  I  said, psychical substance to compose J 
psychic�! body,  which is exactly the same in  form as  the material hody. 
We have to work with it, because its quality is the quality of our pre�ent­
day-personality. 
Mainly,  we  have to  work on  our psychical body. Before even know­
ing it,  before using it,  we  can clean it,  independently of  the material 
body.  How? By trying to understand the nature of our emotions and our 
desires, how they are created and how we  have to  face them, and  how 
not to make our personality their slave; how not to become slaves of our 
own elementals. 
. 
We have to study the nature of these elementals, not visible but most 
powerful. Most p�ople cannot see them, except clairvoyants or  seers. 
But even without seeing them, everybody is  under their influen'ce, they 
are torturing them, they are torturing all  those who are careless and do 
not know how to protect themselves. We have to study our desires, our 
emotions, study how they come to life and how elementals are created. 
Now these elementals compose our present-day-personality. God, the 
most merciful, gave us  the Mind to  use as  reason. There is no excuse 
for a human being not to use his  Mind! By using our Mind we realise in 
time, what we are, as a real personality-individuality. Having a name yet 
feeling that we are a  Soul. This is the first step we  should take. 
As you start to use the Mind you are getting more power. Your hands 
will never get strong, and you cannot acquire any kind of  skill unless 
you use your  hands and practise.  Likewise with the Mind. The Mind is 
Words of Truth I Chapter l 6 
151 

not the human brain. The  human brains are like  a  battery,  but  unless 
there is electricity,  the battery is nothing. So, the material brains are to 
be used by the personality using the Mind through them to express itself 
emotionally and dynamically. 
We have to  study these ways of living. What  will  we  find  out? In 
developing our  psychical body,  we  can transfer our  self-consciousness 
from the material body to the psychical body.  I  said before that in form, 
the psychical and noetical bodies are the same as the material body, be­
cause the material body is the result of those bodies. So, in the psychical 
head, are there brains as we have them in the material head? No. The 
whole psychical body is the source of thought. Are there in the psychi­
cal body organs of sight, hearing, touching as we have the five senses in 
the material body? No. Every particle in the psychical body is an eye, an 
ear, and a brain. But you have to train yourself to use it, and by learning 
how to use it,  in the course of  time, you will gain what we call  Super­
consciousness. We  can  have this  kind of  Superconsciousness even by 
training the etheric double of the material body. 
The material body is the weakest of the bodies we  are  using. Our 
consciousness is living more comfortably in a trained and good psychical 
body.  We cannot have a trained and good psychical body unless we  are 
the masters of our  emotions, thoughts and  desires, which are in  most 
people torturing them. 
It  needs much study,  introspection and  the  will  to  master desires 
and  emotions. I said  that the  first  step  and  the  most serious is  to free 
our  mind, by  reason and thought, from being slave of  the  desires and 
emotions. 
This is  what I  call  real  life  in  the  material world, as  a  sane and 
reasonable personality. Studying the  conditions of  life  all  around you, 
what really is  the reason for so  many problems people are facing today, 
bringing them to  despair and  confusion? I  said, by  observation, study 
and  meditation we  can  find  out  the  reason: Uncontrolled desires and 
emotions, leading to  dissatisfaction. We  have to  study the  nature of 
these  desires and  emotions, using reason. Observe how  these desires 
and emotions are created and how we can think about them and control 
them before they begin to subjugate our personality,  forcing us to make 
the Mind slave of these emotions and desires. 
This is what is happening every day to  everybody,  -  people live  in 
slavery to  desires and  emotions  without being able  to  control them or 
master them. That leads to confusion and despair. This is the main prob-
152 

lem creating so many other problems around us.  How can we cope with 
this problem? By right thinking. 
You will have to bring the problem to mind. Start analyzing it, ques­
tion it (with many "whys"), and in the course of time you will de-energize 
these elementals (we know that all emotions and desires are elementals) 
and become masters of the situation. There is no other way. 
By surrendering to the elementals, to our desires and emotions, we are 
enslaving ourselves to the elementals and create within us confusion and 
dissatisfaction. So what we need is what I call self-analysis. By self now I 
mean the present-day-personality, because it is a kind of self, it is the shad­
ow of our real Spirit-Soul-Self, though changing every moment. It is that 
part of ourselves we have to clean, because it is that part of our so-called 
self,  which is in confusion. Our Spirit-Soul-Self is never in confusion 
The difficulty is in attuning our present-day-personality to our real 
Self,  individuality.  The  personality is  the  time  and  place-space exist­
ence of our expressions, but our real Self is the individuality which is 
the  Soul. So  the  effort should start  with  the  present-day-personality, 
because-it is the one to be benefited. First by knowing and understand­
ing our personality-self and th�n by feeling the desire to assimilate itself 
with the higher Self. 
One can never free oneself from any desires or weaknesses follow­
ing the desires or emotions unless one knows the nature of these desires 
and emotions and the ways they can give one satisfaction. This is what 
I  call  right  thinking in  the  given circumstances and  conditions. This 
kind of  meditation is useful and ver
y 
different from �II other kinds of 
meditation (offered in the East) which lead nowhere. I call it introspec­
tion, looking withi�, or self-analysis. It should be the aim of every psy­
chologist to know the way how to free a patient from the burden of the 
torturing elementals. These elementals, Mind-emotional-forms, can be 
de-energized by �eason. Then we shall be free from them. 
I do not mean that we should give up all kinds of emotions. There are 
also noble emotions. We are here on this planet to master emotions and 
not to banish them completely from our life. We are here on this planet 
to enjoy even matter. Why do you think the Absolute Beingness gave us 
a material body and why are the holy Archangels of the elements all the 
time  working in these material bodies  keeping them in  good  order so 
that we can live in them - unless there is a very high purpose behind .it. 
If you suffer from a deep wound that has been inAicted on your leg, 
a doctor may put some stitches to help the wot.ind healing, he may also 
Words of Truth I Chapter 16 
153 

give you some medicine. But who is really healing the wound? The doc­
tor and the medicine are helping to some extent, but the real recovery is 
by Life itself, by God. The holy Archangels of the elements are working 
in the material body and healing the wound. To the holy Archangels it 
means that your material body is most precious. Why is it not precious 
to you? Value it.  In this way you value life. Thank the Archangels for 
keeping your material body in good order. These are the first steps you 
have to take in valuing life. The God-man Joshua said that our material 
bodies are the temple of God. 
Even as present-day-personalities with all our vices, weaknesses and 
stupidities, we are the Sons of the Almighty, tolerated to live in a mater­
ial body, in which the Archangels are working every moment to keep the 
body in good order. 
Thank those who are working to keep all your bodies in good health; 
and help them do it. 
A stupid way of life causes illnesses. All illnesses are the outcome of 
our transgressions and contraventions against the laws of Nature. 
We have to study all that, value life and live in a proper way. 
Meditation. 
First of all, relax completely in your material body. Start at the feet, 
relax completely the feet, the legs, the thighs, the belly, the Solar Plexus. 
Breathe deeply and comfortably.  Relax completely the hands, the arms. 
You are in that body of yours. What do we mean by "you," by "my­
self?" You are that feeling entity in the body. But at this moment the holy 
Archangels of the elements are working in your body.  In every human 
being the holy Archangels are working. A Michael, one of the billions of 
that order of Michaels, Lord of fire, heat and light is working. A Gabriel 
is working, Lord of the liquids. A Raphael, is working, one of the billions 
of that order. A  Uriel, a balancer, the Archangel who is balancing the 
forces is working. 
They cooperate most wisely creating in your bodies all the circum­
stances to keep that body in good order and living. They care about the 
life of your material body although it is not your life in reality.  But you 
are living in the body. Your real Life is quite different from the life of the 
material body. 
Later when you will cooperate with them you can become master of 
your material body, because in reality you are an Archangel, one of them. 
Now in your material body a Michael, a Gabriel, a Raphael are co­
operating, working creatively.  You have now a material body. You feel it. 
154 

You are in it. Thank them mentally, just in your mind, give them thanks. 
They do so much for you. They create the blood, the circulation of the 
blood, your breathing. The Raphaels get the etheric vitality for you. They 
work in your digestive system. They keep the brains in good order. They 
keep the body functioning in a healthy,  satisfactory way; they cooperate 
by not wasting the etheric vitality which the Almighty is giving you every 
day. "Give us this day our daily bread." Whether we are asking or not, He 
is giving it to us.  It is Life. 
Breathe now deeply and  thank the  Absolute  Infinite Intelligence 
which is God, the Logos, the Holy Spirit and the holy Archangels work­
ing in your bodies - now in the material bodies. 
Feel that life is precious. Value life. 
The holy Archangels love you without asking anything from you. If 
you love yourself and your body they will be pleased. Value their creative 
work in your bodies. Value life.

CHAPTER 17 
Death of the Material Body, Permanent Atoms, 
Permanent Personality, Ontopeisis 
Today  we will talk about the phenomenon of the death of the material 
body. This is a fact. 
But what is this fact that has frightened millions of people through­
out the centuries? What is the death of the material body? We said that 
the  material body is  a  body that has a  beginning.  Consequently, what 
has  a  beginning must have an  end. From its beginning up to its  end it 
continuously undergoes changes. Saint Paul said: "Every day I die," and 
talking about death, he meant the continuous change. 
What kind of  changes does the  personality self-awareness of  man 
undergo, which thinks that it  is the material body? Firstly, the continu­
ous change of the molecules, atoms and cells in the material body, while 
the body is  growing up.  We  see that the body is growing up, it is main­
tained, it  lives and changes according to omniscient laws, divine laws. 
We  see that the material bodies of  all people throughout the  centuries 
- being under the  Total Wisdom and divine laws - complete a circle of 
existence, predetermined wisely within the  divine  plan, established to 
serve a certain purpose. 
The mistake of man throughout the centuries up until today is that 
he is not concerned to know the purpose of the circle of existence of his 
material body. This explains the fear of death. I will give you an example: 
If  we  look at  a small seed of a eucalyptus tree, this small seed contains 
the whole circle of life of this tree. Now suppose we cut the eucalyptus 
tree in many, many small pieces. If  I  take a very small piece of that tree 
of the same size as the seed and give it to a scientist, he will not be able 
to find anything different from what he  found in the  seed. But if I bury 
the pieces of the tree in the earth, they will be dissolved, because they 
contain neither the possibilities nor the probabilities of the divine Will­
pleasure which is  contained in  the  small seed. When man descends 
156 

for the first time as a ray of a holy Monad under the Total Wisdom, To­
tal Power and Total Love, he  creates three so-called permanent atoms. 
Each one of them -even though they are tiny- contains everything that 
concerns the life of the human being and everything that was imprinted 
as subconsciousness, memory and experience. 
Three permanent atoms: 
The first is made of Supersubstance of the lower noetical body, and 
of course it is in the fifth dimension. The second is made of substance 
of the psychical body and the psychical world, and of course, it contains 
all the possibilities of the fourth dimension. The third permanent atom 
is made of material substance. It is a material atom made of (ethereal) 
substance, yet it is eternal, indestructible. The three permanent atoms 
together are giving us the so-called permanent personality, which is eter­
nal, immortal. 
Don't think that man creates new permanent atoms in every incar­
nation. In his first descent thousands of centuries ago, he had created 
the permanent atom, made of material substance. The permanent atom 
remains the same in each incarnation. It is a new page in the big book of 
man's life. And his experiences are the wisdom of this book.  In every 
incarnation, a new material body is built around the material permanent 
atom. In the same way, a new psychical body is built around the psychical 
permanent atom. And a new noetical body is built around the noetical 
permanent atom. 
So the bodies change, degenerate and are discarded and dissolved, 
and new ones are prepared around every particle of the p�rll'anent atom. 
But pay attention to what I will say now: 
Anything that �ill be built around the permanent atom is the prod­
uct of what has been recorded in the past. And those who build the new 
bodies from Supersubstance based upon what has been Tecorded in the 
past around the permanent atoms, are the Holy Spirit and the Archang­
els of the four elements fire, water,  ether and earth. So your self is not 
the elements. The elements are the substance, the material from which 
our bodies are built. I can say  our bodies are our temple, the temple of 
God. Now, what is our connection with these permanent atoms? What 
is  our relation with  them  as  self-awareness,  as  Superconscious, con­
scious and subconscious self�awareness? In time, these permanent at­
oms as a complete, perfect permanent personality will reach the level of. 
our Self as Soul-Self awareness, and will give to the Soul-Self-awareness 
"ontopeisis." [This word cannot he translated. In Greek "on" means "being" 
Words of Truth I Chapter 17 
157 

and  "peisis" derives from the word "to become." Ontopeisis is closely linked 
with Theosis. Theosis is seen from the point of view of the  human being, 
his  illumination and  union with the  Spirit-Ego, while ontopeisis is  seen 
from the point of view of the Spirit-Ego -what it has gained by its projec­
tion through the Idea of Man and its life on earth until Theosis. When we 
"come home" through Theosis, we have a  ''fuller" being than our brethren, 
the Archangels, who only know the good.] 
0NTOPEISIS is  the purpose. So  the purpose is  not found in  one 
incarnation only. Just as  the purpose of  education and learning is  not 
achieved by  attending kindergarten, elementary school, high school or 
university for  one day. If you study only one day's lessons, you will not 
understand the purpose of education. 
Now, as researchers of truth, we know that the purpose is "ontopei­
sis" of our holy monadic self within the Absolute Beingness. And this is 
the divine Mercy. Because the Absolute Beingness, the Heavenly Father 
wants His children to be as perfect as  He is.  It is not possible for a holy 
Monad to be  as perfect, if it is  not the master of all the ideas and all the 
knowledge in  the universes, and of the expressions of the divine within 
the universes through the Mind. Finally, the work a well-prepared holy 
Monad undergoes within the Absolute Beingness is to assist the divine 
plan and to serve in return. 
Since the permanent personality's self-awareness has lived many 
centuries in material bodies and has become the master of gross matter, 
psychical matter substance and noetical substance and Supersubstance 
- it  will no longer be "master" - just an  expression of wisdom within its 
bodies (with its forms, concepts, noetical images and thoughts) - but it 
will possibly be  a  Logos, a  planetary Logos and even more. Remember 
the parable of  the talents. The man who had been given the five bags 
of gold returned and said: "Lord, you delivered to  me five bags. Look, 
I have gained five more besides them." "Well done good and faithful 
servant", his  lord said to him. "You were faithful over a few things, I will 
make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord." 
How many Christians understand the meaning of this parable? Now 
what is happening when death of the material body occurs? 
A tired material body is  discarded. It  is  useless and can no  longer 
serve the permanent personality. The permanent atom withdraws imme­
diately to  the noetic world, since it  has already recorded all it knows and 
all  the experiences of  the psychical atom and the noetical atom. What 
is recorded on  the psychical atom? Events, details? Not necessarily. The 
158 

psychical atom records the emotional vibrations these events create. It 
is what we call psychical conditions. 
A fuller recording of the events is made on the noetical atom, be­
cause it is based on the thoughts of the lower noetical body. The full­
est 
recording of the life of man is done on the permanent atom of the 
noetical body.  Consequently, the permanent atom of the material body 
(which had worked together with  the  other  permanent atoms) is not 
needed any longer, since it has nothing to offer.  So it withdraws to the 
noetic world. 
The seat of the material permanent atom is in the heart,  from the 
moment an infant takes his first breath. The inhaling and exhaling is the 
work of the material permanent atom. The pulse of the heart is the work 
of the material permanent  atom. The building up of each atom and cell 
within the material body is prompted by this powerful material perma­
nent atom, which is the point from where the silver cord starts.  Some 
mystics in the past called this silver cord "the belt". 
When the  material permanent atom  leaves the material body,  the 
material body dissolves. 
When man's self-awareness withdraws in exosomatosis to go to the 
psychical or noetical world, the material body continues to live in a kind 
of sleep state.  It  does  not die,  because the material permanent atom 
remains in the material heart. There is its work, purely on the gross mat­
ter. 
The metabolism and the functioning of the material body is the work 
of the material permanent atom. The material permane11t atom appears 
to be perishable, yet it is indestructible. As long as man is living in his 
material body, work is continuously taking place around the permanent 
atom. This is giving us the phenomenon of life. When you meditate on 
the material permanent atom, you will see how it is working in absolute 
Total Wisdom. · 
Pay attention now: A material permanent atom is telepathically con­
nected with the Holy Spirit. All the material permanent atoms of all men 
who have ever lived, who live now and who will live in the future are the 
material cells within the ,,organism" of the Holy Spirit. 
Now,  what is our connection with the permanent atoms, our con­
nection as divine projections, as life self-awareness? It  is the record­
ing of everything that we experience. But the recording is not done on 
foreign matter or substance, but on our own. We trace our experiences 
without ever erasing matter or substance from our own self. 
Words of T rvth I Chapter 17 
159 

Is the material permanent atom built up of gross matter or is it built 
up of etherial substance through the etheric counterpart of the material 
body? We said in other lessons that the etheric double of the gross mat­
erial body is material in invisible condition, yet it is matter. This material 
permanent atom is built up from the creative, imprinting, aesthetic and 
kinetic ethers. Consequently its  nature is  etherial. Any material atom 
within the material body lives from its etheric counterpart. All creative 
work takes  place from the center of this etheric counterpart outwards. 
We have the movement within the body and the omniscient imprint­
ing of events like birth, m�vement of the cells and atoms. All this is done 
in perfect order. 
I want you  to  meditate one day on your material permanent atom, 
because this is the total of your life in the material world. 
Around the  material permanent atom your present-day-personality 
is built up,  of  course with the  help of  the  psychical and  noetical per­
manent atoms.  The permanent atom is  eternal projection, while the 
present-day-personality self-awareness of  one  incarnation is  a creation 
around a name and a material, psychical and noetical body. 
160 

CHAPTER  18 
Permanent Atom, Present-day-Personality, Subconscious 
The subconscious of man is the total of the experiences imprinted, first 
on-the permanent atom and later on the present-day-personality's aware­
ness. So  the nucleus of the subconscious of a persotl 1s definitely the 
permanent atom which is like a microfilm and has all the experiences 
of all  former incarnations recorded in full  details. Of course, we  have 
to use an� develop this film to be  able  to  see  every detail in  our  sub­
conscious. The experiences are based on details, on the reactions, the 
impressions which are stored for good in the subconscious. When man 
incarnates,-the nucleus of his permanent atom has all the previous in­
carnations on its surface. Around the nucleus we have an aura, I could 
say, a  psychonoetical aura. The permanent atom is psychonoetical, ethe­
real and  material. On this aura exists the total of experiences, without 
the details, only predispositions, virtues and existing weaknesses. 
If you make introspection, you  do  not have to know ,the  details. In 
order to  know yourself and  benefit thereby, you can study the  "radia­
tion" of the permanent atom or the part we call present-day-personality 
on which are imprinted all the experiences you  have had. You wilf find 
out where and what you have to improve and what you  have to uproot. 
When the researcher of the truth enters his subconscious in deep intro­
spection or psychonoetical exercise he will be able to use this microfilm 
of the present-day-personality and of all previous incarnations in every 
detail. However, this is not really necessary because the wise researcher 
of the truth follows the advice of the Beloved One who said that he who 
puts his hand to the plough looks forward and not behind. Behind him 
the furrow is already open, no need to look behind, look forward. When 
the researcher grows spiritually and makes progress the Book of his life, 
i.e. ALL the pages of his incarnations will be open and easily seen, to be 
read and studied. This Book of his life is his subconsciousness. 
Words of Truth I Chapter I 8 
161 

We have said that the  total of elementals, i.e.  thought-desires and 
desire-thoughts, which today make up our  present-day-personality self, 
is what we call subconscious. This we  have to study. 
We call the subconscious the present-day-personality, but, in fact, 
they are two different aspects of the same. What do the subconscious 
and the present-day-personality have in common and what makes them 
different? The central point is  the present-day-personaiity, the way we 
think and feel, the  way we  record our  impressions, our  experiences, 
our interests, our ordeals, our pains, our sorrow and happiness, on the 
etheric double of the  material body, on the  etheric double of the psy­
chical body and on the etheric double of the noetical body. Now it  is 
also important how they are recorded, with which degree of intensity, 
with interest or with indifference. We now see the central point is the 
present-day-personality and I,  as  George or  Mary, with my  interests, 
remain the same in the subconscious. What are my  interests? 
Now I  have two points, the present-day-personality self, which I 
call vigilance, and the point which receives impressions. But how do 
I receive impressions and how do  I  react to  the  impressions? Now, 
the "How I react" is  the  part of  the subconscious. How does the 
present-day-personality self, as  George or  Mary, react to experiences, 
to impressions, to anything that comes to him or her through the five 
senses, through the so-called perception: with anger, displeasure, with 
joy? Why do  we  not  all  react the  same way to  events around us? If 
ten  people are  faced with the  same event, there will be  ten  differ­
ent  reactions to  it,  they may range from joy  to  displeasure and pain. 
This is an  important point. Why? We can  draw the  conclusion that it 
is  not the  outside world nor the five senses which are important, but 
rather the  way of  receiving the  impressions through the  five  senses 
and the reaction to them by  the present-day-personality self-awareness 
prompted by the memory or  recollection of recorded impressions and 
experiences. 
When we  study the  present-day-personality and the so-called sub­
conscious, shall we consider them to be one and the same? We  have to 
take the  meaning of  time into consideration. The subconscious draws 
memories and conditionings FROM THE  PAST and brings them to  the 
present. The present-day-personality self, on  the other hand, perceives, 
AT  THE  PRESENT TIME, phenomena of  life  and corresponding impres­
sions through the  five senses. 
162 

The researcher of the truth will study these two conditions and the 
relationship between them. Who is the researcher who will study these 
conditions? Is the researcher one of these two states or none of these 
two conditions? Could it be that these two conditions are one state with 
two extensions? Yes, this is it. 
The present-day-personality self is the sum total of his elementals, 
i.e. desire-thought forms and  thought-desire forms, all that has been 
imprinted on the permanent atom,  is what we generally call our self. 
Now, who are we as researchers of the truth? Of course, we are not the 
present-day-personality, nor are we that part of the present-day-person­
ality which is under the water - not on its surface - which we call the 
subconsciousness. 
What are we then? Our research will show us that we are not the 
present-day-personality self,  neither our  time-and-place experiences, 
nor the part of ourselves - even though it is beautiful when we study 
it - that we call Mind. We do have the capacity to use imprint ether lo 
produce pictures, idols, colour, worlds - yes, even whole worlds, and in 
these worlds a personality - again not our real  Self -is moving, is living, 
is enchanted in time and place. 
There is a difference between the time and place in the subcon­
sciousness and  the  tim�  and  place  in  the  worlds of  memory,  in  the 
psychical world. Now  we will connect the subconsciousness with the 
psychical world where we will find ourselves one day.  Think. We have 
talked about the psychical world, 7 planes, divided in 7 subplanes, 49 
all together. Now we face the question, is the subcons.cious the psychi­
cal world? Think about this, carefully. Our material body which is com­
posed of the elements of the three-dimensional material world, is it the 
material world? No, it is getting the substance from the material world 
and it is a part of the  material  world. In the same way,  the so-called 
subconscious of  the  present-day-personality is  getting psychonoetical 
substance from the psychonoetical world. What is the connection with 
the planes and subplanes of the psychonoetical world? Think about it. 
According to the purity,  cleanliness and perfection of the person con­
cerned, he or she will find himself or herself in the corresponding plane 
or subplane of the psychical world. No one will forcibly place him in the 
psychical world. He will find himself exactly in the place he merits. 
When we will leave our material body we will never find ourselyes 
in any paradise or hell we are not already in, because the state of our 
subconsciousness does not change by magic. 
Words of Truth I Chapter 18 
163 

We have said that the nucleus of the subconsciousness is the psy­
chonoetical and ethereal permanent atom and around it is the present­
day-personality.  The present-day-personality self is composed of the ma­
terial body and its etheric double, the psychical body and its counterpart 
and  the  noetical body and  its  double. The  total of  these three bodies 
compose the present-day-personality. Next, we have the composition of 
the subconsciousness. As surprising as it may sound, the Total Wisdom, 
Power and  Love exist in their entirety in the centre of the  galaxy, in  a 
sun, in a planet, and in exactly the same way the Total Wisdom, Power 
and Love exist in every atom of the material body. The subconsciousness 
exists in  its  entirety in  every material, ethereal, psychical and  noeti­
cal atom in their respective bodies and etheric counterparts. Complete 
records exist in every atom, myriads of records, nothing can be lost. Who 
records all this? We do. What about changes? Every change is faithfully 
registered in the subconsciousness, in every atom. 
Later we  can  see  the  connection of  the  kingdom of  heaven, which is 
within us,  with the subconsciousness. 
The  subconsciousness is leading us through three doors: one door 
takes us to hell, most horrifying, and one door to paradise, most beauti­
ful,  and one door leads to bliss. Decide and choose. 
164 

CHAPTER 19 
Creative, Imprinting, Aesthetic and Kinetic Ethers, Psychical and 
Noetical Bodies, Exosomatosis 
The etheric double of the material body is  the link between the mate­
rial body and the psychical body. This is  one of  its roles; it connects the 
psychical with the material. 
The Holy Spirit and Christ Logos use this connection to sustain and 
maintain the material body. They use part of the etheric double, namely 
the creative ether. 
The creative ether always remains in the material body and is  never 
detached. Yet it  is  influenced by the psychical and noetical bodies. 
In other lessons we talked about the so-called kinetic ether, aes­
thetic ether, and imprinting ether. 
So,  as long as man finds himself within his psychical and noetical 
bodies in his material body, the etheric double completely unites the 
psychonoetical body with the material body. But now the connection 
is  also complete between the kinetic ether of the eth�ric double of the 
material body and the kinetic ether of  the etheric double of the psychi­
cal and the noetical body. 
They are completely connected and work together. This is 
'
also the 
case between the aesthetic ether of the material body within the mate­
rial body, and the aesthetic ether of the etheric double of the psychical 
and noetical body. Man finds himself with his psychical and noetical 
body, within his mater\al body. This means he is fully alert. 
Now for the so-called IMPRINTING ETHER: 
The average person,  who does not have· at his disposal so-called 
intuition or telepathy or other higher abilities, is living only in his mate­
rial 
body. In this case there is  no connection between the imprinting 
ether of the etheric double of his psychical body and his noetical, and 
the imprinting ether of the etheric double of the material body and the 
psychical.

This is the reason why a person who subconsciously leaves his body 
while he is asleep, cannot bring back with him impressions or memo­
ries  of his experiences in  the  psychical worlds,  when he returns. It is 
because there is no connection or  cooperation between the imprinting 
ether of his material body and the imprinting ether of his psychical body 
and his noetical body.  So he must "bridge" this connection. 
Let us see what happens in exosomatosis. 
The  etheric double of  the  psychical body  is  found entirely in  the 
psychical body, none of it _can stay in the  material body - this is clear. 
But  which part  of the  etheric double of  the  material body  is  carried 
along, absorbed, if  I can say so, by the psychical body, and which part 
remains in the material body? 
The etheric double is not an independent body,  to be used by man, 
as a body to express itself as awareness or consciousness,  but it is the 
connecting link for a    specific purpose;  for the functioning of man, as a 
phenomenon of life. 
In  exosomatosis,  the  kinetic, aesthetic, imprinting, and  creative 
ethers of  the  psychical body, immediately accompany the  psychical 
body.  Now, a part of the kinetic, aesthetic and imprinting ethers of the 
material body follow the psychical body. The creative ether of the ma­
terial body remains completely within the material body, because if  it 
leaves, the material body will begin to decompose. 
The etheric double of  the  material body never leaves the material 
body, as a kind of a body, without causing the phenomenon we call death 
of the material body. 
I have  said  that,  part  of  the  aesthetic, kinetic and  imprinting 
ethers accompany the  psychical body, but  which part?  This  depends 
on the degree of perfection of the  researcher. If  the part that  follows 
is equal to  the  part  that  remains,  then  the  so-called imprinting ether 
bridges the  gap,  and  the  imprinting ether is  balanced. Consequently, 
assuming the  vibrations of the  imprinting ether as  a whole are I 00%, 
then 50% accompany the  psychical body  and  the  other 50% remain 
within the material body,  mainly in the material brain and the nervous 
system, and  generally in  the  whole nervous system,  and  even  in  the 
Solar Plexus and  the  ganglion system. Then the  memory will  be 
bridged. 
So
, 
the person, who will make exosomatosis, will know where he is, 
where he  is going, what he is doing, and when he returns he will com­
pletely 
imprint his experiences and impressions. 
)66 

How must the vibrations of the imprinting ether be in balance? This 
is the purpose of the exercises we do in our circles. 
AESTHETIC ETHER. It is not necessary for the aesthetic and kinetic 
ethers to accompany the imprinting ether, but it does not matter if a very 
small part does accompany them. 
If  a  part  of the  kinetic and  aesthetic ethers without the  imprint­
ing  ether accompanies the  psychical body, then we  have undesirable 
phenomena for  the  material body, like  nightmares, sleepwalking, bad 
health, and other for the material body unpleasant conditions. 
When the  creative ether remains completely within the  material 
body in the etheric double, between the material and psychical body, a 
mystic can control the creative ether, through the kinetic, aesthetic, and 
imprinting ethers, when he is living in his material body. When he is in 
exosomatosis, he can telepathically control it, thrOLtgh the small pa rt of 
the aesthetic and kinetic ethers, which accompany him. 
One day you  will know it  empirically,  when you have made a  con­
scious exosomatosis. 
Balance must be established in the so-called imprinting ether, rnmp­
lete balance. The imprinting ether is the seat of the memory, and I c<1n 
say,  the foundation of the present-day-personality self-awareness. 
In our circles, with the  exercises we make, we  investigate the parl 
we  call  subconscious. For  the  researcher of  the  truth must gradually 
become aware of the subconscious. 
When the  researcher makes an exosomatosis and drifts in  his  psy­
chical body, he directs the balanced part of the imprintii;ig ether into the 
imprinting ether of the etheric double of his psychical body, and in this 
way he can gover� his psychical body. 
If  someone cannot accomplish balance, then he cannot gov�rn his -
psychical body in the psychical worlds, and his psychical body will be 
like a kite,  which the psychonoetical currents, like a strong wind, take 
here and there. 
When the  imprinting ether of  the  etheric double of  the  material 
body and the imprinting ether of the psychical body are balanced, such 
a balance becomes a powerful  steering gear in the hands of the present­
day-personality,  which is under the guidance of the  Inner-Self; the per­
manent personality. Then through this the individual being, with its will­
power in full alertness, can go everywhere he wishes and get complete 
impressions from wherever he wishes and visit any plane or subplane of 
the psychical world.

The decision and capability rest with you, whether to  get  experi­
ences and keep the impressions after an exosomatosis. 
Now,  in the psychical worlds, balance must be established between 
the  imprinting ether of  the  psychical world and  of  the  noetical world. 
This balance provides the  powerful guidance, and  here we  want will­
power and  right thinking. This is  exactly the  quality of  the  imprinting 
ether, of the etheric double of the noetical body. 
KINETIC  ETHER. The kinetic ether of  the  psychical body and the 
kinetic ether of  the  noeti_cal body work together, and  this cooperation 
is  easy. Willpower and thought equal movement in  the  psychical and 
noetical worlds.  But, first and  foremost the  imprinting ether must be 
balanced in  the  etheric doubles. In  the  material world kinesis (move­
ment) is the same: willpower and movement of the aesthetic and kinetic 
ethers.  But now there is a difficulty. Movements of your material body 
have to be done through the nervous system. 
So, to use the kinetic, aesthetic and imprinting ether to govern the mat­
erial body is a task.  It is easier to move the psychical and noetical bodies 
separately, or the psychonoetical body as one, than to move the material 
body to walk or to do certain work.  In other words, it is more difficult to 
use the kinetic and aesthetic ethers of the etheric double of the material 
body. The whole difficulty lies in the work on and in the material body. 
When we  leave the  material body,  the  whole work then is  know­
ledge, nothing else, a minimal effort is required. The effort is whenever 
we are in the material body and the aim is to use it. 
You  may ask  whether exosomatosis is  done in  the  psychonoetical 
body? Do we have a form? How is  balancing done? Balancing depends 
on  your own capability when you  leave the  material body. Balancing 
enables you to live, and more fully so,  when you are out of body. The 
Holy Spirit and the  Logos form your bodies.  Thus they are  forming 
the  material body. The Holy Spirit takes care of  your material body 
and you  find it ready. The same is valid for the psychical and noetical 
bodies. The formation of the psychical body is not done through your 
visualization. Of  course, when you  reach perfection, this perfection 
will form your psychical body. The Holy Spirit and your perfection do 
it, not you. 
What do I mean by perfection? 
A coarse, materialistic person has a very hard and inflexible psychi­
cal body. The colours of it correspond to his emotions and thoughts. If he 
starts to improve, and if he becomes better, more polite, well mannered, 
168 

more human, then and only then, will his psychical and noetical bodies 
be formed, without any effort. 
If an average person makes exosomatosis and  finds himself out of 
his material body, he will sleep; he will not get any impressions from the 
other worlds. It is as if he became blind in the psychical world. How 
many times have you heard people say, "I don't see any dreams." 
What does dream mean? Do you  know how  many  people don't know 
what thought is? Their thoughts imitate what is happening around them, 
nothing else. 
Let us have a look at the psychical and the noetical body. In actual 
fact we have two psychical bodies and etheric doubles. One is perfect, 
attuned to the Idea of Man, and it is within the material body. The other 
psychical body gets its form in the course of our life. The same happens 
with the noetical body and its etheric double. The perfect noetical body 
is the imprint of the Archangelic Heavenly Man; it is absolutely perfect. 
You will not move  it;  nor  will  you  move  within it.  The  other noelical 
body,  you will personally develop and live within it.  It has in  itself all 
the po�ers and you have to use and exercise the imprinting,  aesthetic, 
kinetic and creative ethers of the etheric double. 
When you will learn through visualization to create one, two, three, 
four,  five  or  six  psychical bodies within your  own,  i.e.  elementals of 
yourself, you will be  able  to  enter these elementals, to place in them 
imprinting,  aesthetic and  kinetic ethers, to  move them, and  transfer 
them without being in them. However, you have to be able to telepathi­
cally control and direct them. They are not your psychi�I body; they are 
elementals of yourself and you have created them. 
These elementals were created  through the etheric double of your 
personal psychical body, and this etheric double will have to absorb and 
assimilate all the elementals that are no longer needed·. 
Someone might ask:  "Who experiences exosomatosis, the present­
day- personality or  the  permanent personality?" We  said  many times 
that the permanent personality knows everything and can do anything at 
any given moment. So, it is the present-day-personality that must learn 
to do it. 
You  may  also  ask,  "In  order  to make  exosomatosis must  we  leave 
through the heart centre,  which is the centre of self-consciousness and 
awareness?" Not necessarily, but if you think that it is good for you, that is 
okay - personally, I like to do it from the centre of every cell of my mat­
erial body. Space has a different meaning in the fourth dimension.

Since the passing over of Dr.  Stylianos Atteshlis (Daskalos), his work has 
been carried on  by  his  daughter Panayiota Theotoki-Atteshli. She  spends 
much time every year  teaching her  father's philosophy in  workshops and 
seminars. She  is also dispatching the  mail-orders for  hooks, CDs, DVDs, 
and Videos. 
The following hooks and teaching material are available: 
JosHUA IMMANUEL THE CHRIST 
His  LIFE ON EARTH AND  His  TEACHINGS 
BY DR.  STYLIANOS ATIESHLIS (DASKALOS) 
Dr. Atteshlis wrote the manuscript of this book in the last years of his 
life.  It is an account of the events that happened two thousand years 
ago as witnessed by this Christian mystic. 
The book takes you on the travels of Joshua Immanuel in Palestine. 
Reading it, you can witness the healings and the so-called miracles, 
and you can hear the spiritual teaching he gave his disciples. The 
author concludes the book with: This is the teaching of Joshua: "Love 
Alaha, the Father of all mankind, with all your heart, with all your 
Soul, with all your mind, with all your Being, and love all human be­
ings, the offspring of Alaha, as your own Self." 
THE SYMBOL OF LIFE 
BY DR.  STYLIANOS ATIESHLIS (DASKALOS) 
Daskalos authored this  History,  Description and  Guide to  the  Symbol 
of  Life. The  book has  been published as  a  facsimile in  Daskalos' own 
handwriting (including ten of his coloured illustrations) with an English 
transcription and a German translation. 
The author traces the history of the Symbol of Life and explains its sym­
bolism. The serious student of this symbol of  Christian mysticism will 
find inspiration and guidance for meditation and work leading to higher 
levels of consciousness. 
THE  ESOTERIC  TEACHINGS 
BY DR.  STYLIANos ArrESHLIS (DASKALos) 
A Christian Approach to Truth: "The research of Truth is the necessity 

of every human being which will lead each one of us to seek knowledge 
about life and our own individual being." "Why should not all humanity, 
all sincere, thinking people, concern themselves with something beyond 
the material things of  Earth?" 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
BY DR. STYLIANOS ATTESHLIS (DASKALOS) 
This book exists as a companion volume to The Esoteric Teachings, by 
the same author, which details the more theoretical aspects. However, 
this book has also been designed to stand alone, as it contains not only 
many exercises and meditations, but also a short overview of the basic 
tenets and beliefs of this esoteric Christian approach to the Truth. 
A glossary at the back of the book  defines the terms and concepts used 
by  the  Researchers of Truth. 
THE PARABLES 
BY DR.  STYLIANOS ATTESHLIS (DASKALOS) 
Daskalos had often been asked to explain the inner meaning of the 
parables which were such a constant feature of the teachings of Jesus 
Christ. Here Daskalos comments on some parables in terms of his 
teachings. 
GATES TO THE LIGHT 
BY PANAYIOTA THEOTOKI-ATTESHLI 
Daskalos' daughter, who lovingly preserves the work of  Qaskalos, pro­
duced this excellent book. This work contains the illustrated exercises 
as practised by the. Researchers of Truth. The book contains 21 exer­
cises and meditations including archangelic attunement. 
GATES TO THE LIGHT - ON CD 
BY PANAYIOTA THEOTOKI-ATTESHLI 
These CDs contain the audio versions of the meditations found in the 
book Gates to the  Light. Panayiota's voice leads the seeker of truth 
gently through these exercises. 
TEACHINGS 
Many lectures of Daskalos have been recorded in the Stoa on audio 
cassettes and on videos. Many audio cassettes have now been trans­
ferred onto Compact Disc, and some videos cin DVD.
