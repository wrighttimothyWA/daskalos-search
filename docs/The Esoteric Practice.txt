This book exists as  a  companion volume to The Esoteric 
Teachings, 
by the same author, which details the more theo­
retical aspects of our work. However, this book has also been 
designed to stand alone, as we have provided a short overview 
of the basic tenets and beliefs of our esoteric Christian approach 
to Truth. 
While reading this text you are likely to come across terms 
unfamiliar to you and, perhaps, terms that you may have heard 
in other teachings and disciplines. Please note that our System 
for the Research of Truth employs some te1ms and concepts in 
a particular fashion. To avoid confusing our terminology with 
that of other schools of thought, and to gain clarity over the 
. material, we appeal to the reader to consult the glossary at the 
back of the book. 
To complement this title we will soon publish a collection of 
guided exercises and meditations by  Panayiota Atteshli­
Theotoki. Her work deals extensively with complex visualiza­
tion (a language of the Divine), leading to deep and intimate 
spheres of consciousness.

Tell me what salt tastes like. Can you? Can you describe 
to me the taste and sensation of salt? You may say that it 
is 
a white crystalline solid, chiefly composed of sodium 
chloride. 
You may also say that its chemical composition 
is NaCl. But I tell you this: until you first place some salt 
on your tongue you will not know the taste of salt. So, what 
do we need to do? We need to take a pick and head to the 
salt mines! 
Daskalos 
And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, 
and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 
Luke 11:9 
I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy 
testimonies are my meditations. 
Psalms 119:99 

O God, my Father, make my footsteps upon life's path as 
light as they may be. Let me not raise dust, in anger or 
greed, that blinds my brothers and sisters. Make my steps 
light upon life's path. Make my heart, 0 God, my Father, 
a 
crystal-clear mirror to reflect Your Love, my love, and 
to allow my fellow humans to rejoice.

INTRODUCTION 
It is with great pleasure that we present this book of exercises 
and meditations into the hands of all seekers. 
It is not enough 
that we apply ourselves to the study of words and theory. We 
have to explore and experience the inner reaches of ourselves, 
of life, and of Creation. 
Feeling the need to be in the presence of a Master, or the 
desire to  surround yourself  with all  the  sacred books of the 
world, is not unlike relying on crutches to move along 
the way. 
You must be with yourself, sincerely and fearlessly exploring 
life. The world around us grows increasingly complex, full of 
distractions 
and temptations that threaten our attentiveness. Yet 
we  must be  steadfast and apply ourselves unceasingly, for 
although the texture of our lives has changed across the centu­
ries, the  human condition, experience and purpose remain 
unaltered and eternal. Work towards progress within yourself. 
Learn to discriminate. Draw proper conclusions. 
Let us  remember that in  our lives there is  no  more 
demanding work than our pursuit of Truth. Religious involve­
ment is  not a  passive engagement, but an  active struggle to 
clean the heart and clear the mind. Yet the harder the labour, the 

xii 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
sweeter the fruit. The rewards of cultivating a holy personality 
continue long after the material body gives way. 
Become familiar with the  state of your  gross material 
body and keep it in good order. Bring your psychical ( e
�
o­
tional) body  into  a  healthy exchange with  your  noetlcal 
(reasoning) body. Your present-day personality, with its thr
�
e 
bodies, 
is a vehicle for the collection and distillation of expen­
ence towards the edification and fullness of your Permanent 
· Personality. You must try to attune your present-day self
. 
to
your Permanent Personality. With the aid of your Guard
�
an
Angel, your Permanent Personality is continuously proddmg
you on,  guiding the way.  Emotions and desires need  t
� 
be
placed under the wisdom of moderation and reason. There 1s no
other way.
It is central to our work that we strive to  develop our
capacity for:
OBSERVATION - Attention without tension. Without the
ability to  observe and  to  recall  in  detail  what  you  have
observed, your awareness of, and attunement to, the Divine
Plan is, at best, imperfect. Observation is an expression of our
Divine nature.
CONCENTRATION - This is one of the prime necessities for
creative thinking and for healing. You must learn to conc
�
ntra
�
e
all your thoughts on a subject of contemplat
�
on or an obJ
_
ec
� 
m
hand.  One's concentration should focus, hke  a  magmfymg
glass, so that it becomes so absorbed, unmoved by external
forces, as to suspend the present-day self (attunement and at­
one-ment).
VISUALIZATION - By learning to observe carefully and to
concentrate fully, the ability to visualize properly becomes
easier. Some bemoan the fact that they cannot visualize, but
INTRODUCTION 
xiii 
in  fact  we  all  visualize subconsciously in  the  creation of 
elementals. This  is  the  way  we  create our  world. There  is 
nothing more powerful than thought, and visualization is the 
process of harnessing thought in a constructive manner for the 
expansion of consciousness and aiding others in need. 
INTROSPECTION -An inner exploration to trace the sources 
of your emotional and noetical behaviour with the resolve to 
self-consciously structure your  personality and  its  subcon­
scious. The determination to free the self from the limitations 
of  egoism, by releasing 'your conscience from dead works' 
(Hebr. 9:14), is moving towards the wise and loving voice of 
the Soul. 
MEDITATION - The inner reaches of introspection become 
the  outer  reaches of  meditation, as  the  exploration moves 
beyond the subjective experience of the present-day personality 
into the boundless ocean of Mind, towards alignment with the 
universal and eternal. 
Of that which is universal and eternal there is none greater 
than Love, for 'there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth 
out fear' (1 John 4:18). The Love of Absolute Beingness is at 
the very heart of the cosmos and the Source of all Creation. It 
is the same Love to which we owe our Source, and the same 
Love which lives in our hearts.

THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
OUR LORD'S PRAYER 
After the Sermon on the Mount, Joshua Emmanuel the 
Christ 
was asked by  a  disciple, 'in what way should we pray?' (cf. 
Matt. 6:9 &  Luke 11:2). 
Then, and 
on other occasions 
the 
God-man gave us His 
prayer. Our version 
of the Lord's 
P;ayer 
and the complete 
second stanza have 
been given 
to us by the 
Spirit of Y ohannan the Evangelist, an apostle of 
Joshua. 
Recitation 
of the Lord's 
Prayer, either 
silently 
or spoken aloud, 
is appropriate 
before 
beginning any sacred 
work. 
OUR LORD'S PRAYER 
Our Father 
Who Art in Heaven 
' 
Hallowed be Thy Name. 
Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, 
on earth as it is in Heaven. 
Give 
us this day our daily 
bread 
and forgive us our 
transgressions as we 
forgive 
those who transgress against 
us. 
And lead 
us while 
in temptation 
and deliver us from evil, 
for Thine is the Kingdom 
and the Power 
and the Glory, 
Forever. 
Absolute 
Infinite Beingness, God; 
Everlasting Life, Love 
and Mercy; 
Manifesting Yourself in Yourself 
' 
as the 
Total 
Wisdom and the 
Almightiness; 
Enlighten 
our minds to 
understand 
You as the 
Truth. 
Clean our hearts to reflect Your 
Love towards You, and 
towards all other human beings. 
Amen 
3 

When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as  the hypocrites 
are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and 
in 
the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. 
Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, 
when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou 
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; 
and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee 
openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as th
_
e 
heathen do.for they think that they shall be heard for their 
much speaking. 
Matthew 6:5-7 
ON EXERCISE AND MEDITATION 
A Conversation with Stylianos Atteshlis 
Paul Skorpen: Dear Daskale, the call has become great for a 
collection of  exercises and meditations to  be assembled to 
complement the lessons you are offering. We now ask you to 
share your comments on the nature of proper exercise and 
meditation in relation to our theoretical understandings. 
Daskalos: This is very precious work, most vital to our effort to 
understand and experience the relative truths and advance in 
our development. It is not enough that we sit and talk and talk, 
for as I often repeat in the lessons we must not accept anything 
unless we ourselves have experienced it. Truths unexperienced 
quickly degenerate into dogmatism. 
P:  This seems true. We encounter so  many researchers who 
believe that it is only a matter of greater and new material that 
will lead to enlightenment. I often wonder if to draw closer to 
the Truth we need to know less and experience more? 
D: Absolutely true. It is less a question of accumulation and 
more a matter of discovering and purifying what we already 
have, what we already are. We cannot become something that 
we are not already! 

6 
THE ESOTERIC 
PRACTICE 
P: In your lessons we hear you stress the value of 
observation, 
concentration 
and meditation. 
Could you say more here about 
what you mean by these terms? 
D: 
These are skills that a Researcher 
must develop to master 
himself* 
and the circumstances 
with which he is confronted. 
Observation, 
part  of  our Divine nature,  requires 
that 
nothing escape our attention 
either in the gross material 
world 
or in the planes of the psychical 
and noetical worlds. Concen­
tration entails focusing 
our attention 
completely 
on a subject, 
emotion, 
thought, 
or idea. The size is no matter; remember 
what Joshua said, 'He that is faithful in that which is least is 
faithful 
also in much' [Luke 16:10]. We need to develop the 
skill 
of concentration 
to such a degree that nothing moves us 
from our work. Meditation, 
which utilizes both 
observation 
and 
concentration, 
entails contemplation 
and investigation 
of a 
subject. 
P: Of late you have been stressing 
the importance 
of 'visuali­
zation'. 
D: 
Proper visualization 
is indispensable 
in our work as I have 
always insisted. It is one of the 'keys' [cf Matt. 16:19] that so 
many speculate 
about. The exercises 
and meditations 
which 
follow all require the ability  to visualize: 
to form psycho­
noetical 
super-substance 
into  the  creation 
of  objects  and 
situations. 
For those unfamiliar 
with the work of visualization 
we will provide basic guidance 
leading into more advanced 
work. We must not be overly intimidated 
by the importance 
of 
visualization. 
All things will come in time. 
P: Could you then describe 
the purpose 
of this work? What is 
the 
difference 
between 
an exercise 
and a meditation? 
•
For the sake of simplicity, 
the author has decided to employ the male pronoun 
throughout 
this 
book.
ON EXERCISE 
AND MEDITATION 
7 
D: 
We all must begin somewhere, 
at some point of reference. 
There is work for those just beginning 
and there is work for 
those on the way. 
An exercise involves 
a series of successive 
movements 
(using visualization) 
towards developing 
the conditions 
for an 
intimate exposure 
to sacred energies 
and spheres. 
Meditation 
is more passive as it involves reflection 
and introspection. 
The 
difference 
is not great and often an exercise 
will lead into a 
meditation. 
P: And prayer? 
D: 
Prayer is another matter. Although 
here again if an exercise 
or meditation 
leads you into sacred space, exposing 
you to 
Divine forces, you may feel 
the need to pray. Prayer comes 
from the heart. And just as tears born of emotion own a separ­
ate chemical 
composition 
f
r
om those born of physical 
pain, 
prayers - whether spoken with words or with thoughts 
-have 
different 
vibratory patterns 
from any other expression. They 
spring from our deepest nature and seek the ear of the Divine. 
What is asked for in prayer should be heartfelt, 
not serving 
egoism, 
and  dearly  desired, 
for  sincere  prayer  is always 
heard. 
P: And, therefore, 
we should be careful what it is we desire, for 
'all things, whatsoever 
ye shall ask in prayer, believing, 
ye shall 
receive' 
[Matt. 21:22]. Where do we begin with meditation? 
D: 
Meditation 
is practised 
in varying degrees. 
You cannot jump 
ahead but have to go slowly by mastering 
each step along the 
way. 
The first field of work (let us call it the  'microcosm') 
concerns 
the cleansing 
of the present-day 
personality. 
This 
cleansing 
is ceaseless 
work and even so-called 
Masters 
must 
keep constant 
vigil against the emergence 
of egoism. Through 

8 
THE ESOTERIC 
PRACTICE 
study 
we set  about 
to understand 
the  nature 
of elementals. 
Remember, 
we teach that the sum total of all the elementals 
which 
we  create, 
assimilate 
and  re-energize, 
compose 
our 
present-day 
personality. 
P: And because 
elementals 
can be characterized 
by their quali­
ty, 
and numbered 
in their quantity, 
we speak both in qualitative 
and quantitative 
terms of a personality. 
D: 
Indeed, 
a  personality 
encumbered 
with  demanding 
and 
emotional 
elementals 
( of  desire, 
greed, 
lust,  envy), 
or 
entrenched 
in a pattern 
of beliefs 
and attitudes 
(full of expec­
tations, 
preconceptions, 
categories, 
dogmatic 
ideas, prejudices) 
is 
a heavy 
personality 
and more likely to cause 
problems 
to 
himself 
and others. 
So, if our study brings 
us to an awareness 
of the nature 
of 
elementals, 
then it is through 
exercise 
and meditation 
that we 
begin 
to weed out the corrupt 
and allow the beautiful 
to flourish. 
P: John the Baptist 
said, 'He must increase, 
but I must decrease' 
[John 3:30]. 
D: 
This is the good work of cleansing 
- call it purifying 
if you 
want - the personality; 
removing 
the clutter, 
cultivating 
love, 
tolerance 
and charity, 
and allowing 
room for the Divine 
to live 
and work. Lightening 
the personality. 
P: This reminds 
me of what Michelangelo 
would say of every 
piece 
of marble 
he saw, 'I see a figure struggling 
to come out.' 
Or Meister 
Eckhart 
when he said, 'God is not found in the soul 
by adding 
anything 
but by a process 
of subtraction.' 
D: 
Well back in ancient 
Egypt 
there is the image 
of Anubis 
weighing 
the heart-
the psychical 
heart-
of a man who has just 
passed-over, 
against 
a feather. 
A clean heart is a light heart 
and is the home of our logoic 
consciousness. 
ON EXERCISE 
AND MEDITATION 
9 
Amongst 
the elementals 
within 
each personality 
the Self­
aware 
Soul is trying 
to emerge 
and express 
Itself as 'a voice in 
the wilderness' 
[John 
1 :23 
J. 
The Teachings 
of the God-man 
Joshua 
the Christ 
will help us pare away the egoism 
which 
imprisons 
us in our shells. 
P: It's as if we will remain 
stuck in our shells as long as our 
personality 
is preoccupied 
with the five senses, 
base desires, 
unbridled 
emotions 
and the appetites 
of the flesh. 
D: 
The expansion 
of consciousness, 
and exosomatosis, 
are dif­
ficult when ninety-five 
per cent of an individual's 
conscious­
ness is concerned 
with material 
things 
and base desires; 
'He 
that is of the earth is earthly' 
[John 
3:31]. 
As eager as people 
are 
for exosomatosis, 
as long as their personality 
is tied to the 
material 
world they will be limited 
in their success,fastened 
to 
their material 
bodies. 
P: And yet with time we will succeed 
... 
D: 
Definitely! 
For the larva can only remain 
so long in the 
cocoon 
( the present-day 
personality) 
before 
those 
quarters 
grow too confining. 
Soon it will want to stretch 
out its wings 
and take .flight 
(the Permanent 
Personality). 
This is a natural 
Law, the inexorable 
Law of the Circle 
of Possibility. 
Growth 
is 
inevitable 
no matter 
how much 
it seems 
people 
enjoy 
their 
cocoon; 
as 'it shall come to pass afte,ward, 
that I will pour out 
my spirit upon al/flesh' 
[Joel 2:28]. 
P: And Christ says, 'I go to prepare 
a place for you' [John 14:2]. 
Yet I wonder 
if it is we who have a need to clear a place for Him 
within our hearts and minds? 
D: 
He is already 
there ... no, it is even more than that, He 
is 
our 
hearts 
and minds. 

10 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
So how then does our work help in this great Work? Take 
for example our most valued exercise, that of daily introspec­
tion. If we dedicate ourselves to introspection -and I mean all 
of  us - we will see with ever-increasing clarity when we are 
acting out of self-interest ( causing harm to ourselves and oth­
ers) and when we are guided by virtue and principle. Other 
exercises aid in the effort of identifying destructive elementals 
within our personality, and slowly replacing them with life­
giying elementals. 
P: Matthew writes in his Gospel, 'Cleanse first that which is 
within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean 
also' [23:26]. With this in mind it seems that the first work, 
before aspiring to develop any psycho-noetical abilities, is to 
put  in  order what we  have as  our  desires, emotions and 
thoughts. 
D: It is a most dangerous situation when uncontrolled hunger 
for 
psychical experience moves a seeker to engage himself in 
str@ng exercises without first laying the groundwork within the 
personality to cope with the ensuing experience. The damage is 
often irreparable when an emotionally immature student opens 
certain etheric centres [Sanskrit: chakras] and has neither the 
means nor the strength to re-collect himself. We must be well 
grounded, rooted in love and faith. 'If the roots be holy, so are 
the branches' [Rom. 1/: 16]. 
P: Do you take issue with Westerners who are engaged in cer­
tain Eastern practices? 
D: I have seen many,far too many, come to me, who have been 
practising Eastern breathing techniques, having their nervous 
systems shattered by interfering with the energy centres in an 
aggressive manner - disregarding the delicate and careful 
work of  the Archangels. We have to  constantly remind our-
ON EXERCISE AND MEDITATION 
11 
selves that it is not a matter of coincidence that we are born 
where we are born. IJJ, the East people are born to learn specific 
lessons, 
as we have our lessons in the West. We each come into 
this world with a psycho-noetical constitution that inclines us 
towards certain practices and prohibits us from others. In the 
West, for example, we are raised to believe that our personality 
is quite independent of others, while in the East the sense of self 
is more communal and less atomized. 
Another thing that distinguishes our work from that of the 
East is our handling of the 'lower self, or as we term it, the 
present-day personality. The thrust of many Eastern schools is 
to stamp out the lower self and exist in a kind of void -of the 'no 
self '.  We, on the other hand, see the Soul latent in  the 
present-day self. We work towards raising up the lower 
expressions of  the self into a  unified Individuated Selfhood. 
They seem to desire to live in a state of emptiness, whereas we 
work towards a  state of  fullness, embracing all. We will get 
nowhere ifwe do not appreciate all aspects of the Selfhood. 
Our psycho-noetical physiology, as it were, is not able to 
cope with many of the Eastern practices. 
P: Perhaps some are just in a hurry? 
D: 
To that Christ said, 'If I have told you earthly things, and ye 
believe not, how shall ye believe, if I  tell you of  heavenly 
things?' [John 3:12]. The greatest poison to spiritual growth is 
to be in a hurry. Patience and moderation are the rule; the work 
is a transformation of all our misguided thoughts and actions. 
This is the most valuable work. Later we will explore greater 
truths. All things in due time. 
It is, therefore, a primary responsibility for those who are 
interested in the Truth to learn all that is permissible concern­
ing the human bodies. With the help of the Archangels, we need 

12 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
to master our etheric doubles, and control the etheric vitality 
(in the four forms of ether: sensate, imprint, kinetic and crea­
tive) for use in our psycho-noetical development, maintaining 
our health and the health of others. 
P: 
Of the exercises to follow would you say that students of 
psycho-therapy and practising psycho-therapists would benefit 
from a particular line of work? 
D: Those interested 
in the bodily and psychical health of others 
will easily see that certain exercises will help them in their 
work.  But  as  Researchers of  the  Truth  we  contend that 
psycho-therapists need to develop all their faculties evenly. 
Therefore, we encourage them to work in all the fields -theo­
retical and experiential -to become ever more effective in their
professions. Psycho-therapists seek resolution and growth, and
is this not the work we are all engaged in?
P: 
If work on the present-day personality is in the microcosmic 
field, could you speak a little about the nature of mesocosmic 
work? 
D: We have to be 
careful with our conceptions, as they are 
limited by time-place contingencies. Remember that Joshua 
Emmanuel the Christ speaks about, 'the kingdom of Heavens 
within'. We cannot divide our research into that which takes 
place within the personality and that which is conducted out­
side. As above, so below.  All we explore outside the self -
Divine Laws, Principles, Ideas, Causes, and the Heavens -
actually belongs to our higher nature. 
Yet, we need to speak in relative terms for now. The so­
called mesoco_ymic work is an exploration of Total Wisdom, 
Love and Power in the worlds, leading to self-conscious and 
responsible engagement in  the  Divine  Plan.  This  work 
engenders within the personality a respect for all of life, a 
ON EXERCISE AND MEDITATION 
13 
respect for self and others. Mesocosmic labours include our 
work on the etheric doubles for good health and healing pur­
poses, 
working with 
controlled elementals for the construction 
of 
light-balls, and beginning to attune ourselves to objects and 
forms 
within the material, psychical and noetical worlds. We 
will  marvel at  the  immeasurable Wisdom of  Absolute 
Beingness. 
P: In your work it seems you do not devalue the material world. 
Some systems of the East, as well as many in the West, consider 
the material world an illusion, maya [a Sanskrit term], some­
thing to escape, overcome, and detach ourselves from. 
D: 
Do you think that Absolute Beingness, in/ts infinite Wisdom, 
would allow for the creation of the material world if it were not 
of  value?  Do  you  think  that  the Archangels would  work 
unceasingly to construct and maintain the material planet and 
universe, keeping them in harmony, if it were not meant to be 
the home of the phenomenon of life?  Our material bodies 
belong to the material world as our psychical bodies belong to 
the psychical world. It is a great honour to participate in this 
glorious earth as 'this is none other but the house of God, and 
this is the gate of heaven' [Gen. 28:17]. The flesh, though 
heavy at times, and the earth are sacred. It is a pity to degrade, 
in any way, this paradise for it 'is holy ground' [Ex. 3:5]. 
P: Is it that our material bodies share the wisdom of the earth? 
D: 
The  Wisdom, Love  and  Power  of  matter.  Remember 
Absolute Beingness is -and is in -everything.
We know of greater realities in the higher worlds, and 
supreme realities beyond the worlds of separation. But we are 
here now and the world is a paradise with much, much to learn 
from. The sheer majesty of the human body, and the cosmic 
bodies, escape the comprehension of doctors and scientists. We 

14 
THE ESOTERIC 
PRACTICE 
must 
not 
demean 
matter, 
but 
we 
should 
respect 
and 
use 
it 
properly. 
Could 
there 
be a better 
school 
than 
the material 
world? 
If we properly 
understand 
and 
take 
our 
lessons 
f
r
om 
all  our 
trials 
and 
tribulations, 
and 
not 
become 
too 
absorbed 
with 
earthly 
joys 
and 
triumphs, 
there 
is so much 
to learn 
here. 
It is 
a perfect 
school: 
the seasons 
of our 
lives, 
our 
varied 
relation­
ships, 
our 
personal 
struggles, 
our 
failures 
and 
successes. 
The 
Divine 
Plan 
is at work 
here. 
P: Would 
you say something 
about 
detachment. 
D: 
Detachment, 
as we understand 
it,  means 
neither 
over-
nor 
undervaluing 
anything. 
In  other 
words 
there 
is  a  place 
for 
everything. 
What 
is to be avoided 
is to become 
embroiled 
in and 
overly 
dependent 
on material 
goods, 
material 
aims, 
or,  con­
versely, 
to value 
only 
the higher 
worlds. 
We are 
fundamentally 
opposed 
to any 
system 
of exercise 
adopted 
by  Westerners 
which 
creates 
a  division 
between 
the 
mundane 
and 
the Divine 
and 
a gulf 
between 
a meditative 
state 
and 
a normal 
waking 
state. 
It is not 
healthy, 
nor 
respectful, 
to 
annihilate 
either 
the natural 
world 
or the lower 
body 
belonging 
to it. 
P: I infer 
then that you feel uncomfortable 
with 
systems 
which 
require 
meditation 
periods 
of several 
hours 
a day, 
and retreats 
that span 
months, 
even 
years? 
D: 
Again, 
such 
a thing 
may 
be appropriate 
in certain 
traditions, 
but we, 
as Christians, 
believe 
in service 
-
not withdrawing 
from 
our 
fellow 
humans 
who 
may 
need 
our 
help. 
We stress 
engage­
ment 
in the world, 
but not enslavement 
to it. For 
as Joshua 
said, 
You 
'are 
not of the world, 
even 
as I am not of the world' 
[John 
17:16]. 
ON EXERCISE 
AND MEDITATION 
15 
If, from 
time 
to time, 
one 
has 
an opportunity 
to spend 
a 
few 
days 
in the mountains 
or by the seashore, 
in meditation 
and 
contemplation, 
that 
is most 
renewing 
and 
advisable. 
We spend 
too 
little 
time 
in  nature 
and 
far too 
little 
time 
in silence. 
It is 
good 
to escape 
the chaos 
every 
now 
and 
then, 
but we have 
work 
to do. 
P: What 
is an appropriate 
measure 
of meditation? 
D: 
Let 
me put it this 
way. 
Say 
you 
have 
a seedling. 
You 
expose 
it to the sun, 
good 
soil 
and 
each 
day 
give 
it a little 
water. 
It will 
grow 
in its own 
course. 
But 
if you 
decide 
to put 
it in the 
hot 
midday 
sun, 
or water 
it to the point 
of drowning 
its roots, 
it will 
surely 
shrivel 
up and 
die. 
By exercising 
too 
much 
there 
is a 
danger 
in  over-meditating, 
creating 
an 
extreme 
division 
between 
the 
periods 
of  meditation 
and 
your 
normal 
waking 
state. 
We only 
encourage 
periods 
of fifteen 
minutes 
or so, two 
or three 
times 
a day. 
I have 
seen 
many, 
too 
many, 
who 
have 
severely 
damaged 
their 
nervous 
systems 
through 
excessive 
meditation. 
We are 
in the world 
and 
must, 
dialectically, 
work 
with 
it. 
P: St. Paul 
writes 
in Romans, 
'For the invisible 
things 
of God 
from 
the creation 
of the world 
are clearly 
seen, 
being 
under­
stood 
by the things 
which 
are made' 
[1 :20]. 
D: 
Well 
stated. 
One 
of the most 
valuable 
exercises 
we instruct 
is the exploration 
of the Circles 
of Possibility 
inscribed 
to each 
form. 
For 
when 
we  understand 
the 
single 
life-course 
of  the 
smallest 
thing 
in nature, 
we will 
see a testimony 
of the Greatest. 
We 
should 
study 
all phenomena 
of life 
in order 
to expand 
our 
understanding 
and 
experience. 
This 
most 
edifying 
work 
requires 
centuries. 
P: Our study 
of the Circles 
of Possibility 
- the 'hands' 
behind 
the sculptor 
- lead us naturally 
to an examination 
of the macro­
cosm. 

16 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
D: Yes, for if we understand that the forms of all things have 
within them a heartbeat and a metabolism -the Circle of Pos­
sibility-we are drawing closer to the causes. This is our work, 
this is  life itself; drawing closer to our Cause ...  to our 
Source. 
Exercise and meditation at higher levels mean exploring, 
attuning to, and eventually becoming unified ( at-one-ment) 
with 
the Causes, Principles, Ideas, and Laws. Each Circle of 
Possibility works according to the Divine forces of Total Love, 
Power and Wisdom. These most pe,fect forces of life are within 
our archangelic human form. Ecstasy, real ecstasy, is aligning 
ourselves with the Divine. 
P: This is all very humbling. 
D: Humbling for the egoism of the present-day personality, but 
inspiring for the Ego of the Permanent Personality. 
P:  Could you say more about at-one-ment? 
D: At-one-ment is the great goal: the longing for communion 
with the Divine. Through transcendence of the egoism the per­
sonality can assimilate itself with anything - and this is 
important -temporarily suspending the self. As we advance in 
our 
work, through time and effort, we will be able to unify our 
nature with that of the Archangels, the Virgin Mary, and the 
Christ Logos [Gr. XQWToavaaraaia, Cristoanastasia: union 
with Christ]. Theosis is the culmination of the work, where the 
Self-aware 
Soul realizes Its unity with Absolute Beingness. I 
say 'realizes' because we are all always in at-one-ment with 
Absolute Beingness; only ignorance allows us to feel any 
dis­
tance between God and us. There is no such distance. 
P: Macrocosmic meditation, as it were, seems less a pursuit or 
practice, and more a state of Beingness. I do not think we are 
ON EXERCISE AND MEDITATION 
17 
talking any longer about periods and states of meditation but a 
complete transformation of the self? 
D: St. Paul asks us to, 'pray without ceasing' [I Ths. 5:17]. We 
should always be in a state of reverence for life, aware of our 
place in the Divine Plan, living in God, which means, as 
Yohannan says, 'in love' [I John 4:16]. Love isn't something 
you 
do or feel only on Sunday mornings. It  is the continuous 
and 
eternal Truth. Love is  each 
of  us in  the Common Self­
hood. 
P: The 'Common Selfhood'? 
D: Each of  us is a  logos and together we are unified in  the 
Christ Logos. This means that each of us is actually part of a 
single 
body. This union is at all levels -noetical, psychical, and 
even physical -as molecular biology now understands that we 
are constantly exchanging matter with one another. Even with 
the 
denseness of gross matter we are in constant exchange. Can 
you 
imagine the interchange with the less tangible forms of 
Mind, emotions and thoughts? So we see that it is not only in the 
higher 
levels that we 
are unified, but also in the worlds of sep­
aration. 
When 
we harm another we only harm ourselves. When a 
child starves in Africa, part of us starves. When a child is born 
into a healthy caring family in any part of the world, part of us 
is 
born. When a soldier dies in Bosnia, part of us is slain. We 
are both the assailant and the assailed. 
This is what Christ 
taught. Christ spoke of a King who said, 'I was naked, and ye 
clothed 
me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in 
prison, and 
ye came unto me.' Bemused, the praised could not recall the 
acts of  compassion. And Joshua the Christ, the King of  the 
Heavens, explained, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the 
least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me' [Matt. 25 :35 40 J. 

18 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
This is the Common Selfhood. In another place Joshua speaks 
of this: 'I am the vine, ye are the branches' [John I5:5]. That 
we all share an equal place in the body of Christ is one of the 
most profound and greatest truths. 
P: Joshua continues ' ... for without me ye can do nothing' [John 
15:5]. I  fear that some may shy away from such a  heavily 
Christian message? For Christ also says, 'no man cometh unto 
the Father, but by me' [John 14:6]. 
D: What did  Joshua mean when He said, 'I am the way, the 
truth, 
and the life' [John 14:6]. What is Christ? What is the 
Logos? Is it not Love, Wisdom and Power? This is a sacred 
triangle: 
the  universal, unconditional Love from above; the 
Wisdom of a unified heart and mind; and the Power of Good­
ness to overcome weakness. What Christ was saying for those 
'with ears to hear' [Mark 4:23] was that any man or woman 
who uses reason, love and power in the proper and Divine way 
is a Christian, be he called a Buddhist, a Muslim or any other 
brother or  sister from the  many faiths. The Church has  so 
misunderstood this point. Joshua comes to us to f
r
ee 
us from 
illusions, not to oppress us. Why did He come? He said it: 'I am 
come that they might have life, and that they might have it more 
abundantly' [John 10:10]. 
P: The practice of meditation in the West seems to have been 
repressed, if not indeed suffocated by certain forces? 
D: This has been the course of things, but let us not see it as 
regrettable. It is what happened. What is lamentable is that so 
many 
continue to feel the need to go to the East - to India or 
elsewhere -because they believe they will find something that 
Christianity fails to offer. They often return more disenchanted 
than before they left. Christianity has eve,ything and it belongs 
to us - it is our tradition; it belongs to our bodies, our hearts 
ON EXERCISE AND MEDITATION 
19 
and 
our minds. So  'drink waters out of thine own cistern, and 
running 
waters out of thine own well' [Prov. 5:15]. 
The church is the church, reflecting the Love of the God­
man 
to greater or lesser degrees, built of stone and some old 
ideas. 
Christ doesn't care how much gold may gild a church 
[Matt. 
23:16-19]. His concern is for  what goes on  within a 
temple. The church is a holy place as it demarcates a sacred 
area, a place of 
M!
orship. But the real church is the human form, 
with the three bodies. We 'are the temple of God'[] Car. 3:16]. 
Within 
us is the holy of holies, an inner sanctum, in the heart 
of every man and woman. This temple can neither be soiled, nor 
destroyed. Go there, supplicate, pray and work. Christ is there. 
He awaits you. 

20 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
THE SEVEN PROMISES 
Daskalos has long enjoyed the companionship of a Master on 
the other side. For nearly two thousand years Daskalos has been 
in continuous communication with Y ohannan, with whom he 
shared the blessed period of Joshua Emmanuel the Christ. 
In this incarnation Daskalos renewed his communion with 
Y ohannan at a very young age. When Daskalos was seven years 
old 
Y ohannan bestowed on him the Seven Promises which are 
the vows of all Researchers of Truth. 
The promises embody a timeless pledge to the Divine 
Plan. Taking moral guidance from the promises through daily 
meditation an aspirant will, in time, attune himself to the Divine 
Laws of Creation. 
THE SEVEN PROMISES 
I PROMISE TO MYSELF: 
To serve at all times and in all places 
Absolute Beingness to whom 
I whole-heartedly belong. 
To be ready at all times and 
in all places to serve the Divine Plan. 
To make good use of the Divine Gifts 
of thought and word at all times, 
in an places and under all circumstances. 
To endure patiently, without complaining, 
all forms of trials and tribulation which the most wise 
Divine Law may bestow upon me. 
To love and serve my fellow human beings 
sincerely from the depths of my heart and Soul, 
no matter what their behaviour may be towards me. 
To meditate and to contemplate daily 
Absolute Beingness, with the objective of total 
coordination of my thoughts, desires, words 
and actions with Its Divine Will. 
To investigate and check every night whether 
all my thoughts, desires, words and actions 
are in absolute harmony with the Divine Law. 
21 

If 
you cast yourself into a sea, without any guidance, this 
is full of danger, because man mistakes things which arise 
within 
himself for  things arising elsewhere. If,  on  the 
other hand, you travel on a sea in a ship, this is perilous, 
because there is danger of attachment to the vehicle. In 
the  one 
case, the  end  is  not  known, and  there is  no 
guidance. In the other case, the means becomes an end, 
and there is no arriving. 
Niffari 
But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no 
thought beforehand what ye  shall speak, neither do ye 
premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you  in  that 
hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy 
Ghost. 
Mark 13:11 
THE  ESOTERIC TEACHINGS 
A Christian Approach to Truth 
If teachings, as theory, attempt to lay out the terrain of Truth, 
mark the guideposts and  suggest a path,  then exercises and 
meditations are  vehicles to  carry consciousness to  higher 
ground. 
The primary work, however, is to cleanse our personality 
so that we can see clearly where we currently stand and where 
we are headed. Only after an individual has situated himself 
within his personality (which is no  small feat) is he able to 
move on to heavenly matters. Hand in hand with the expansion 
of consciousness, is the need to refine and direct our conscious 
awareness. 
Yet there is always a danger when beginning a work to 
foresee or imagine its end. It is a basic truth, and a very human 
folly,  that the more we impose our ideas, our concepts and 
expectations on what lies ahead, the less capable we are to see 
things as  they  actually are.  Seldom do  our  expectations 
approximate the experience, and almost always they seem to 
compromise our access to the real nature of things. We must 
practise care with the ideas we create, as they may, in the end, 

24 
THE ESOTERIC 
PRACTICE 
serve 
to create us. In what way are we capable, 
from where we 
stand 
now, to measure 
and to see what we  have set out to 
find? 
We 
are fortunate 
that the pursuit 
of Truth has been dear to 
the 
hearts of many who have gone before us. Sages, masters, 
prophets 
and teachers 
from all over the world and in every 
epoch have bestowed 
great treasures 
upon us. Each path 
and 
each 
religion 
reflects 
another 
face of the great gem of Truth. 
There 
exists  a  huge  corpus 
of written 
and  oral  teachings 
devoted 
to the common 
eternal 
Truth. All have contributed 
invaluably 
to  our  developing 
understanding 
of  Absolute 
Beingness 
and the Divine 
Plan. 'Her ways are ways of pleasant­
ness, and all her paths are peace' (Prov. 
3: 17). 
Twenty 
centuries 
ago in Palestine 
all researchers, 
Arch­
angels, 
angels, 
and demigods 
rejoiced 
as Joshua 
Emmanuel 
the 
Christ was born among 
us. Joshua, 
who comes to us 
directly
from Absolute 
Beingness 
(as distinct 
from all human 
Masters 
who  earn  their  wisdom 
through 
successive 
incarnations) 
offered 
for the first time the direct guidance 
of God.  What 
Joshua 
taught, 
by deed and word, during 
His short corporeal 
life  remains 
with  us  as  the  most  pure,  direct  and  Divine 
Teachings. 
As the Son of man He was the 'flesh and blood' of 
Truth (John 
6:33). It is Christ as the Logos, 
the Son of God, 
who is the inextinguishable 
Light and the everlasting 
Life, the 
'bread and wine' of Truth (John 6:32). The �ogos is the eternal 
nature of humanity, 
compelling 
us towards 
perfection 
through 
the gentle and lasting 
exaltation 
of consciousness 
as 'the true 
Light, which lighteth 
every man that cometh 
into the world' 
(John 1:9). 
Ours is a Christian 
path in celebration 
of Joshua's 
Teach­
ings. We believe 
in the one Truth, the one God, which inspires 
THE ESOTERIC 
TEACHINGS 
25 
religious 
traditions, 
esoteric 
and  exoteric, 
past  and present. 
Differing 
in expression 
only, the ageless 
human 
effort to reflect 
the Divine 
is guided 
'by the same Spirit' (1 Cor. 12:9). 
Esoteric 
Christianity 
is not the privilege 
of the few, but a 
faithful 
reflection 
of the Soul of each of us. The meaning 
of the 
term  'esoteric' 
has become 
severed 
from its Greek roots. In 
Greek EOWTEQLX6 
(esoteriko) 
indicates 
knowledge 
found with­
in us, 'for nothing 
is secret, 
that shall not be made manifest'·· 
(Luke 8: 17). Inner Christianity, 
as 'the secrets 
of his heart made 
manifest' 
(1 Cor. 14:25), 
is less a religion 
and more the very 
nature 
of life - a   clear, concise 
and complete 
mirror 
of the 
Truth. 
Let us review 
what we believe 
to be the way things 
are. 
Absolute 
Beingness 
God is Love; and he that dwelleth in love 
dwelleth in God, and God in him. 
1 John  4:16 
What. 
Is, 
what always 
Was, 
and what always 
Will Be 
is the 
Absolute 
Infinite 
Beingness, 
God the Father, 
as the Absolute 
Infinite 
Reality. 
Of Absolute 
Infinite 
Beingness 
there is very 
little that we can trace and come to lmow from the human 
per­
spective 
in the gross material 
world. What we know of God we 
see in reflection 
as witnessed 
both externally 
and inwardly. 
In 
order for light to become 
apparent 
it must be reflected 
off a 
surface. 
Everything 
that surrounds 
us and the worlds 
within is 
a reflection 
of the Truth of God. 
Absolute 
Beingness 
is, above all,  the Divine 
Common 
Selfhood, 
that is to say, Super-conscious 
Self-awareness 
of the 
Whole.  All 
Beings 
within 
Absolute 
Beingness 
are  logoi 
expressing 
this Divine 
Selfhood 
as gods within God. 

26 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Love, Light and Life  belong 
to  the  primary Nature of 
Absolute Beingness. The Love of God is universal, 
ceaseless, 
1
mpersonal 
and unconditional. It is the Love of God, expressed 
as Grace, which lies at the core of Creation. 
The Light 
is pure, 
luminous Self-consciousness 
which 
lives in the centre 
of every 
Being. 
Everlasting 
Life is the eternal 
motion, generation and 
regeneration of expression. 
Other characteristics of Absolute _Beingness include Multi­
plicity, Self-sufficiency and the Will-pleasure 
to express Itself 
in Itself as Creation. 
We know of Absolute 
Beingness that It is multiple 
in Its 
Unity. 
Within Absolute 
Beingness, in both the expressed and 
unexpressed condition, are  the  Christ Logos 
and  the  Holy 
Spirit, 'and these 
three are one', 
writes 
the apostle Y ohannan 
(1  John 5:7). Also composing the Multiplicity of  Absolute 
Beingness are myriad upon myriad 
of Self-conscious logoic 
Beings. 
Humanity, 
the  Archangelic Orders, and  other Self­
aware Beings 
are Holy 
Monads within the timeless 
body of 
God. 
The  Self-sufficiency of  Absolute Beingness inspired 
Meister Eckhart to write, 'Outside 
of God, there is nothing but 
nothing.' 
The Omnipresence of Absolute Beingness engenders 
everything, embraces all, and all will be in the 'restitution of all 
things' (Acts 3:21). 
There is nothing that God is in need of. 
In  our  struggle 
to  comprehend the  Will-pleasure 
of 
Absolute Be-ness we learn 
that the genesis of Creation takes 
place in  a  Divine 
Meditation where God  contemplates the 
Divine Plan that becomes Creation. The Will-pleasure 
of God 
is a gem-like 
prism through 
which the Great Light shines giving 
us the colours of the Archangelic Orders. According to  the 
Will-pleasure, 
Omnipotence, Omniscience 
and  Love of 
THE ESOTERIC TEACHINGS 
27 
Absolute 
Beingness, 
this Divine 
Plan unfolds, is unfolding and 
will always unfold in the Eternal Now. 
The universes, as the texture of God, pour forth in Space 
(a Nature of God). The Logos, Holy Spirit and the Holy Arch­
angels build and maintain these universes. 
In our system we 
acknowledge seven heavens 
in which higher 
aspects of human 
consciousness can study and live in Self-awareness. There 
may 
well  be  more. w·e call  the  less  tangible 
heavens the  causal 
planes as they give definition and order to the more 
material 
universes. The Causes, Principles, Laws and Ideas 
of Creation 
exist here  in their  archetypal 
state 
cared for by  the  highest 
orders 
of the Archangels. 
The causal planes give rise to the noetic state. 
Here we 
have discernible forms in juxtaposition to one another, as yet 
unexpressed, in  perfect harmony and  order. More advanced 
human beings can begin to perceive 
structure in the noetic 
state. 
Following the noetic state, stepping down the vibrations 
of Mind, we begin to experience the worlds of separation 
as the 
noetical world 
takes shape. 
In the noetical world 
we have, for 
the first time, 
realized forms in a space-place-time 
environ­
ment (although quite different from the  conditions 
we  are 
accustomed to in the gross 
material world). The noetical world 
is the world of thought and is typified by seven planes, each 
plane further divided into seven sub-planes. 
Next, 
at a lower 
state of vibration, 
we have the emotional 
or so-called psychical world. This universe is also divided into 
seven planes and seven sub-planes. We  all experience these 
planes each  night in  our  dream 
state, or self-consciously in 
exosomatosis. 
As in the noetical planes, 
the colours 
in the psy­
chical world cover a much broader 
spectrum than on the gross 

28 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
material plane, and experiences of time and distance become 
more elastic. 
Where we read in the Old Testament that God laboured 
for six days to create the material plane ( cf. Gen. 1 :.1-31) we 
should 
understand that each day represents an epoch. The 
formation of the gross material world, the densest of  the uni­
verses, took many millennia before becoming a fitting home, 
indeed a glorious paradise, for the expression of forms. 
The three worlds of  existence co-exist, one within the 
other, as do our three bodies. The gross material world is con­
�tructed of Mind etheric vitality, ranging in frequencies, let us 
say, between 1 and 10. If 1 is etheric vitality in its densest state 
as  solid matter, 10 would be the more gaseous expressions. 
Mind as substance composes the psychical worlds and vibrates 
at frequencies 11 to 20. Mind as Super-substance, at frequen­
cies 
of 21 to 30, constitutes the noetical worlds. The properties 
of  each world, and of our bodies, are identical in  nature; 
Super-substance, substance and etheric vitality, each express 
the four elements (fire, water, earth and air) and the various 
ethers (sensate, kinetic, creative and imprint), differing only in 
frequency. The more ethereal worlds are overlaid and 
intertwined with the gross material world and 'doors' to self­
conscious movement within these worlds open as  a  result of 
sincere training. 
The 
universes and all existences are constructed of Mind. 
Mind emanates from Absolute Beingness and all Self-aware 
Beings 
for the fulfilment of  the Divine Plan. Mind is  not 
Divine, but is holy as it is used eternally and is imbued with the 
goodness and purity of God. Mind is not itself a god, or Being, 
and is not therefore an  immortal part of God. Mind's nature, 
then, is to serve the Will-pleasure of God. 
A  Spirit-Soul-Ego, in  expression, 'finds pasture' in  the 
THE ESOTERIC TEACHINGS 
29 
Kingdom of  heavens, and it  will 'go in  and out', moving 
between the universes, incarnating and reincarnating (cf. John 
10:9). 
The Archangels of the Elements 
And the Angel said unto them, Fear not: 
for, behold, I bring you good tidings of  great joy, 
which shall be to all people. 
Luke 2:10 
He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: 
And in their hands they shall bear thee up, 
lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
Luke 4:10,11 
The Archangels are logoic and Holy Spiritual Beings, who 
build, govern over and project themselves into the universes. 
Within Absolute Beingness are Orders of  Archangels, Holy 
Monadic Beings, each Order containing myriad upon myriad 
of Beings of the same type. 
We know of the existence of twelve Archangelic Orders: 
Thrones, Authorities, Dominions, Principalities, Overlords, 
Seraphims and �herubims, along with others, named and 
unnamed. 
No one has ever spoken in detail of the kind of vibrations 
of  the Archangels who belong to  the higher echelons of  the 
Orders. Few have come close enough to these Orders to attune 
to  them. Human language, in any case, proves inadequate to 
describe their splendour. 
When a human being descends into the worlds of separa­
tion, an Archangel from the Thrones accompanies him as his 
Guardian Archangel. Even if we are unaware of his presence, 

30 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
our Guardian Archangel, with whom we are egofied, is always 
caring for us. 
These 
Archangels appear in  all religions, Eastern and 
Western, and in  the majority of theosophic and esoteric sys­
tems, as messiahs, messengers, demigods, devas and the like. 
The Archangels are familiar to the Buddhists, Hindus, Aztecs 
and Ancient Egyptians. They vary in  form and in  name, but 
their duties, responsibilities and forces are universal and iden­
tical. 
The 
Archangels of the elements concern us in our research 
and meditations as  they are most intimately involved in  our 
well-being and advancement. Their names are not of  human 
origin, but rather the resonance of each Order's vibration. 
First there is the order of the 'Michaels' -Ma-Ha-El, 'The 
Great God'. In Sanskrit Maha means 'great' and El stands f
o
r 
God (as it does also in Ancient Egyptian and Hebrew). Appro­
priately 
we find the suffix El in  all the Archangelic names. 
Michael's 
light is red, in all its shades, and he is the Archangel 
of light and fire. 
Then there is the Archangel 'Gabriel', or in the ancient 
Egyptian pronunciation, Kha-Vir-El. Ga or Kha denotes desire, 
sentiment, 
and expressed love. Bir or  Vir indicates element. 
Gabriel's light is sky-blue in many different shades, and he is 
the ruler of water and the liquids, which constitute three quar­
ters of the planet. Gabriel is the steward of the entire physical 
kingdom. 
Let us next mention 'Raphael' - Ra-Fa-El. In  ancient 
Egyptian Ra  stands for the sun, and Fa,  f
o
r  vibration: 
'Sun-vibration-God'. Raphael, the Archangel of energy, is 
characterized by the shades of violet. This colour derives from 
the mixture of red (Michael) and blue (Gabriel), and thus tallies 
THE ESOTERIC TEACHINGS 
31 
with the role of Raphael as fellow-worker with the other two. 
The planet in  its entirety is  within Raphael's domain, who 
controls the electromagnetic forces - etheric vitality, as we call 
it. 
Another Archangel, who coordinates the work of all the 
Archangels within the gross material body, is  'Uriel' - U-Ra­
El, as known to our Egyptian forefathers. U stands for space 
and 
Ra for the sun: 'Space-Sun-God'. The great harmonizer of 
substance, Uriel keeps the universal Law of Order and Harmony, 
both within and between each body. The colour which repre­
sents Uriel is silvery-white. 
The phenomenon of life in al,l the kingdoms is the work 
of the Archangels of the elements. 
When a human being first incarnates into the lower worlds 
it does so with one Archangel from each Order of the elements. 
Thus, 
within the bodies of  every human being there work a 
Michael, a Gabriel, a Raphael, a Uriel and a Shamael. Shamael, 
who is the angel of earth, is the elemental projection of Lucifer, 
the Archangel of light and keeper of duality. Shamael is  not 
himself an Archangel. 
Let us now look at the way they serve our material body. 
As the angel of earth and minerals, and in everlasting coopera­
tion with the Archangels, Shamael provides us with the material 
for our bones, our muscles and the organs of the body. Michael 
gives us bodily warmth and rich red blood. Gabriel gives us the 
body's various fluids. Raphael provides our etheric vitality and 
plays an invaluable role in maintaining our health. During the 
night these Archangels work in  our resting bodies to  enact 
repairs towards good health. 
Corresponding to their immaculate labours in our material 

32 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
body the Archangels also help build and maintain our psychical 
and noetical bodies and their respective etheric doubles. They 
work in a similar manner throughout all the universes. 
We  must  learn  to  work  self-consciously with  the 
Archangels of the elements in the maintenance of health and 
well-being, and also to consciously benefit from their wisdom 
and  love.  Exercises and  meditations will  help  us  develop 
awareness of the Archangelic Orders. 
On Being Human 
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. 
Genesis 1 :26 
Ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 
2 Corinthians 6:18 
Prior  to  passing through the  Human Idea,  humanity is  an 
Archangel within the Archangelic Orders. Before their expres­
sion, Human Beings and Archangels, as Holy Monads, differ 
little from each other. Later, however, when they return to be 
within Absolute Beingness, the difference is great. Archangels 
cannot obtain Super Self-consciousness in any of their expres­
sions. This is because they have their Being within the Eternal 
Now and are exposed to various experiences without being able 
to make comparisons. An Archangel of fire, for example, uses 
this element with Total Wisdom, but does not know the emo­
tions and thoughts which are aroused by the presence of the 
element. Conversely, human beings, as Prodigal Children (cf. 
Luke 15:11-32), are fully exposed to the worlds of duality, of 
space-place-time impressions, and are therefore able to devel­
op a keen sense of individuated Self-consciousness. Such con­
siderations inspired Paramahansa Y ogananda to  say,  'The 
THE ESOTERIC TEACHINGS 
33 
human form is higher than the angel form. Man is the highest 
being in Creation because he aspires to freedom.' 
After passing through the Idea of Archangelic Man, a ray 
of the Spirit then continues through the Idea of Heavenly man 
to be shaped according to the law of the Human Idea. From that 
moment it takes on its own separate radiance within Absolute 
Beingness. A small ray of our Spirit-Ego-Being enters into a 
separate domain of Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total Love 
as a Self-aware Soul. Now we have two foundations for the 
Inner Self: the Holy Monadic Self within Absolute Beingness 
and Its emanation which passes through the Heavenly Man to 
be 
formed into the Self-aware Soul. Here we see how our Holy 
Monadic Self takes on a separate existence from that of the 
Archangels. 
The  Self-aware Soul,  which is  formed of  Spirit, then 
begins to express Itself. As the Soul is of incorruptible Spirit, it 
is Self-sufficient and Omniscient. All Souls are equally lumi­
nous. The Soul can never be harmed or weakened in any way, 
so 'fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the 
soul' (Matt. 10:28). It is the Soul which distinguishes humans 
from other Beings, for Archangels have no need of a Soul as 
they each belong to a communal Order. It is the Soul that har­
bours the Divine Individuation of each human Spirit-Soul-Ego 
when we return to our Father. The Soul is the womb of Super 
Self-consciousness. 
As  the  Spirit-Ego-Being gives  birth  to the  Self-aware 
Soul, the Soul gives life to Its own projection. This projection 
is what we call our Permanent Personality. Descending into the 
worlds of experience, it takes on its own colour and designs its 
own projections. As long as it remains in the worlds of space­
place-time, it assumes many names, dons many present-day

Individuated 
Selfhood 
Even though you tie a hundred knots 
-
the string remains one. 
Rumi 
No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, 
neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, 
that they which come in may see the light. 
Luke 11:33 
Corresponding 
to the 
seven 
universes 
of 
Creation 
are the 
veils 
which 
dress 
the 
Spirit-Soul-Ego 
during 
its 
sojourn. 
Further 
investigation 
suggests 
that 
the 
human 
form 
does 
not 
so 
much 
contain 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heavens, 
but 
rather 
is 
the 
kingdom 
of 
heavens. 
When 
you 
realize 
this 
you 
understand 
that 
the 
traveller 
is the 
journey, the 
seeker 
is the 
sought. 
And 
when 
you 
seek 
this 
kingdom 
all 
'things 
shall 
be 
added 
unto 
you' 
(Luke 
12:31). 
Human 
beings 
in 
their 
highest 
states 
express 
the 
Divine 
Love, 
Causes, 
Principles 
and 
Laws 
of 
Creation. 
In 
the 
lower, 
more 
dense 
states, 
as 
bodies, 
they 
express 
thought 
(noetical) 
and 
emotion 
(psychical) 
in the 
worlds 
of 
separation. 
Our 
gross 
material 
body, 
such 
a  small 
portion 
of 
the 
Selfhood, 
and 
yet 
often 
mistaken 
for 
the 
self, 
belongs 
to the material 
plane. 
Our 
psychical 
and 
noetical 
bodies 
are 
given 
us 
as 
amor­
phous 
masses 
which 
we 
must 
sculpt 
into 
refined 
and 
cleansed 
vehicles 
through 
which 
we 
can 
live 
unencumbered. 
Most 
of us 
allow 
our 
emotions 
and 
beliefs 
to rule over 
our 
personality, 
but 
it 
is 
the 
personality 
that 
must 
dictate 
the 
composition 
of 
its 
psychical 
and 
noetical 
bodies. 
As 
St. 
Paul 
reminds 
us, 
'Hath 
not 
the 
potter 
power 
over 
the 
clay?' 
(Rom. 
9:21). 
After 
passing-over 
from 
the 
material 
plane 
we 
shall 
continue 
to 
live 
in 
the 
psychical 
world 
and, 
later 
on, 
in 
the 
THE ESOTERIC 
TEACHINGS 
35 
noetical 
world 
before 
reincarnating 
on 
the 
gross 
material 
plane. 
Entrenched, 
encaged, 
in 
a petty 
present-day 
personality, 
most 
of 
us 
will 
fail 
to realize 
that 
we 
have 
crossed 
over 
to the 
other 
side, 
and 
will 
continue 
to live 
in the 
same 
restrictive 
manner 
as 
on 
earth. 
The 
work 
of 
self-consciously 
constructing 
our 
psy­
chical 
and 
noetical 
expressions 
rewards 
us 
now 
and 
in 
the 
hereafter. 
'Verily 
I say 
unto 
you,' 
warns 
Joshua, 
'Whatsoever 
ye 
shall 
bind 
on 
earth 
shall 
be 
bound 
in heaven: 
and 
whatsoever 
ye 
shall 
loose 
on 
earth 
shall 
be 
loosed 
in 
heaven' 
(Matt. 
18:18). 
The 
Selfhood 
of .each 
of 
us 
extends 
from 
our 
Self 
as 
a 
Spirit-Ego-Being 
(our 
unexpressed 
Holy 
Monad 
Self) 
as 
it 
remains 
in 
at-one-ment 
with 
Absolute 
Beingness, 
and 
reaches 
down 
to the 
often 
struggling 
present-day 
personality. 
For 
those 
who 
wonder 
whether 
it was 
our 
choice 
to leave 
home 
we 
sug­
gest 
a  reading 
of 
the 
Parable 
of 
the 
Prodj;gal 
Son 
(Luke 
15: 
11-32) 
which details 
the 
decision 
on 
the 
part 
of the 
Son 
to 
leave
his 
father's 
home. 
This 
is where 
free 
will 
is 
established.
The 
central 
task 
of 
each 
Soul 
is to reunify 
the 
self 
- after 
its 
enrichment 
through 
the 
cycles 
of 
incarnations 
- into 
the 
unified 
Self 
in Theosis. 
The 
Individuated 
Selfhood, 
accounting 
for 
the 
various 
expressions, 
is in the 
'image' 
and 
'likeness' 
(cf. 
Gen. 
1:26) 
of 
Absolute 
Beingness. 
, 
Firstly, 
we 
have 
Self-sufficiency. 
As Absolute 
Beingness 
is 
without 
any 
needs, 
we 
contain 
within 
us 
everything: 
'The 
Kingdom 
of Heavens 
is within 
you.' 
We 
lack 
nothing 
and 
need 
nothing 
that 
we 
do 
not 
already 
possess. 
Secondly, 
as 
Holy 
Monads, 
we 
can 
express 
ourselves 
self-consciously 
within 
our 
own 
universe 
and 
within 
our 
own 
selfhood. 
In 
a 
similar 
way, 
macrocosmically, 
the 
Logos 

36 
THE ESOTERIC 
PRACTICE 
expresses 
Its 
Self 
within 
Its 
universes 
as  the 
Common 
Self­
hood. 
Thirdly, 
we have 
the 
power 
of shaping 
the 
Mind 
substance 
into 
thought 
and 
emotion, 
and 
of expressing ourselves 
as love. 
And 
when 
deemed 
worthy 
we 
are 
awarded 
the 
gift 
of emanat­
ing-
not 
merely 
shaping-
the 
Mind 
super-substance, 
the 
bearer 
of life. 
Fourthly, 
we 
have 
been 
blessed 
with 
the 
gift 
and 
the 
responsibility 
of procreation 
and 
of caring 
for 
other 
incarnated 
Souls. 
In this 
way 
we 
are 
co-creators 
within 
the 
Divine 
Plan, 
with 
the 
Holy 
Spirit, 
the 
Holy 
Archangels, 
and 
the 
Christ 
Logos. 
The 
Individuated 
Selfhood, 
as a single 
umbrella, 
encompasses 
four 
discernible 
expressions: 
Spirit-Ego-Being 
This 
is our 
Real 
Self, 
in at-one-ment 
with 
the 
Multiplicity 
and 
the 
Self-sufficiency 
of  Absolute 
Beingness. 
The 
Spirit-Ego­
Being 
projects 
a ray 
of Itself 
into 
Creation. 
The 
Will-pleasure 
of Absolute 
Beingness 
to express 
Itself 
in Itself, 
is identical 
to 
the 
Will-pleasure 
of the 
Spirit-Ego-Being 
to  express 
Itself 
in 
Itself. 
The 
Spirit-Ego-Being 
is  not 
properly 
considered 
an 
expression 
of  the 
Selfhood, 
rather 
it  is  a  creator 
of  the 
Self­
hood. 
Self-aware 
Soul 
We 
become 
a Self-aware 
Soul 
the 
moment 
a ray 
of the 
Spirit­
Ego-Being 
passes 
through 
the 
Human 
Idea, 
at which 
point 
we 
understand 
our 
Self 
as  something 
complete, 
yet 
seemingly 
separated 
from 
the 
Whole. 
The 
Self-aware 
Soul 
with 
its pro-
THE ESOTERIC 
TEACHINGS 
37 
jections 
is both 
Beingness 
and 
existence. 
Beingness, 
as our 
real 
nature, 
is the 
Divine 
Permanent 
Point. 
That 
of existence 
is the 
other 
end 
of the 
continuum, 
where 
it plunges 
into 
the 
worlds 
of 
experience 
and 
development. 
Permanent 
Personality 
Described 
by 
some 
as  'the 
feet 
of  the 
soul', 
this 
self 
is  an 
expression 
of, 
and 
in  union 
with, 
the 
Self-aware 
Soul 
in  the 
worlds 
of time 
and 
place. 
The 
Permanent 
Personality 
contains 
the 
Divine 
Laws, 
Total 
Wisdom, 
Total 
Power 
and 
Total 
Love. 
It  is  the 
task 
of 
the 
Permanent 
Personality 
to  select 
and 
supervise 
the 
lives 
and 
experiences 
of 
the 
present-day 
personalities. 
Through 
this 
process 
the 
Permanent 
Personality 
becomes 
fuller.
Present-day 
Personality 
This 
is the 
personality 
we 
express 
in  each 
individual 
incarna­
tion. 
It is the 
projection 
of the 
Permanent 
Personality 
into 
the 
worlds 
of separation 
and 
their 
sub-planes. 
It is that 
aspect 
of the 
Self 
which 
experiences 
emotions,  desires 
and 
thoughts, 
of 
which 
a character 
is formed. 
With 
time, 
this 
personality learns 
to interpret 
the 
impressions 
and 
correct 
its reactions, 
so that 
a 
refined 
personality 
develops. 
It is this 
expression 
of the 
self­
hood 
that 
Joshua 
asks 
us to 'deny' 
(Matt. 
16:24) 
so that 
we 
may 
better 
understand 
our 
Real 
Self. 
Let 
us sum 
up, 
so as to better 
understand 
the 
concept 
of Indi­
viduated 
Selfhood 
in its different 
expressions. 
Our 
selfhood 
is 
one, 
even 
though 
we 
meet 
it in four 
stages: 
Spirit-Ego-Being, 
Self-aware 
Soul, 
Permanent 
Personality 
and 
present-day 
per­
sonality. 
Our 
Individuated 
Selfhood, 
in its higher 
expressions, 
takes 
part 
in the 
Common 
logoic 
Selfhood.

THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
We can imagine the pure Spirit of humanity as a ray pro­
jected from  the  sun  (Absolute Beingness). This  ray  passes 
through the Idea of the Archangelic Man, continuing on to the 
Human Idea. Now picture this ray approaching an open win­
dow. 
On one side of the window we have the Self-aware Soul. 
As the ray passes through the window the Permanent Persona­
lity is shaped, part of it remaining within the Soul's home in the 
Eternal Now, and the other part expressing itself in the worlds 
of separation. The ray continues beyond the window and hits 
the 
floor. Here we have what we term our present-day person­
ality. The floor, where the pattern of the Spirit Soul is laid, 
should be kept clean and swept. 
The 
light from its source is pure and luminous. Filtered 
down through Ideas, universes, and layers of the Selfhood, it 
remains the  same  light,  only diffused. It is as if numerous 
lampshades had been placed over a bright bulb. Exercises and 
meditations, coupled with sound theoretical underfootings, can 
do much to clean these shades, help us draw nearer to the source 
of the Light, 
and allow the Light from above to reflect more 
fully within our personalities. 'If thy whole body therefore be 
full oflight, having no part dark, the whole shall be full oflight, 
as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light' 
(Luke 11 :36).  Therefore 'Let your light so shine before men, 
that 
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father 
which is in heaven' (Matthew 5:16). 
SOME COMMON QUESTIONS 
What is the best time of day to engage in this work? 
Any time you feel most comfortable. We would only say that at 
sunrise etheric vitality abounds and exercising at this time can 
be beneficial. Conversely it  is  prudent to  avoid meditation 
during sunset when many  harmful energies are  active. We 
recommend the practice of one exercise in the morning, com­
plemented by engaging in another in the evening. If you find 
time at midday to do  a short  exercise so  much the better. 
Depending on your individual focus choose which line of work 
you wish to pursue during these periods. After nightfall we 
advise against the practice of exercise beyond daily introspec­
tion.  Daily  introspection, the  most  valued exercise, is  best 
practised when preparing for sleep. 
Is routine valuable? 
Commitment is a necessity, but we never ask any of you to 
meditate when you are not inclined to: nothing good will come 
of that. You cannot force this work on yourself. If it is possible 
and you feel comfortable with it, try to exercise at least once a 
day.  Wh
�
t is most vital is that you  allow and preserve for
yourself some time in your daily life. Certain exercises require 

40 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
daily 
practice to  properly succeed (e.g. developing etheric 
hands, 
light balls, daily introspection). 
Does 
fasting 
help to concentrate? 
Joshua 
said, 
'Not 
that which 
goeth 
into the mouth defileth 
a 
man; but that which 
cometh out of  the mouth, this defileth a 
man' 
[Matt.15:11]. On the other 
hand a full 
belly can be quite 
a 
distraction. We are neither for asceticism nor over­
indulgence. 
Is 
it better 
to sit in a chair, cross-legged on the floor, 
or in some 
other position? 
Find 
whatever position makes you most 
comfortable: in  a 
chair, on the floor, or even 
lying on a bed. Remember the Soul 
is 
always in a state of worship and reverence. 
Try 
to relax your 
body 
in  whatever position suits you for productive work. As 
much as possible, 
and without discomforting 
yourself, try and 
keep your spine straight to assure the proper 
flow of energy. 
In a few of the longer exercises 
I have 
difficulties 
remember
ing 
the sequence. Have you any advice? 
This 
is understandable. If you 
feel comfortable 
with your own 
voice, 
or with 
that 
of a friend, 
try recording 
the longer 
medi­
tations on tape, or have them 
recited to you. 
Should 
there be silence in the room, or does music help? 
As 
you like. 
Music, as long as it has 
a calming effect on the 
psychical body, is  a  nice device to measure and mark move­
ments 
within 
a  meditation. 
Quiet 
instrumentals prove to 
enhance meditations for many. 
How can I gauge 
when to move on to more complex work? 
You will know when it is time. 
Remember, 
this work takes 
time, 
SOME COMMON 
QUESTIONS 
41 
much time and patience, so do not 
expect great results early 
on. 
A good measure of  your readiness to move on  is the level 
of 
success at each stage. Master each stage as you go along and 
do not be in a hurry. Your 
Guardian Archangel 
will always be 
there 
to assist you in your work and 
will encourage you when 
it is time 
to move 
ahead. 
I would like to know 
what exercises 
are good 
for children to 
practise and at what age they should 
begin. 
Children come into 
this 
world with distinct personalities, gifts 
and directions. This, coupled with the extent 
to which 
parents 
and a  culture 
encourage or  limit the child, determines 
the 
degree to which the child is inclined 
towards meditation. Some 
children are 
more 
introspective, while others are 
extroverted. 
We have to remember that 
we are 
more 
clairvoyant when we 
are 
young 
and 
are more 
in  touch 
with the greater 
order of 
things. This enables youth to enjoy heightened states in medi­
tation. 
Children 
are also 
in  closer 
communication with 
the 
Guardian Archangels 
and 
guiding spirits, and through 
medi­
tation they can keep this vital communication open as they 
grow older 
and 
more involved in the 
world. All types of exer­
cises and meditations are suitable 
for children, yet we 
must 
never require 
our children 
to meditate. It has to be their 
wish. 
If someone is burdened with great 
confusion is it advisable 
that 
they should meditate to sort matters 
out? 
If  a friend 
or  someone you know is  in  a  state of  internal 
upheaval we strongly advise against any exercise. For someone 
battling with 
psychical 
turmoil the etheric energy centres need 
calming and balancing. We 
have to  be  in  control 
when we 
exercise lest we do further damage. Prayer, 
and a basic 
exer­
cise of flooding oneself in white light, are the best approaches 

42 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
for restoring order. Friends and family can be of great help to 
those in crisis, with their prayers and by sending balls of white 
light. 
How can I differentiate between actual psycho-noetical forms 
and those which I imagine? 
We must be vigilant against imagination inte1fering with our 
work. Psycho-noetical forms are real and will continue to live 
after a material form is dissolved. We have holy authority to 
create psycho-noetical images, but not forms. We can only 
invoke the Divine forms. In our visualizations we reflect Abso­
lute Beingness' work, and should not allow ourselves to  be 
overrun by our fantasies. When we work we must shape ele­
mentals and fill them with the appropriate ethers. In time, as 
we grow more able, these shapes will be filled with the help of 
the Archangels and become faithful to the universal forms. 
I am having difficulties separating times when I am experienc­
ing my psychical body from times when I am working with my 
noetical body. How can I tell the difference? 
Intoxicated by matter, humanity is  only able to see things in 
material 
terms when, in fact, our psychical and noetical bodies 
have greater realities-far.greater-than the material body,for 
'it  is  the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing' 
[John 6:63]. All of us can determine when we are motivated by 
a desire or an emotion from the times when we are guided by 
an idea or  an  ideal. These are our separate bodies voicing 
themselves through the personality. Learn to hear their voices 
(i.e. elementals) and it will soon become clear that each body 
is distinct with specific needs and purposes. 
In many exercises we are asked to 'raise or lower our vibrations 
to different levels'. Could you explain how this is done? 
SOME COMMON QUESTIONS 
43 
Every 
form owns a vibratory pattern which regulates its exis­
tence. In  order to  come in  contact with specific forms it  is 
necessary to  adjust our vibration to  correspond to  the f
r
e­
quency we  desire to come in contact with. Often this means 
lifting ourselves up to Divine energy, while at other times it may 
mean gauging our rhythms to 'lower', less complex forms of life 
(e.g. flowers,f
r
uits, birds, etc.). 
This is  something that has to  be  experienced. During a 
meditation you slowly rid yourself of heavy emotions and way­
ward ideas. As water reaches a boil at a certain temperature, 
so 
we can learn to let go of the lower self during a meditation 
in  an  effort to  reach higher states. When the time comes to 
return to our present-day personality (i.e. lower our vibrations) 
we learn to recompose ourselves. 

PART TWO 
PRACTICE 
EXERCISES AND MEDITATIONS 

ON  PATTERNED BREATHING 
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, 
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. 
Genesis 2:7 
From the  moment we  are  born into the  world we  breathe. 
Breathing is  basic to  life.  Along with food, rest, sleep, and 
sunshine, breathing is a major source of etheric vitality neces­
sary for the generation and regeneration of a healthy life. 
Yet  as  basic as  breathing is to  good health, few  of us 
overcome our instinctive pattern of breathing (indeed, we often 
corrupt it) to gain self-conscious control over the work of our 
lungs. The fact  is,  most of us breathe poorly and our health 
suffers as a result. 
Breathing exercises abound, some good, some harmful. 
We must use the utmost caution when we decide to interfere 
with our breathing -for the manner in which we breathe affects 
every other aspect of our physiology and psychical well-being. 
We find that many Eastern techniques of breathing can have 
detrimental effects on  the  minds and  bodies of Westerners, 
crippling their nervous systems by prematurely exciting their 
etheric energy centres. 

48 
THE  ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Our recommended system of breathing is both safe and 
effective, having been practised over the  millennia in  many 
traditions. Every exercise and meditation to follow will benefit 
from patterned breathing. When breathing systematically you 
free the mind of the bodies' discomforts and charge the medi­
tational process with focused energy. You will soon find that 
patterned breathing will begin to  enter your non-meditative 
states. By breathing properly you will enjoy increased stores of 
etheric vitality for your own health and to share with others in 
need. 
ON PATTERNED BREATHING 
Basic Breathing Technique 
Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. 
Psalms 150:6 
49 
Begin by relaxing as much as possible. Forget the weights of 
yesterday, today and any thought of tomorrow. Free mind and 
body from any activity. Breathe in a calm and patterned man­
ner: one full inhalation followed by a full outbreath. 
Now inhale, through your nostrils, a  breath measuring 
three counts of the heart. On the first count fill your abdomen, 
on the second fill the torso's midsection and with the last count 
inflate your chest fully. Immediately begin to release the breath, 
through your mouth, starting with your abdomen and moving 
upwards with each beat of the heart until your lungs are emp­
tied. Repeat this for  a  few minutes daily until it  becomes 
effortless and natural. 
Once you feel comfortable with the 3:3 count, try a count 
of 4:4 by dividing the torso into four parts, always filling the 
abdomen first and the chest last; then releasing the lowest sec­
tion first and the chest cavity last. 
In time, as your lungs grow accustomed to the work, you 
may want to try a six count, i.e. six in, six out. Later you may 
try seven or eight counts. Each of us will find a count that suits 
us. Please avoid a count of five as this can have adverse psychic 
effects. 
Patterned breathing is not so much an exercise in itself as 
the foundation for most exercises. The Archangels, who help 
regulate your body's health, will rejoice as  you gain greater 
conscious control over your breathing. 

OBSERVATION, CONCENTRATION 
AND  VISUALIZATION 
Whoso is wise, and will observe these  things, even they shall 
understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. 
Psalms 107:43 
Perhaps the most important skill for performing an exercise is 
the ability to form psycho-noetical images and scenes. This 
work  is  otherwise known as  visualization. Psycho-noetical 
images are elementals constructed of Mind super-substance at 
varying rates of frequency. Once created, an image has a real, 
multi-dimensional existence that is far more durable than any 
gross material object. 
We 
must  not  confuse this  holy  work  with  fantasy. In 
shaping substance (using kinetic, creative, imprint and sensate 
ethers) we seek to replicate the work of the Logos and the Holy 
Spirit by faithfully reproducing noetic forms. Visualization is 
used as a vehicle to expand our consciousness, as it is the lan­
guage between the mundane and the Divine. By constructing 
specific forms and settings we allow for interaction with Divine 
energies. Visualization, additionally, is indispensable in heal­
ing work for invoking images of health and perfection where 
illness and disease have set in. 

52 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Archangels are  constantly creating such  images, in 
accordance with the Divine forms, when they shape universes 
and worlds, and when they form angels to watch over their 
work. Our ability to form these images is a most Divine gift and 
privilege that we need to fully develop with reverence. 
OBSERVATION, CONCENTRATION & VISUALIZATION 
53 
Drawing and Visualization 
A good way to start with the creation of psycho-noetical images 
is to take some simple household object and study it in great 
detail over a series of days. Observe its contour, texture, weight 
and colour with full and unfailing attention. 
Now, whether you can draw properly or not, take a pad of 
paper and a pencil and, with the object in hand, do your best to 
make faithful and detailed drawings. With each drawing you'll 
find you are able to add more and more detail. 
After drawing the object over a series of days place it out 
of sight and draw it from memory. Slowly, but surely, in time 
the image that is ingrained in your memory (by use of imprint 
ether) will pour out on the paper in detail. 
The next day, or the next week, draw again the object 
from memory and you'll find that it hasn't diminished but 
remains a vivid elemental within your subconscious. Stored in 
your memory are thousands of living three-dimensional forms 
that you can recall at any time. 

54 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
A Lemon 
Practise the preceding exercise with a  lemon. Spend several 
days 
drawing an actual lemon, and a couple of days drawing it 
from memory until you know well its outer form. 
Take a lemon and tum it in your hand. How heavy is it? 
Feel its texture, scratch the skin and inhale its rich fragrance. 
Notice the hundreds of pores on the rind. What 
does it feel like? 
Cut a slice out of the lemon. A little oil comes from the rind. 
Juice runs over your hand from the succulent pulp. Squeeze a 
few drops into your mouth and taste its sharp, tangy flavour. 
Clean your hands, sit and relax. Bring to mind a whole 
lemon. Visualize it in your etheric hand with your eyes closed. 
Tum it before your etheric eyes. It is very much like the lemon 
you 
just held. You can feel its weight and the waxy texture. 
Notice 
how the lemon is not fully yellow as it has lime-green 
colour on the crown. 
Cut into your visualized lemon. See the glistening pulp. 
You 
can feel the oil from the rind on  your fingers. Take the 
lemon 
to your mouth and squeeze a few droplets. Perhaps you 
will 
find yourself squinting your eyes for  fear they may be 
sprayed. The sour taste makes your mouth pucker. With all 
your 
senses - your inner senses - you are experiencing this 
psycho-noetical lemon. 
Try another fruit the next week and as you grow more able 
to faithfully reproduce forms you will enjoy the development 
of  your inner senses. 
OBSERVATION, CONCENTRATION & VISUALIZATION 
A Rose 
Still, in a way, nobody sees a flower really, it is so small, 
we 
haven't time, and to see takes time 
like to have afriend takes time. 
Georgia O'Keefe 
55 
Hold in  your hand an  actual red rose. Study this rose very 
closely: its shape, size, and colour. Tum it before your eyes and 
consider it in full detail. The petals are soft as velvet with rich 
shades of deep crimson. The stem that you clutch is stiff and 
coarse in  comparison. Your fingers avoid the  many thorns. 
Bring the flower to your nose and take a deep breath of its deli­
cate scent. If the rose has been in blossom for a few days, you 
. can pull back some of  the  layers of petals and peer into the 
centre. See the stamens coated with yellow pollen as they dance 
about well protected. See the extraordinary beauty of a rose. 
Set the rose aside, close your eyes and inhale deeply. Now 
visualize a rose in your etheric hand. You are using imprint 
ether to see and sensate ether to feel. Tum the flower before 
you. What do you see? You can see the rich green petals. The 
calyxes curve under the rose. You feel the stalk in your hand. 
You can even feel a prick from the thorns. See the patterned 
veins on the thick waxy leaves. Run your finger along the ser­
rated edges. Bring the  rose to your nose and breathe in  the 
fragrance. The petals tickle you as you once again enjoy the 
smell. Peer into the open flower and see the delicate stamens. 
Decide to change the colour of the rose. See the petals tum 
from red to white. Slowly the colour shifts until you have a pure 
white rose. Using imprint ether it is easy to change the colour 
of your rose. Tum it to yellow and then back to red. 

56 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Study  the  rose  for  a  few  minutes and  then  visualize 
someone 
with whom you may have had a quarrel. Offer your 
psycho-noetical rose to him with love and peace. 
There 
is so much to see and feel with the Divine gift of 
inner sight. 
OBSERVATION, CONCENTRATION & VISUALIZATION
Doves 
57 
Let 
us all draw upon what we have  within us,  as  thought, 
knowledge, and form. We are all familiar with doves: their size, 
shape, colour and weight. In this exercise we will first visualize 
and then animate a dove. 
Relax and breathe deeply. Visualize in your right etheric 
hand a dove made of white plaster. Notice its shape. The plaster 
is cool. Place your left hand on the dove. You can feel the tex­
ture 
of its feathers. They are not soft as are real feathers. Scratch 
the 
dove a little with your fingernail. It is static because there is 
no Mind-life as kinetic ether in a plaster dove. Let it fall from 
your hands and watch as it shatters into pieces on the floor. 
Hold out your right etheric arm and visualize a white dove 
as it lands on your hand. This dove looks much the same as the 
plaster dove, but it is filled with life. She trembles as she bal­
ances on your hand. Her rose-coloured claws dig slightly into 
your 
skin, but it doesn't hurt. Her finely carved beak has a yel­
low hue. 
Gently place your left hand on the dove. Through her 
chest feathers you feel her heart flutter. She stirs as you stroke 
her silky feathers, but she likes your touch. She softly coos. 
Unlike the plaster dove this form has been filled with Mind-life. 
Caress her head with your index finger. Notice her dark round 
eyes 
blink as she moves her head. Fill your dove with love. 
Shake your hand and the bird takes flight. She doesn't fall 

58 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
to the ground as the plaster one did, but rises up and inscribes 
a beautiful circle in the air, before she returns to you. Caress her 
and 
send her once more up in the air to circle about and have 
her alight again on your hand. With love let her go. 
This dove will exist forever as an  elemental. Whenever 
you wish you can call her back to your hand, and even create 
another dove for her to play with. 
OBSERVATION, CONCENTRATION & VISUALIZATION
A Pastoral Landscape 
Within you there is a stillness and sanctuary to 
which you can retreat at any time and be yourself 
Hermann Hesse 
59 
Breathe in a patterned manner and relax completely. Visualize 
yourself 
sitting near a meadow on a beautiful spring afternoon. 
Create 
in your etheric hands a  small swallow and allow it  to 
take 
flight. Watch it as it flutters over the meadow and settles 
on a branch of an apple tree covered with delicate young blos­
soms. 
See in  the distance, against the deep blue sky, a  large 
ivory-white eagle soar through the air. The eagle dips and rises 
with just a tip of his wings. He is riding the air currents. 
Now study the rich meadow before you. Many are the 
smells 
re-emerging after a long winter. The thawing ground is 
moist and the air is still cool. See a cow grazing down near a 
pond. She is  enjoying the new grass after eating dry hay all 
winter. What colour is this cow? Brown and white? Black? You 
decide. 
You can trace a  small brook flowing out of  the pond. 
Dragonflies dart about the rain-swollen stream. What a lovely, 
calming sound running water makes. 
Up on the far side of  the pond is  a  flock of  sheep and 
lambs.  Count them. How many are there? A shepherd watches 
over his flock. He is leaning on a crook enjoying the warm sun 
as his sheepdog sits beside him. You can hear the bells of the 

60 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
sheep ring  as they move through the  grass. There are  baby 
lambs bleating as they skip and play with one another. 
Now stroll into this meadow. Yellow daffodils are scat­
tered here and there. Move where you wish. Your swallow is 
flying about and lands near the pond. The eagle soars overhead 
and 
the sheep startle slightly as they see you approach. Notice 
how the soft ground sinks in as you take each step. Feel mois­
ture soak into your shoes. The air is damp and fresh. The cow 
stares at you for a second and then continues to eat. Go up to 
her and feel her soft coat.  She likes it when you scratch her 
behind the ears. 
After a while return to where you began and look over 
your meadow. You see serenity and harmony everywhere. This 
is 
a centre of calm and peace which you can visit and take sol­
ace. Wish the harmony and peace of this meadow to spread 
over the material plane. 
OBSERVATION, CONCENTRATION & VISUALIZATION 
Concentration and Observation 
And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch. 
Mark 13:37 
61 
Observation is an aspect of our Divine nature. Observation and 
concentration make us both human and gods, as we can probe 
the outer and inward worlds deftly and gracefully. It is through 
observation that we are able to expand our conscious awareness 
to  endless heights. In  increasing our  awareness and  under­
standing of our surroundings, becoming keenly aware of all the 
nuances, we will move out of the small shells of our personali­
ties and into the larger truths. There are no limits to how far we 
can extend our comprehension of the Divine Plan when we 
develop our ability to concentrate and observe. 
The more aware we become of the world which surrounds 
us now, the more conscious we will be in the worlds beyond. 
This applies equally to our nightly visits (exosomatosis) to the 
other planes, as it does to when we eventually pass-over from 
the  material plane into  the  more refined worlds. Through 
enhanced observation comes an ability to see beyond apparent 
limitations and to control the course of our experiences in the 
psychical and  noetical worlds. The  following exercise is 
instrumental in awakening and tuning our ability to be percep­
tive and alert. 
Choose a site either within your home or in the environs that 
surround your home: your livingroom, a garden, a park, or a 
meadow. Select a time when you will be alone in peace. Sit 
calmly for some time, say five minutes, breathing on a pat­
terned 4:4 count. When you feel your senses in a heightened 
state, stand up and begin to move very slowly about the area. 

62 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
You are observing every detail: the colours, the sizes, and 
the smells of all the objects that surround you. You see each 
item iri relation to every other. For fifteen minutes you move 
about absorbing as much as you possibly can. Return to where 
you began. Repeat this for a few days, each time learning more 
and more of the area of research. 
When you feel familiar with the setting, after your fifteen 
minute walk of  observation, return to  where you began and 
relax. Now, in your thoughts - using imprint and sensate ethers 
- try to visualize all that you have just seen. You have 
been
studying this setting now for many days and it is easy for you
to  recall it.  Recreate every detail: the textures, the smells,
sounds and the sensations. You can see the colours of every­
thing. You see it all just as you did a few minutes 
ago.
Set out again the next day and see what you failed to 
notice on the previous days.  You  are beginning to  observe 
more, much more. Settle back in a chair and again recreate the 
setting. You notice that imprint ether has stored much of the 
scene in memory in great detail. 
When you feel attuned to the setting simply remain in the 
chair and for fifteen minutes consciously survey, even move 
into, the multi-dimensional painting you have stored in  your 
memory. Practise this exercise in two-week cycles, selecting a 
different setting for each period. 
You will find that with practice you can easily draw into 
your consciousness a  full array of settings that you have 
OBSERVATION, CONCENTRATION & VISUALIZATION 
63 
collected from this work. You may even try to pull up memories 
of places from your childhood connected with happy moments: 
perhaps an  old house, a  neighbourhood, or a  school that you 
attended. Sit and relax and bring to mind, in minute detail, all 
that you can remember of  a  place. You'll soon find that the 
settings - alive in  your memory - paint their own detailed 
images and you are allowed to sit back, or even move about 
these places, and watch those scenes come alive once again. 
Extend your awareness into everyday activity. If you take 
a daily stroll, drive a regular route to work, or walk the same 
path to the market, try to notice more and more about the route 
and the landscape. See how the changing seasons affect various 
elements of  the route. Observation should not be limited to 
exercises. It is a way of being. 

ETHERIC DOUBLES 
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost 
which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 
For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, 
and in your spirit, which are God's. 
1 Corinthians 6:19, 20 
Within the gross material body of all living organisms there 
exist currents of energy called 'ether', providing life and health. 
The  flow, distribution and  storage of this  energy take place 
within a field which surrounds and permeates the body. We call 
this field the 'etheric double'. 
Every gross material, psychical, and noetical body has an 
etheric double. Each atom and cell in the body possesses an 
individual etheric double: together they combine to form the 
etheric double of a body. 
The etheric doubles serve as moulds in which the bodies 
are first formed. The Archangels of the elements work through 
the etheric double to build a body atom by atom, molecule by 
molecule. A body, once built, is then maintained by the etheric 
double which supplies and  distributes etheric vitality to  its 
various locations. Etheric doubles, always perfect and incor­
ruptible, oversee the life-course of an expressed form according 
to its Circle of Possibility. 

66 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
A body cannot exist without an etheric double, nor can the 
etheric double live independently of the body. An etheric dou­
ble cannot detach itself from its body, except when the body is 
dissolving. 
Both the psychical and noetical bodies have their own 
etheric doubles, which are used as active links between the 
bodies. Apart from overseeing the distribution of energy within 
the gross material body, the etheric doubles are used as conduits 
- for the flow of etheric vitality - between the material, psy­
chical and noetical bodies. 
Familiarity with our etheric doubles is of great concern to 
us. It is vital that we become intimate with their natures so that 
we may control the health within our own bodies and aid others 
in need of healing. Meditation and exercise are the prime means 
for learning more about our etheric doubles. 
On  Etheric Vitality 
Coursing through the etheric double, both penetrating the body 
and extending outwards, are currents of energy. Etheric vitality 
is  Mind  super-substance in  specific vibratory patterns that 
allow for the phenomenon of life. We must not imagine that 
flesh, 
blood or a nervous system create this force. This would 
be equivalent to believing that wire creates electricity. Wire 
may carry electricity, but it is incapable of creating it. Etheric 
vitality is bestowed upon us as our 'daily bread' (Matt. 6:11). 
A widow suffering from a haemorrhage touched Joshua's 
clothes, and He asked, 'Who touched me?' His disciples were 
perplexed, because the crowds were pressing against the Lord 
on all sides. Joshua continued, 'I perceive that virtue is gone out 
of me' (Luke 8:45-46). In another instance He healed hundreds 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
67 
with etheric vitality: 'And the whole multitude sought to touch 
him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all' 
(Luke 
6: 19). 'Virtue', here, refers to etheric vitality. 
We live in a sea of etheric vitality which imbues and sur­
rounds us. On many occasions Joshua drew from the etheric 
vitality 
which covers the globe and shaped it into fish and bread 
to feed thousands (cf. Matt.14:19-21 & 15:32-39). 
On the Ethers 
Etheric vitality breaks down into distinct states to serve particu­
lar 
functions in the maintenance of the three bodies. In the 
etheric double we have identified four classes of etheric sub­
stance: creative ether, sensate ether, imprint ether and kinetic 
ether. This does not mean that an etheric double is divided into 
separate parts,  but that the  super-substance of  Mind, which 
contains within itself all conditions, is adapted in each instance 
to the particular requirement. 
Creative ether is used, under the supervision and accord­
ing to the will of the Holy Spirit, to construct and maintain all 
phenomena of life. The Holy Spirit and the Holy Archangels, 
guided by Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total Love, use 
creative ether to  build,  maintain, and  take care of a body's 
proper functioning. Whatever part  of  the material body we 
study, be it the texture of the brain, the fluid of the eyes, the 
different sense organs, the operation of the glands, the lungs, 
the liver, the intestines - all bear witness to the continuous 
presence of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Archangels. 
Imprint ether is used to shape etheric vitality into psycho­
noetical images and is therefore vital to our work in visualization. 

68 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Using imprint ether we are able to memorize and store images. 
Imprint ether, when used in recording images, helps us see the 
shapes in various sizes, colours and designs. 
Sensate 
ether is the  'feeling giving' ether. By merit of 
sensate ether we experience the sensations of pleasure and pain. 
Sensate ether is also used in conjunction with imprint ether. The 
parallel use  of  these  two  ethers makes the  phenomenon of 
memory possible. 
Kinetic ether facilitates motion. All movements, whether 
conscious or subconscious, including autonomic actions (e.g. 
circulation of the blood, breathing, the receipt, assimilation and 
discarding of substances) take place with the help of kinetic 
ether. 
We must use etheric vitality in a balanced manner without 
interfering with the creative work of the Holy Spirit and in such 
a way as to be worthy of logoic expression. 
On  Etheric Energy Centres 
When God created the human form He endowed us with many 
great gifts. 
The heart is the greatest gift. Through it we may reflect 
Divine Love towards God and our fellow man. The heart is the 
house of the Common Selfhood, the home of the Logos, and 
we must keep it pure, for 'Blessed are the pure in heart: for they 
shall see God' (Matt. 5:8). 
Another gift is the brain with its psychical and noetical 
counterparts. This  is  the  centre of  inspiration and  reason 
permitting us to use Mind to comprehend the presence of God 
all around us. When Moses began to look within himself and 
moved up  to  the  level  of the  cerebellum, symbolized as  a 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
69 
burning bush 
which 
is never consumed, he heard for the first 
time 
the voice of God (cf. Exod. 3:2). The two tablets of Moses, 
on  which were inscribed the Law of God, represent the two 
lobes of the 
human brain  (cf. Exod. 34:28). When, at some 
time, we vitalize 
this 
etheric centre we shall also hear the voice 
of our 
Inner Self, our Self-aware Soul, and become one with 
God's 
Law. 
It 
is through the solar plexus, another valued gift, that the 
Holy Spirit expresses itself as will-power and instinctive wis­
dom.  As  the  seat  of  our  subconscious  awareness the  solar 
plexus is also the storehouse for etheric vitality. Joshua said, 
'He 
that believeth on me ... out of his belly shall flow rivers of 
living 
water' (John 7:38). Joshua is the living water of 'ever­
lasting 
life', and when we drink of Him we 'shall never thirst' 
again (cf. John 4:14). 
The 
fourth gift comprises the reproductive organs which 
will 
come into use at the right time, in the right circumstances 
and 
at the right age. They are  Holy Spiritual. They  are the 
means 
of perpetuating life on the material plane and we should 
not misuse them. 
Corresponding to these gifts are centres of energy. These 
points are known as etheric or psycho-noetical centres. In the 
East they are termed 'chakras'.
Every pore on your skin has a centre. Every gland has a 
centre. Every fingertip has a centre. What is the nature of these 
centres? 
The energy belonging to a centre rotates and creates a 
whirlpool which funnels down towards a point. If you put your 
hand in a basin of water and roll it in a circular motion, a conical 
whirlpool will form. This  is  the basic shape and  pattern of 
motion of the etheric centres. 

70 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
In 
the etheric double of the gross material body we have 
psycho-noetical centres, which we call 'churches' (cf. Rev 
1:20). In  the etheric double of  the psychical body, we have 
psycho-noetical centres, which are more intense in  activity, 
called 
'lamps' (cf. Rev. 4:5). Finally, in the etheric double of 
the 
noetical body, there are even more active centres with a 
wider 
concept of space and time. St. John, in the Revelations, 
refers to these as 'stars' (cf. Rev. 1:16-20). 
These centres serve a  dual function. They care for the 
organs, situated in a particular part of the body, by controlling 
the 
flow and quality of etheric vitality. In another mode they act 
as 
links between the material body of a human personality and 
its 
psychical and noetical bodies, in order to channel thoughts, 
emotions and energy, arising as a  result of space-place-time 
impressions. It  is  through these centres that elementals are 
received 
and stored in  the etheric double and impact on the 
personality. Mind is  shaped into psycho-noetical elementals 
which 
combine to compose the human personality. Elementals 
inhabit 
these centres and exert their influence over the charac­
ter. 
What is  the purpose of these centres? How is  it possible 
for us to work with them? Will we interfere with the work of the 
Archangels? 
When we reach a  certain level of awareness the Arch­
angels will be most pleased to teach us more about the centres. 
However we must first become masters of the elementals that 
we 
are creating and revitalizing. Elementals use these centres, 
for 
better or worse, as entrances and gateways into the person­
ality. We subconsciously cr�ate, invite and absorb elementals 
into our energy centres where they affect the functioning of our 
personality. It is, therefore, imperative that in conjunction with 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
71 
our study of these centres we also gain some understanding of 
the subconscious. 
The following series of exercises will begin to familiarize 
· you with the etheric vitality in your body, will help to teach you
to differentiate between the separate qualities of ethers, and will
allow you to  work gently and self-consciously with certain
etheric centres.

72 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Finger Concentration 
With this exercise we will begin to learn to control the ethers. 
At will we can direct etheric vitality, as kinetic ether, to differ­
ent  parts of our  body and then feel it as sensate ether. This 
exercise will  prove most helpful to those who rely  on  their 
hands: healers, pianists, typists, surgeons and  many others. 
Although this  exercise may appear simple it  requires much 
training and concentration. 
Close your eyes and  raise your hands in  front of you. 
Relax 
and begin to breathe on a 4:4 count. Inhaling, see etheric 
vitality flood into your hands. Exhaling, see  any  darkness 
released into the atmosphere. 
Have all the fingertips come together with an open space 
between the palms. Begin by focusing sensation between your 
little fingers. Ignore the feeling of the other fingers - keeping 
them touching, but with no pressure - pressing only the tips of 
your 
little fingers together. It may be difficult at first as the 
other 
fingers will also want to press. You are trying to concen­
trate sensate ether in these two tips. Relax. 
Now shift your attention, by using kinetic ether, to your 
ring  fingers while slowly relaxing the  little fingers, keeping 
them, 
and the other tips, in loose contact. Concentrate sensate 
ether in your ring fingers as you press them together. Remain 
there and observe the resulting sensations in your body. Con­
tinue to breathe in a calm, patterned manner and relax. 
Next press the middle fingers together - only these two 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
73 
fingertips - and feel the sensate ether pass from one fingertip to 
the other. What do you feel now? 
Move to the index fingers and press these tips together. 
Relax all the other fingers - keeping them in  light contact -
while focusing ether in the tips of your index fingers. Relax. 
Press together the sides of your thumbs - all the other 
fingertips remain in touch, but without pressure. Relax. 
Press the tips of all the fingers together at once. You may 
feel considerable energy in your hands. Now, in reverse direc­
tion, repeat the exercise until you have returned to  the little 
fingers. 
Collect all the energy between your palms, shape it into 
a ball of white light, and place it on any part of your body where 
you  may have some pain (e.g. sore joints, mending bones, 
weak eyes, a wound), or if you know someone who is ill and in 
need of energy offer it to him. 

74 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Sensate and Kinetic Ethers 
Close your eyes and breathe in a patterned manner. Relax every 
muscle in your body. 
Feel the soles of your feet. Be conscious of where your 
feet meet the ground. You are using sensate ether to feel and 
kinetic ether to move in your body. Shift up from your soles 
into the ankles. Feel the entire foot. Feel each of your toes. This 
is sensate ether that allows you to feel your foot. Now move 
your awareness up the legs towards the knees. Feel the sensa­
tion in the knees. You feel from your knees down to the soles 
of 
your feet. Focus your attention and move from your knees 
down 
through your calves, through the ankles, into the toes and 
down again to the soles of your feet. Using kinetic ether, you 
have moved your consciousness at will through your legs, and 
with sensate ether you have felt each part as you travelled. Go 
up to the  knees and down again a few times. Ask yourself: 
'Who am I that I am able to move in my body?' 
After a  while slowly move from your knees upward 
through the thighs, through your pelvic area and into your belly. 
Breathe deeply and descend again down from your belly, 
through your hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles and toes until 
you are in the soles of your feet once more. Move back into 
your 
belly - feeling each point all the way upwards - and back 
down again a couple of times. You may notice some heat gen­
erated in your lower body - that is good; it is the movement of 
ether. 
Settle your attention again in  your belly· and feel your 
solar plexus. Feel all the energy in  your solar plexus. From 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
75 
there move upwards to the  lower section of your chest and 
breathe deeply and easily, feeling the life-giving etheric vitality 
fill your torso. Deep, long breaths. Feel the air in your lungs as 
you breathe. Feel from the shoulders down through the arms -
the full length of both arms all the way down into the fingers. 
Moving downwards from the neck, feel your chest, belly, pel­
vis, thighs, knees, ankles and feet. After a few deep breaths 
reverse direction and move from your toes upwards - calves, 
knees, thighs, belly, torso, and neck, and down into your arms 
and hands. 
Now move your attention to your head - only the head. 
Feel your forehead, eyes, nose, mouth, lips and throat. You may 
sense your ears growing warm. Shift your attention from one 
point 
to another - from the back of your head to your chin, from 
your thyroid to your crown. From the top of your head move 
slowly all the way down to the soles of your feet and then return 
to the head. Feel your entire body. 
Practise this exercise for about ten minutes - moving up 
and down with the help of kinetic ether, and feeling with sen­
sate ether - then relax. 

76 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Vitalizing the Body 
Sit, stand or lie down with your back straight. Completely relax 
for five minutes until your emotions and thoughts are calm. 
This exercise is a combination of patterned breathing and wilful 
direction of energy through the body. Although this exercise 
will 
have us move energy through various etheric centres, 
we 
will not concentrate our attention there. 
Begin breathing on a  4:4 count. After a  few minutes 
inscribe a circle that begins below your genitals, moves clock­
wise 
up over the liver, through the solar plexus, down past the 
spleen, and ending once again below the genitals. As 
you 
breathe in you move towards the top of the circle at the solar 
plexus, 
and as  you release the breath you continue down to 
complete 
the circle at the genitals. See a sky-blue light radiating 
within 
this circle as you continue your measured 4:4 breathing 
for five minutes. As you release each breath, see any dark spots 
you 
may have in  these centres being expelled, and as  you 
breathe in, see a sky-blue globe take form. 
Now move up to the solar plexus. In the solar plexus you 
may 
concentrate and store energy without doing any harm. This 
time 
inscribe a circle that travels over your right lung, moving 
over the heart, continuing downwards over the left lung, 
and 
returning to  the solar plexus. Once again, with a  4:4 count, 
inhale 
as you trace the circle up and around the heart area, and 
exhale as you return down to the solar plexus. Continue for five 
minutes, seeing a warm rosy light emanating from within this 
circle. 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
77 
Finally, begin a circle that starts slightly above your 
heart 
area, moves up over your right shoulder, reaches an apex 
over 
the crown of your head, and moves down past the left 
shoulder, 
returning to the heart area. This circle has as its centre the thy­
roid 
gland. With your 4:4 count, inhale up to the top of  your 
head, and exhale as you return to the starting point just above 
your 
heart. In  this case the circle is  filled with golden light 
around your head, while an orange light surrounds the thyroid 
gland at its centre. Inscribe this circle for five minutes and then 
relax. The circles you have created overlap but the spheres and 
colours somehow remain distinct. 
It is  with kinetic ether that you direct the flow of energy, 
with sensate ether that you feel it, and with imprint ether that 
the circles gain colour and shape. Practise this exercise daily 
and soon, without effort, you will be able to  move etheric 
vitality where you wish. 

ETHERIC ARMS AND HANDS 
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart
; 
who hath not l
if
ted up his soul unto vanit
y
, nor sworn decei
tfu
lly. 
He shall receive the blessin
g 
fr
om the LORD. 
Psalms 24:4, 5 
The material body is an exact replica of the etheric double 
through which it is built and maintained. As your body has 
limbs, so does the etheric double, and every time you move 
your material body the etheric double moves in unison. The 
etheric double cannot be removed from the material body until 
the body is no longer needed. However, it is possible to train 
yourself to use freely your etheric limbs, by lifting them out of 
the material form. An etheric limb has few of the limitations of 
the heavy material body. It may, for example, be used to pene­
trate and extend into gross matter. 
For properly enacting certain exercises, and as an indis­
pensable tool for healing, the development of etheric arms and 
hands is vital. When first freeing your etheric hands you'll 
visualize an elemental of a hand and arm that rises out of your 
material form. After a while you will begin to feel some heat in 
your material arm as your etheric double begins to replace the 
elemental. With steady  practice, preferably daily,  you will

80 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
develop greater control over your etheric limbs. In time you 
may find yourself using your etheric hands in healing, e.g. to 
adjust bones in a mis-aligned back or to lengthen legs. 
The psychical and noetical bodies have their own etheric 
doubles and as you advance in your self-conscious awareness 
you will find that you can train yourself to use these hands for 
much greater work! 
ETHERIC ARMS AND HANDS 
Developing Your Etheric Arms 
By stretching forth thine hand to heal ... 
that signs and wonders may be done by the 
name of thy holy child Jesus. 
Acts 4:30 
81 
Sit in a comfortable chair with your right elbow resting on a 
table. 
A white table top or a white tablecloth will provide good 
contrast between the surface and your material arm. 
Begin to lift your right material arm slowly off the table 
upwards until it touches the right shoulder and then return it to 
the table. Repeat the movement five times noting the way the 
arm moves. 
Raise and lower your arm again five times, but this time 
rotating your hand. Feel and study how the muscles are moving. 
You 
see the network of veins and arteries. It is important to 
observe 
every detail. Do not be in a hurry. You are beginning 
to 
feel the etheric vitality flood into your arm. 
Now with your eyes closed, raise and lower your material 
arm 
very slowly. With your mind's eye see the arm move; you 
see 
all the details of the skin, muscles and bones as the arm 
moves through the air. The etheric double of the arm is moving 
in perfect unison with its material counterpart. You can see the 
material arm glowing in white light. 
Now with your eyes remaining closed leave your material 
arm on the table. See and feel your bright white etheric arm rise 
up out of the material arm. Move it through the air and have 

82 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
your translucent etheric hand touch your shoulder. Can you feel 
it? Slowly move your etheric arm downward and replace it in 
the material arm. Five times raise and lower the arm all the 
while studying the contour and movement of your etheric arm, 
as you flex your etheric hand. You can see it in great detail. You 
can even feel a light breeze caress it as it moves. 
After working for  some time you  may now try  this 
exercise with patterned breathing. With the  same sequence 
described above, try breathing on a 3:3 count, inhaling as you 
move your arm (first material, then etheric) up to the shoulder, 
then exhaling as you lower the arm to the table. If you prefer a 
4:4 count or a 6:6 count, feel free to try. After working with 
your right arm proceed to your left. 
ETHERIC ARMS AND HANDS 
Etheric Hands and Coloured Balls 
Cleanse your hands and purify your hearts. 
James 4:8 
83 
Place your hands on the upper part of your abdomen where the 
solar plexus is located. Close your eyes. Lift your etheric hands 
out 
of the material hands. See these etheric hands snow-white. 
Move them in and out of your material hands a  number of 
times. Feel sensate ether in all four hands. Raise your etheric 
hands in front of your eyes, bringing the tips of all your fingers 
together. Between your cupped etheric hands see a white light 
begin to  grow. It  is  becoming brighter and  brighter until it 
forms a luminous ball which radiates through your hands and 
fingers. 
With the use of imprint ether tum the bright white ball a 
shade of canary-yellow. The ball now glows with the comfort­
ing canary-yellow light of the Logos. As you feel and see your 
etheric hands, feel  your material hands at  the  same time, 
crossed and resting on  the  solar plexus. Inhale comfortable 
deep breaths. 
Return 
your complete attention to your etheric hands and 
the ball of light they contain. See the ball now shift from the 
yellow hue to a clear emerald-green light. Breathe deeply and 
calmly. Feel both your etheric hands and your material hands 
so that you have four hands. Place your etheric hands on your 
chest. Breathe in the emerald-green light. You are filling your 
lungs with strength and vitality. 
Now lower your etheric hands and place them back into 

84 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
their material form. See the hands resume the bright white 
glow. 
Once more inhale deeply and make a short prayer that 
these hands - all four of them - will become healing, life-giving 
hands. 
ETHERIC ARMS AND HANDS 
A Candle Flame 
For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD 
my God will enlighten my darkness. 
Psalms 18:28 
85 
After you are able to use your etheric hands with some com­
mand you may want to try this exercise. 
Rest your right material hand on your right thigh. 
Breathing deeply, begin to move your fingers. Close your eyes 
and study every detail of your hand and its white etheric double. 
Raise your etheric arm out of your material arm and move it in 
front of your closed eyes. Study the hand: the knuckles of the 
fingers, the nails, the fine engraving of the fingertips. 
Create in your etheric hands, from the etheric vitality in 
the air, a  large white candle. Feel how each finger grasps a 
different part of  the candle. With kinetic ether move your 
etheric hand along the candle. Note how it feels in your hands: 
its cool waxiness and solidity. 
In your heart there bums a fire, an everlasting fire of love, 
kindness and compassion. Light the candle with this fire from 
your heart. 
Study the flame. Do you notice that around the base of the 
burning wick it is a little darker? Around and above this darker 
patch the flame is  brighter, starting as orange and turning 
golden-yellow as it crowns. 
If you are envious, anxious or angry the flame will sputter 
and flare. Calm it by relaxing your thoughts and emotions. Pass 

86 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
each desire, thought and emotion through the flame and clean 
your heart and mind: 
First see 
all  your mis-guided thoughts, prejudices and 
judgements stream from your head and pass through the flame. 
Next allow any bitterness, envy and poisonous dissatisfaction 
to leave your heart and be purified by the flame. And finally 
release 
into the flame all the anger and hatred which has been 
stored in your solar plexus. These elementals, such a burden on 
your consciousness, will either be disenergized by the fire and 
sent to the cosmic consciousness, or be cleansed and returned 
to you. 
Your present-day personality has  been purified by  the 
flame. See the flame steady, tall and straight. It is still now. The 
light is clear and the colour bright. 
When the flame is perfectly still, and you feel centred and 
cleansed, thank the Logos. Return the flame to your heart and 
slowly dissolve the candle. 
This cleansing exercise should be practised once a week, 
preferably on Sundays, to bum off all petty thoughts and emo­
tions. 
HEALING WITH BALLS OF  LIGHT 
Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper 
and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 
3 John 2 
Psycho-therapists can  do much work through absent healing 
when they have learned how to create and project light balls. 
They 
must practise creating these healing elementals and load 
each 
one  with the solemn wish that the ball will help restore 
order'within an unbalanced personality. These light balls can 
be 
sent to aid individuals, families, or even entire communi­
ties. 
A psycho-therapist can  train himself in visualization to 
create psycho-noetical balls of  light of  appropriate colours. 
Each colour has a  specific vibration capable of  positively 
influencing a deficiency in a personality. To construct balls of 
light is an act of prayer. What is prayer? The creation of angelic 
elementals. 
There are important responsibilities to remember before 
engaging in this work. One is an ethical matter. We must be 
certain that the recipient of  the light has requested our help. 
Additionally, we  must be sufficiently skilled in knowing the 

88 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
appropriate colours required for various disorders. Deploying 
a colour not suited for the situation can easily aggravate the 
condition. 
As with any healing efforts we must remember that it is 
God's Will and the Divine Plan that allows for healing. Healing 
may only take place when the source of the ailment is resolved. 
As illness is engendered in the personality it may only be recti­
fied within the personality. Outside help is only possible when 
the internal ground for a healing has been prepared. We are 
limited 
both  by  our capacity to help  and by  the recipient's 
readiness 
to find resolution. It is God's Law, Mercy and Grace 
that prevail. 
Finally, when sharing etheric vitality with others, we must 
be 
certain our 'gifts' are pure. If there is within us churning 
hostility, animosity or any sense that we are superior in the 
exchange, 
it is better that we work first with ourselves. Joshua 
teaches, 
'first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and 
offer thy gift' (Matt. 5:24). 
When creating a ball  of  light visualize the face of the 
fellow y.ou wish to help,  either by recalling him from your 
memory or by having his photograph to hand. No matter where 
he may be located on the planet the ball of light will go to him 
and enter his etheric double. 
To a person who is emotionally (psychically) distraught, 
behaving erratically, or plagued by strong desires, send to his 
solar plexus a sky-blue ball of light. 
When a person's internal organs are in disorder, or if he is 
suffering from arthritis, rheumatism, or general physical dis­
comfort, send emerald-green light to his solar plexus. 
If 
someone is stricken with blood contamination, a viral 
infection, or a hormonal imbalance create a small ball of deep 
orange light. Send this ball to the thyroid area of the sufferer. 
HEALING WITH BALLS OF LIGHTS 
89 
Red  light  imparts strength. If  someone is  very  weak, 
depleted 
of physical energy, or anaemic, you can send a ball of 
red light to his heart centre. There it will expand into the shape 
of an egg to energize him. Provided you have loaded the ball 
with the strong desire to help, he will benefit. Never send red 
light to an anxious or nervous person, or to someone with a 
heart condition, for it may harm him. 
If a friend is going through a period of low self-esteem, 
or is angered and potentially violent (as these are often con­
nected) send a ball of rose-coloured light to the heart centre. 
This will calm the sufferer as it is the colour of love. 
When someone is exhausted, downtrodden, fatigued from 
life, or has difficulties sorting out his thoughts, principles and 
ideals (noetical imbalances) send a canary-yellow or golden 
ball 
of light. This will enter the head centre, helping him to see 
things more clearly. 
If you are unsure what is afflicting someone, or if there are 
a number of ailments at once, send a ball of white light. White 
is not a colour in and of itself but a combination of all colours. 
It will enter through the head of the recipient where it will 
assume 
the shape of an egg expanding to engulf his entire body. 
The Archangels will assign the appropriate colours to the white 
light to address each individual problem. 
Many want to help friends and family members who are 
passing-over or who have already made the transition to the 
other side. See them in white light (do not use any other colour) 
and pray that they may rest in peace. Please remember that you 
should include a wish that they move on. Do not bind them to 
this world with your sorrow. 

90 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Balls of Light and Healing Hands 
You will find that while creating balls of light you magnetize 
your  hands, energizing them with  healing power. Here is a 
useful exercise to be practised daily by students of healing who 
desire to become good conduits for the Holy Spirit. A refined 
capacity to  control the  vibrations in  your  hands is  vital  in 
healing work. Each colour owns specific vibrations which can 
be  called upon - through will-power and visualization - to 
correct energy imbalances. 
Close your  eyes. Bring the fingertips of your material 
hands 
together and  concentrate on  the  space between your 
palms. With sensate ether you feel the space. With imprint ether 
create a ball of white light to fill the opening. The ball becomes 
energized as it radiates bright white light. Feel heat emanate 
from the ball and your hands. Take a few deep breaths and 
relax. 
Continue to hold the ball and see it turn emerald-green. 
With every breath you take the ball becomes a brighter hue of 
, 
emerald-green light. Breathe deeply. 
Next see the ball slowly shift to sky-blue light. Breathe 
deeply as the ball glows with the blue light, giving your mate­
rial body a  feeling of comfort. 
After a while the ball begins to radiate rosy light, the hue 
becoming more perfect with each deep breath. 
From the rosy light have the ball turn a fiery red. You are 
holding a ball of mental fire between your  palms. You can 
actually feel the heat but it doesn't burn. It feels good and fills 
your psychical body with vitality.

As the red recedes the ball becomes golden-yellow. Hold 
this ball for a couple of minutes. As you hold it you will find it 
easy to  place your thoughts in order. Your mind is now at 
peace. Your hands are becoming blessed healing hands. 
With your etheric eyes, see your material hands become 
snow-white as if you were wearing shining gloves of radiant 
light. Breathe deeply on a 4:4 measure and with your thoughts, 
concentrate energy in your arms from your shoulders down to 
your fingertips. Now the ball of light is turning a shade of clear 
emerald-green, and as it does so your hands take on the same 
emerald-green light. Continue breathing on a 4:4 count. 
Next you see the ball shift from emerald to blue, sky-blue, 
and soon after your hands shift to blue as well. 
Next the blue light becomes rosy, and once again your 
hands follow suit. You now have a pair of rosy hands. 
Then the ball, and your hands, turn deep red. Breathe in 
and fill your lungs with this energy. 
The ball now changes to canary-yellow and so do your 
hands. Keeping your fingertips together lay your thumbs on 
your chest and breathe in etheric vitality. Consciously feel the 
energy flooding your chest from your hands. Ask the  Holy 
Spirit to bless your hands to help others.

THE ESOTERIC 
PRACTICE 
Creating Balls of Healing 
Light 
Relax and extend your material hands 
out in front of you. Space 
your palms about six inches apait. 
Inhale on a 4:4 count. You are going to construct a ball of 
sky-blue light. In your solar plexus see a sky-blue ball. With 
each inhalation you draw etheric 
vitality from the atmosphere 
into 
your lungs and your solar plexus, 
from where 
it spreads 
out 
into all parts of your body. 
Your arms are also glowing in sky­
blue light. 
Focus the light between your hands. 
It starts as a small 
blue ball which gradually expands 
to fill your palms. 
When the 
ball is complete 
tum it around 
in your palms. Toss it gently in 
the air and have it return 
to your palms. You can feel its solidity. 
You can feel its energy. 
Now you are ready to send it out. Simply 
meditate 
on the 
recipient 
for a few minutes, 
make a prayer that this ball will 
help him, and allow it to leave your hands. 
It doesn't matter 
where 
he is, the ball will reach him. 
To create a ball of rose or red light see a flame kindled in 
your heart. It grows to form a perfectly 
round globe. Allow the 
light from the ball to flood down through your arms, into your 
hands and between 
your palms. 
There a ball of rose or red­
coloured light takes shape. 
When it is fully formed 
release 
it 
with all your love towards 
the person 
in need. 
To create a ball of orange 
light you will need to blend the 
light from your heart (rosy-red 
colour) with the light from your 
HEALING WITH BALLS OF LIGHTS 
93 
head centre (yellow or gold colour). Simultaneously create a 
sphere in the heart, and another in your head. 
See yellow or 
gold light pour from your head down your arms and into your 
hands 
where it meets and melds with a stream of rosy-red light 
from your heart. Together 
they form a brilliant 
orange 
ball, the 
size of a tennis ball, between 
your palms. Send it to the throat 
of a person with a thyroid problem. 
Keep the golden-yellow halo of your head full and com­
plete. Allow your  heart  centre to  become calm. 
Direct 
the 
golden-yellow 
light down your arms to the space between your 
palms." When you have created a golden 
or canary-yellow ball 
of light send it off to a person 
with noetical disturbances. 
You will find that each colour 
has a different feeling, its 
own vibration. Relax 
your arms between each effort and work 
no longer 
than fifteen minutes 
at a time. After a while you will 
be able to create 
these balls of light between 
your etheric hands. 
As you become more proficient at creating and sending 
these 
balls you will learn to sense when the balls are received 
and 
what other help you can offer. 

94 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Balls of Light for Self Healing 
Raise your etheric arms and stretch them out before you. They 
are bathed in white light and in your hands is a ball of sky-blue 
light. Breathe in and out on a 4:4 count. As you concentrate and 
breathe the ball becomes a brilliant blue light like the colour of 
a Mediterranean sky at midday. Place this beautiful blue ball in 
your solar plexus. Breathe in this rich blue light. 
Once again stretch your etheric hands out in front of you. 
Breathing on a 4:4 count see a rosy ball take shape in your 
hands. With each breath the rosy hue becomes richer. When 
you have a radiating ball of pure rosy light place it on your chest 
over your heart, and let your heart absorb this light. 
With 
your etheric hands in front of you see and hold a ball 
of  radiating golden light. Fill  this  golden ball  with etheric 
vitality, and bring it to your forehead towards the bridge of your 
nose. Let the ball fill your head and extend as a gleaming halo. 
Drawing on the rose light from your heart, blend it with 
the 
golden light around your head, and  visualize a  ball  of 
orange 
light in your etheric hands. Shape this orange light - a 
marriage 
of the heart and mind - into a  small ball. Place it on 
your throat in the area of the thyroid. Wish for your blood to be 
clean and pure. 
Finally create a ball of shining white light of life. Breathe 
deeply until this ball is radiating pure snow-white light. Allow 
your 
white etheric arms to shift their colour to a rosy pink - the 
light of logoic love. Study the contrast between the ball of white 
light and your rosy arms. Dedicate yourself to Joshua. 
Slowly see the white ball dissolving into your rosy etheric 
hands. Once it  is  fully absorbed wish good health to  your 
present-day personality with its three bodies. 
CLEANSING AND PROTECTING 
OUR THREE BODIES 
I laugh when I hear the fish in the water is thirsty. 
Kabir 
We  swim in an ocean of etheric vitality that surrounds and 
permeates the globe. Through breathing, sunshine, rest,  and 
food we take this etheric energy into our bodies to replenish and 
restore our health and well-being. Etheric vitality is  no  less 
important to our health than is our warm blood. Each of us have 
habitual patterns of renewing our stock of et.heric vitality and, 
as well, expending this vital energy. No one has greater access 
to etheric vitality than another, only some have learnt to absorb 
it more consciously. Conversely, many carelessly exhaust their 
supplies, finding themselves fatigued, ill-tempered, or  even 
falling ill. 
Let  us say  we  are  granted a  hundred units of etheric 
vitality each day.  The Archangels need 40 units to maintain 
health in our bodies. Simply by living and going about our daily 
lives we  expend a  further 40  units of  etheric vitality. The 
remaining 20 should last the day if we live free from the effects 
of stress. 
If your life is unduly stressful you will find the extra 20 

96 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
units are consumed through worry and anxiety. If you are given 
to fits of anger, depression, episodes of self-pity, or indulge in 
excessive jealousy, you will find yourself drained of all life­
giving 
energy, rendered exhausted and vulnerable. On the other 
hand, if you are peaceful, life-loving and content, you will have 
a bounty of energy that you can share with others. 
The following exercises will help you restore strength in 
your 
bodies and work in a preventative manner to avoid ail­
ments, but they are by no means a substitute for the work of 
cultivating your personality. We have to move beyond the 
self-corruption of obsessively engaging in base emotions and 
desires. This is truly preventative work which will lead us to 
life beyond the realms of distress and disease. 
CLEANSING AND PROTECTING THE BODIES 
A Shell of Light 
Ye are all the children of light, 
and the children of the day: 
we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 
1 Thessalonians 5 :5 
97 
During the day we may feel fatigued by endless activity. We 
need, 
from time to time, to stop and balance ourselves lest the 
stress 
of our hectic lives lead to poor health. 
Sit 
comfortably in a quiet place. Calm your thoughts and 
emotions, let all your worries go. 
As 
you breathe feel etheric vitality fill your lungs and 
extend throughout your body. The oxygen is contained in your 
lungs, but etheric vitality spreads throughout the body. 
Through your breathing a light is kindled within you. 
With each in-breath this interior light becomes more and more 
luminous. As you exhale all the darkness from within leaves 
you. The light continues to radiate and your entire body is now 
glowing with white light. See the light continue to expand and 
take the shape of an egg. This snow-white egg surrounds you 
evenly on all sides .. 
Breathe in the white light. You are clean, healthy and 
energized. Wish good health to your three bodies and your 
present-day personality. 
We suggest that  you practise this exercise after your 
nightly introspection and before leaving your house in the 
morning. By engulfing yourself in a cradle of white light you 

98 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
are benefitted in two ways. Firstly, you help keep your energy 
levels high by not allowing etheric vitality to  seep subcon­
sciously from your etheric double. Secondly, the shell of light 
retards any negative elementals, either directed at you or float­
ing in the common atmosphere. 
CLEANSING AND PROTECTING THE BODIES

Good Health 
Relax completely. Breathe deeply but comf
o
rtably. Be aware 
of the soles of your feet, then your calves, your knees and your 
thighs. Feel you are in both your legs. Feel them, be conscious 
of them. You're using both sensate and kinetic ethers. See your 
legs smrnunded and penetrated by pure white light. 
Now move up to your abdomen, and from the centre of 
your solar plexus create a sky-blue ball that spreads out through 
the abdomen and extends f
o
r a few inches beyond the material 
body. The ball should be perfectly round and about the size of 
a beach ball. Keep your attention simultaneously on your shin­
ing white legs and the blue ball. Breathe deeply. 
In your chest see a globe of rosy light. This ball is slightly 
smaller than the one radiating in your solar plexus. It extends 
outward from your chest cavity and although it  overlaps the 
blue ball, the colours and shapes remain distinct. Your anns and 
legs are bathed in snow-white light, your solar plexus radiates 
sky-blue light, and centred in your chest a rosy globe spreads 
outward. Breathe deeply. 
Keep your f
o
cus on all the colours and, at the same time, 
move your awareness up  into your neck. There, around the 
thyroid, see a bright orange ball about the size of an orange. 
Continue upwards and see a golden light radiating from 
the centre of your head around the entire skull. Inhale deeply 
and visualize your entire body in this array of colours with each 
ball radiating its  distinct colour, overlapping yet remaining 

100 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
unblended. You are blessed with a sensation of perfect health. 
Breathe in these life-giving lights. Wish all your bodies 
good 
health and allow peace to reign in your heart. 'Thy King­
dom come, thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven' (cf. 
Matt. 6:10). 
CLEANSING AND PROTECTING THE BODIES

Health and the Subconscious 
The six-pointed star is the universal symbol of Creation. The 
five-pointed star is the archetypal symbol of the human form 
and a balanced personality. When you invoke these symbols in 
exercise you situate yourself in the harmony of the Divine Plan 
and the perfection of the human form. By orienting the three 
bodies in this essential state of health and well-being you will 
gain self-conscious control over your subconscious. 
Feel your legs from the toes to the place where you are 
sitting. See them radiating a bluish light. Without taking your 
attention 
away from your legs, expand your awareness into 
your abdomen. See your entire body glow with the blue light. 
In the centre of  the solar plexus, see an emerald-green light, 
round and shining like a jewel. 
Move up to the chest and see there a ball of rosy light and 
at its centre a small golden sun. Breathe deeply, see the rosy 
light grow in intensity until your shoulders and arms are also 
radiating this rosy light. Your feet and legs continue to glow in 
the blue light. Now see a ball of orange light at your thyroid, 
and a  canary-yellow or  golden light emanating from your 
head. 
Feel your entire body and breathe deeply. Your head 
glows in a golden gleam, your shoulders, arms and chest in a 
rosy light, your legs and abdomen in a blue light, and the centre 
of your solar plexus in an emerald-green light. See all the col­
ours. 
Now concentrate on the golden halo which extends about 

102 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
six inches around your head. Be in that halo for a while. See 
your entire body tum snow-white. Your body is surrounded by 
a comforting white light. 
Look again at  your solar plexus and  see  a  vibrating 
emerald-green five-pointed star. Look into your chest. On your 
heart centre a yellow six-pointed star has formed. The halo on 
your 
head has taken the shape of a golden triangle rising up off 
your 
shoulders and enclosing your entire head. 
The 
six-pointed star is Creation in Divine harmony. The 
five-pointed star is the human fonn, balanced and healthy. 
Breathe deeply and order your subconscious: 
I want perfect health in my material body. 
I want order and peace. 
I want full control over my psychical body. 
I want to master my emotions and desires. 
I want full control over my noetical body. 
I want sober and constructive thoughts to rule my life. 
Continue to tell your subconscious: 
My thoughts will no  longer enslave me, my  emotions will no 
longer trouble me, and my physical body is clean and vigorous. 
I am the master of my gross material, psychical and noetical 
bodies. I feel strong and healthy in all three bodies! I am the 
master of my destiny! 

Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a 
tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but 
whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the 
other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take 
away 
thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall 
compel thee to go 
a mile, go with him 
twain. Give to him that 
asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not 
thou away. Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love 
thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love 
your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that 
hate 
you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and 
persecute you; That ye  may be the children of your Father 
which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and 
on the good, and 
sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For 
if ye love them 
which love you, what reward have ye? do not 
even 
the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren 
only, 
what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans 
so? Be ye therefore pe1fect, even as your Father which is in 
heaven is pe1fect. 
Matthew 5:38-48 
INTROSPECTION AND 
THE COMMON SELFHOOD 
A new commandment I give unto you, 
That ye love one another; 
as I have loved you, 
that ye also love one another. 
John 13:34 
Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, 
hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, 
and ye shall be the children of the Highest: 
for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
Luke 6:35 
All of us have our own reasons and life-events for turning our 
outward gaze inward. Many are  growing disenchanted with 
materialistic cultures and mentalities that now seem to blanket 
the globe and pervade every aspect of our existence. We are 
struck by the paradox that material wealth has come at the price 
of spiritual poverty. As we are tom from each other, we are tom 
from our Inner Self. So we are turning away from the outer 
chaos towards an inner clarity, an inner calm. 
Yet many of us soon find limits in our work. We find it 
hard to let go of all our worries, our fears, our doubts. We are 

106 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
plagued by distractions and are often unable to summon suffi­
cient will to overcome all the  resistance. We  find ourselves 
caught in a cycle that is difficult to break. We lack faith. 
Faith is the transformation of the personality so that it may 
more properly express its essential nature. When Joshua said, 
'thy faith hath made thee whole' (Matt. 9:22), He was speaking 
of this. All those He was able to heal had already worked on an 
inner transformation. Faith, as such, is an active virtue in which 
the determination to know more of the Divine leads the aspirant 
towards overcoming the egoistic tendencies which have hin­
dered and  harmed. It  is  through faith that  we  slowly and 
methodically let go of the cumbersome emotions and desires 
that prohibit our access to higher energies. 
It has been said that, 'we never really know how ill we are, 
until we begin to improve.' We are careful to protect ourselves 
from seeing the true  extent of  our  corruption lest  guilt and 
remorse grow too great. One of the most difficult chores of a 
Researcher of Truth is that of  confronting himself, allowing 
himself to see the harm he is causing to himself, his family and 
friends. This is not easy, but there is no other way than total and 
endless honesty with oneself. 
The central tool and the most basic practice of seekers, 
from every tradition and age, is daily introspection. Introspec­
tion is exploring the attributes of the present-day personality as 
it expresses itself in itself and in relation to others. 
Our present-day personality is the sum total of the ele­
mentals that we have generated from within or adopted from 
the 
common psycho-noetical atmosphere. Elementals are 
assimilated into our character and form our constitution. The 
cultivation of the present personality starts before birth with the 
traits and tendencies we carry from previous lives. The per-
INTROSPECTION AND THE COMMON SELFHOOD 107 
sonality continues to develop with every experience throughout 
a lifetime, resolving some issues, while creating other obstacles 
for this life and the lives ahead. 
Of our thought and activity eighty per cent are driven by 
subconscious desires and needs. We are seldom aware of the 
origins of our desires, and yet they dictate much of what we 
experience, determining the extent to which we enjoy or suffer 
from life. These needs and desires are in fact clusters of ele­
mentals that we feed with etheric vitality every time we act to 
satiate their desire for fulfilment. 
It is not that a subconscious is 'bad' or 'good', for in most 
people it is a little of both. The subconscious is both inevitable 
and invaluable, and it can be your best friend, when you allow 
it to express Holy Spiritual Intelligence, or your worst enemy, 
when it is overrun by base desires and unbridled emotions. 
The 
subconscious, and the personality in general, can be 
measured both in quantitative and in qualitative terms. As ele­
mentals can be characterized, they can also be numbered. By 
and large, the bulk of our elementals serve egoistic ends rather 
than contributing to the betterment of the Common Selfhood. 
The majority of the difficulties we face result from our regen­
eration of base elementals. 
Even Masters possess a  subconscious. However, with 
Masters the  proportion of  their subconscious to  their self­
consciousness is smaller than ours and, furthermore, they have 
implanted in their subconscious attributes of love and compas­
sion. If  we  liken the subconscious of an average man to an 
infested jungle, these more developed human beings have 
fashioned their subconscious into serene meadows. And when 
a gardener cares for his garden, the garden will care for the 
gardener. 

108 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Introspection is an earnest 
effort to unveil our subcon­
scious to our self-consciousness so that we become 
more aware 
of our motivations 
and activities. It is a process of cleaning the 
subconscious so that we may better know ourselves 
and have 
ever greater control 
over what we think, feel, desire and do. We 
should strive to ensure that the elementals 
composing 
our per­
sonality 
are governed by love, reason and right-thinking. 
Introspection 
will lead us out of the narrow confines of 
our present-day 
personality into an expanded state of aware­
ness. Our petty personality 
will move under the wise wings of 
our  Permanent Personality, although 
not  without protest. 
Remember the egoism 
is crafty and will try to foil our efforts, 
coming forward as 'an angel of light' (2 Cor. 11:14). So 
we 
need to be wary. 
Through 
certain exercises and enhanced understanding, 
we 
will not only clean the subconscious, 
but also clear space, 
making a fitting home for the Logos and the Holy Spirit to 
express Themselves 
through a holy personality. 
When 
we begin to remove and  disenergize elementals 
from our personality we must  use care to fill the resulting 
'vacuum' 
with wholesome 
elementals. 
Elementals exist in a 
delicate 
balance 
with one another 
in the personality, and any 
restructuring must occur slowly 
and surely. This is why lasting 
spiritual advancement takes time.  A personality 
is a careful 
construction - for better or worse - and daily introspection is 
a safe approach 
to improve 
the present-day self towards self­
conscious engagement in the Divine Plan. 
INTROSPECTION AND THE COMMON

Daily  Introspection 
He 
that is slow to anger is better than the 
mighty; 
and he that ruleth 
his spirit than he that taketh a city. 
Proverbs 16:32 
Judge 
not, and ye shall not be judged: 
condemn not, and ye shall not 
be condemned: 
forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
Give, and it shall be given unto 
you. 
Luke 6:37, 38 
Each night, just prior to sleep (when your subconscious 
is more 
porous), 
relax completely and inhale in a 4:4 pattern. 
Either 
lying in bed or sitting up (try not to fall asleep!) 
begin to recall 
the day from start to finish. Review the events 
and encounters 
of the day. With full impunity and leniency 
towards yourself 
and others, 
ask yourself: 
What did I think or feel that I should not have thought 
or felt? 
What did I 
not 
think or feel that I should 
have thought or felt? 
What did I say that I should 
not have said? 
What did I not 
say that I should 
have said? 
What did I do that I should 
not have done? 
What did I 
not 
do that I should have done? 
The goal is not to scold (nor to praise!) yourself or others, but 
simply to study your activity 
as an impartial observer. Work to 
correct 
your behaviour. With time you will grow more accom­
plished at  seeing yourself and  will  find  that  your  moral, 
spiritual and mystical life will accelerate in growth. 

110 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Learning to  Love an  Enemy 
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; 
and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink. 
Proverbs 25:21 
We 
often come into conflict with others in the community, even 
in the family. Some find it  difficult to forgive and will hold 
grudges 
for long spells. As we develop along spiritual lines we 
soon 
learn that in disliking others we are causing more harm to 
ourselves than to  the  subject of  our  hostility. Anger, hatred, 
enmity, 
and other base emotions consume etheric vitality in 
great volume leaving us vulnerable to psychical and physical 
discomfort. We also learn that it is fruitless to hate others when 
we  belong equally to  the  common brotherhood. The Lord 
Buddha put it succinctly when he said, 'hatred does not cease 
hatred at any time; hatred ceases by love.' 
Relax completely. Bring to  mind the  face of  someone with 
whom you have been having problems. Perhaps recently you 
have been quarrelling over a small matter, or maybe it has been 
years since you have spoken because you disappointed each 
other. It doesn't matter now. Just visualize that person's face in 
front of you. 
If you have differences with that person you will see on 
his  face an  expression of  anger or  discontent. This is  the 
reflection of your own feelings. Forget all the differences that 
have been harming your relationship. 
See an expanding sun of light radiating from your heart. 
The light is a soft rose colour and it lights and caresses the face 
of the person in front of you. 
INTROSPECTION AND THE COMMON SELFHOOD 111 
Clean our hearts to reflect Your Love towards you 
and towards all other human beings. Our love is 
Your Love. 
With your thoughts tell your friend, 'I no longer wish any dif­
ferences between us. Let us forget the past.' You can see his 
face 
understanding and agreeing. This person can no  longer 
hate you. 
Now you can see that fellow satisfied and happy. He is 
expressing love toward you and you are returning that love. All 
the differences are  cast away. That friend is  now happy,-no 
longer upset. 
You have helped him and yourself. If it is impossible to 
be together on  the material plane that is all right. But on the 
higher planes you have made peace. You have removed the 
poison of hatred and complaint which handicaps the personality 
and brings illness to the material body. Wish good health and 
happiness to that person.

THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Loving Your Enemies 
Why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, 
but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
Matthew 7:3 
Those that truly love have nothing to forgive. 
Daskalos 
Relax and breathe on a 4:4 count. Bring to mind a collection of 
persons 
towards whom you have some bitterness, or  people 
who have some hostility towards you. 
This is a time for reconciliation, so feel no anger. With 
every out-breath let go of any bad feelings that arise until you 
feel peace. 
It was not they who hurt you. No one can ever hurt you, 
no one at all. Words, however hateful they may be, can never 
hurt you. You only hurt yourself by accepting their energy and 
reacting to the abuse. 
See these people in front of you, taunting you, swearing 
at you, insulting you or even raising a hand to strike you. Your 
reaction is to smile with peace and understanding. In other cir­
cumstances you  might be  quick to  anger, but  now  you 
understand the fruitlessness of an ill-temper. What was it that 
Joshua taught? 
Then came Peter to  him, and said, Lord, how oft 
shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? 
till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto

thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times 
seven [Matt. 18:21, 22]. 
The feeling of being wounded or offended 
is self-punishing. 
The desire to be apologized to is an expression of subtle ego­
ism. And Joshua Emmanuel taught that, 
To hate those who love you is devilish. 
To love those who love you is human. 
To love those who hate you is Divine. 
Return to their faces. They are disarmed by your state of peace. 
They have forgotten why they were angered in the first place. 
See these people with love. It is difficult now to understand 
how it is possible to see any other person as an enemy as we all 
share a common effort to learn and grow. They are your broth­

Whatever society we live in, no matter the trouble cur­
rently besetting the community, let us not have enemies, let us 
not be unnerved by anything that anyone says or does to us. Let 
us sow peace and thereby set an example. 
Before ending the meditation, plant a seed in your subcon­
scious to  think before you  act.  The  next  time  you  are  in  a 
situation where you are inclined to anger or to react harshly, 
pause and recall this exercise. Remember that you cause greater 
harm to yourself than to others when you lose your temper.

Three Suns 
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the 
kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
Matthew 13:4 
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 
Matthew 5:8 
The psychical body of each of us extends for miles around, the 
noetical body much farther. As we move about, thousands of 
people pass through our finer bodies, subconsciously experi­
encing our psycho-noetical attributes. 
Joshua Emmanuel the Christ, as a pure expression of the 
Logos, could pass among the multitudes and thousands would 
be healed. We sow peace and love, or hatred and malice, simply 
by living among others. We can heal or we can harm according 
to the quality of our consciousness. 
As we begin to put our house in order, purifying our per­
sonality, we  learn to  have conscious control over our 
contribution 
to  the  greater psycho-noetical community. We 
begin to maintain the purity of the Mind super-substance by 
shaping it into benevolent and healing elementals. 
Here is an exercise to increase awareness of your bodies, 
and to enable you 
to extend them consciously and contribute to 
the welfare of others. 
Feel in  your heart peace and  love. Breathe on  a 4:4  count. 
Concentrate from the soles of your feet, to your toes and up to 
your ankles. Now from the  ankles spread your awareness 
through your calf muscles into your knees. You are aware of 
your legs from the soles of your feet to your knees. 
INTROSPECTION AND THE COMMON SELFHOOD 115 
Continue breathing while you expand your concentration 
through your thighs and up into the pelvis. You feel the entire 
length of your legs now as they glow in a snow-white light. 
Wish good health to your legs. 
Now continue spreading your awareness by moving up 
into the abdomen. Feel your solar plexus and see a small sky­
blue ball begin to take form. It grows brighter and brighter with 
each 
breath you take, until it reaches the size of a beach ball. It 
is transparent and extends all around your abdomen. 
Maintain your concentration on your snow-white legs and 
the  sky-blue ball  in  your solar plexus, and  now have your 
awareness encompass your chest cavity. In your chest see a 
rosy light the size of a tennis ball. Watch it as it expands and 
grows brighter and brighter until your entire chest is radiating 
this lovely light. The blue light of your solar plexus and the rosy 
light of your chest overlap but remain distinct spheres of light. 
You have full  sensation from your chest down to your 
toes. Continue breathing as  you notice that your arms are 
glowing with the same white light as your legs. Pray your arms 
be 
blessed that they may be used to ease the pain of others and 
to 
wipe away the tears of your fellow man. 
Now move up  through your neck and  into your head. 
Clear your thoughts and see a golden hue begin to surround 
your head. Extending a foot outwards on all sides you have a 
luminous golden halo. This golden aura meets the rose light of 
your chest but each colour and each ball keeps its shape and hue. 

116 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Now your entire body is radiating light: your legs and 
arms shine with great whiteness, your abdomen and  solar 
plexus are engulfed in a lovely sky-blue ball, your heart and 
chest are emanating a rose-coloured globe, and your head is 
surrounded by a beautiful golden hue. 
You have a desire to share with others the harmony you 
are experiencing. 
See the blue ball expand to reach far beyond the area in 
which you stand. See it bathe every living being with peace and 
contentment. Now bless your material body and  ask  that  it 
always be clear. 
The rose light in your chest begins to grow in circumfer­
ence to cover a huge area of many, many miles. Wish love to 
all as they are bathed in this light of love and peace. Wish peace 
to your psychical body, and to the psychical body of every other 
being. 
The range of the golden light, as it spreads out from your 
head cannot be measured. Perhaps it blankets the entire conti­
nent 
or even the globe. See all who dwell within this golden 
halo to be in the peace of knowing and understanding. May 
your noetical consciousness be  always blessed, and  may it 
always bless others. 
The three balls that were in your material body have now 
blossomed into three great suns. 
INTROSPECTION AND THE COMMON SELFHOOD 117 
After a while slowly, slowly contract the suns; first the 
golden halo, next the rosy light and finally the sky-blue ball. 
Wish good health to all other human beings and to yourself.

THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Creating Peace 
These things I have spoken unto you, 
that in me ye might have peace. 
In the world ye shall have tribulation: 
but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. 
John 16:33 
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, 
to the which also ye are called in one body; 
and be ye thankful. 
Colossians 3: 15 
This exercise is helpful when you know of  a  location where 
there 
is unrest and violence, perhaps a friend's house, or a vil­
lage, or any place on the globe. You can help calm tempers and 
allow people to see things more clearly by flooding these areas 
with rose light from your heart. 
Begin by inhaling comfortable deep breaths. Slowly 
inhale 
white light, exhaling any darkness. Your material body 
is 
now glowing in bright white light while your etheric double 
is turning sky-blue. 
Your consciousness is  becoming lighter and no longer 
hindered by heavy thoughts and emotions. Begin to  expand 
your consciousness in every direction from where you are sit­
ting. 
It  passes out of  the building, above the trees, like a 
growing bubble, until you can see the town in which you live. 
A lovely rose light pours out from your psycho-noetical heart 
blanketing first your neighbour's home, then the whole neigh­
bourhood and finally the entire town. You feel joy. 
INTROSPECTION AND THE COMMON SELFHOOD 119 
You continue to expand to the point where you can see the 
entire nation. Perhaps there is trouble in some part of it. Your 
heart continues to pour out love for all. The whole country is 
now covered in this light. 
Next spread your awareness to encompass first the cloud 
cover and then the atmosphere. You can see the whole planet. 
It is a gorgeous paradise of deep blue oceans, vast mountain 
ranges and lush plains. But you know there is fighting in vari­
ous parts of the world, great unhappiness, and you want to help. 
From where you are, there are no borders marked, no lines 
separating people. It is one world. All trouble is born of ignor­
ance and misunderstanding. We want to love one another and 
live in peace. 
Now your heart is a river of rose light which floods the 
entire 
globe with peace and love. You see millions of smiling 
faces bathed in the rose light. You see men laying down their 
arms and embracing one another in common brotherhood. You 
see people giving food and clothes to others in need. 
Now you see the planet move towards you and nestle in 
your heart. Moments ago you were on the planet and now it is 
in you. Keep the planet in your heart. You are once again back 
in your present-day personality. 
Breathe deeply until you feel you have fully returned. 
Wish peace and harmony to prevail the world over.

Communal Prayer for Peace 
Love all God's Creation. The whole world and eve,y grain of sand. 
Love eve,y leaf and eve,y ray of God's light. 
Love eve,ything. But remember that you must face 
the mystery of God in everything you love. 
Feodor Dostoevsky 
The power of prayer to  heal is now gaining much attention. 
Scientists and doctors are beginning to recognize that focused 
love 
and care for others is a  powerful remedy in the healing 
process. 
Of 
related significance has been the recent recognition of 
communal prayer in  affecting positive change over a  given 
population. Tests have proven that if one per cent of a popula­
tion 
collect in unison prayer, a sharp change in behaviour can 
be 
scientifically measured within that population. Such is the 
power of thought, such is the strength of love. 
There is too much pain, sorrow and strife in the world. 
Many want to contribute to the amelioration of the wounds of 
humanity 
yet feel helpless. Across the globe there is a network 
of 
Researchers who synchronize their prayers for world peace 
and harmony. You are welcome to join this community. 
Each 
day at 9:00 pm sit and clear your mind of all thoughts, and 
fill your heart with unconditional love. If you are a Christian 
first recite the Lord's prayer or, should you belong to another 
faith, recite your own prayers. 
Envision peace flourishing in the hearts of  every man, 
woman and child in every part of the globe. Sit in peace for 
a 
few minutes and then, either internally or aloud, recite this short 
prayer: 
INTROSPECTION AND THE COMMON SELFHOOD 121 
Peace on Earth and goodwill to all. 
Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. 
There are many timezones and each of  us will pray at  a 
particular hour - at 9:00 pm local time. It is invaluable to con­
tinuously fill this holy and blessed elemental of love and peace 
with etheric 
vitality

Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom 
of 
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, 
and sowed in his field: Which indeed is the least of all seeds: 
but 
when it  is  grown, it  is  the  greatest among herbs, and 
becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in 
the branches thereof 
Matthew 13:31, 32

His delight is in the law of the LORD; 
and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 
Psalms 1:2 
Be still, and know that I am God. 
Psalms 46: 10 
Holy 
monadic forms are like the cells of the body of Absolute 
Beingness. They belong to the Nature of God as Its Multiplicity 
and Self-sufficiency. Yet as expressions they cast an autono­
mous and individuated reflection into the worlds of 
separation. 
We marvel at the great diversity we see around us. There 
are insects which live but seconds, olive trees that have lived on 
since before the time of Joshua the Christ, and galaxies which 
form and dissolve over the course of billions of years. There is 
perfect harmony and balance throughout the  natural world 
extending to the farthest reaches of the universe. 
What dictates the life-course of each expression to allow 
the phenomena of life? Where are Divine Wisdom, Love and 
Almightiness within these forms? 

124 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
The Christ Logos and the Holy Archangels conduct the 
genesis 
and development of each form, acting upon a Principle 
instilled within each expression. We call this Principle the Cir­
cle of Possibility. 
Each Circle of Possibility is immutable. It demarcates the 
range of  experience possible for every expressed form. There 
is no  transmigration between forms. Humanity always keeps 
the human form; for, 'Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive 
berries? either a vine, figs?' (James 3: 12). 
The simpler the form, the more discernible is its Circle of 
Possibility. 
A flower will emerge from a bulb and grow until 
ready 
to share its wonders, before it returns to the soil. Other 
forms own more complex Circles. 
The Circle of Possibility of the human form - a cherished 
form in Creation-
delineates the (seeming) departure from our 
complete unity with 
God and the gradual return to the Godhead, 
predicated on the development and purification of conscious­
ness. The full Circle of our form strings together a long series 
of incarnations allowing a diversity of experience throughout 
ages, cultures and communities. A smaller loop inscribes the 
sequence of a single lifetime taking a personality from birth, 
through adolescence, and into old age, exposing him to a broad 
spectrum of sensations, perspectives and events invaluable to 
the process of expanding consciousness. 
Circles are, at times, interrupted. In conjunction with the 
Circle of Possibility is the Principle of the Circle of Probabil­
ities. This stipulates that any Circle may be withdrawn for a 
variety 
of reasons. A seed may not germinate. Or a seedling 
may be over-watered and rot. Trees can become diseased and 
die. A child may pass-over (to continue his evolution in another 
dimension). These interruptions, when viewed from the limits 
THE CIRCLES OF POSSIBILITY AND PROBABILITIES 
125 
of 
our vantage point, may appear unfair or even cruel. Yet 
again, it is in accordance with the Total Wisdom, Love and 
Power of the Divine Plan. 
Developing an 
awareness of the grandeur of the Circles 
of 
Possibility and Probabilities is instrumental in the cultivation 
of consciousness to higher states. In many ways our ancestors 
were more sensitive to the presence of God, the Logos and the 
Holy 
Spirit, than we are today, as they lived in harmony with 
the cycles of nature. They saw God's hand behind the 
changing 
seasons 
and life's continual passages, in ways we have forgot­
ten. 
We must again see what a tremendous gift this world is. 
Meditation on the many Circles of Possibility and Probabilities 
evident around us will clear and expand our vision.

An  Almond 
Tree 
I  remember 
the days of old; 
I meditate 
on all thy works; 
I muse on the work of thy hands. 
Psalms

Blessed 
of the LORD 
for the precious 
things of heaven, 
for the precious

Deuteronomy 
33:13,14 
All around 
us there 
are so many 
wondrous 
forms. 
In Cyprus 
we 
have beautiful 
almond 
trees. 
Let us examine 
the Circle 
of Pos­
sibility 
of an almond 
tree as it passes 
through 
the seasons. 
You 
may use any fruit-
or nut-bearing 
tree that is indigenous 
to your 
area. 
Visualize 
an almond 
tree.  In winter 
you see the tree as 
though 
it were 
completely 
dried 
up. Pure white 
snowflakes 
are 
dancing 
in the air, and fall gently 
on to the tree and the ground 
until all is covered 
in snow. 
The trunk 
and the leafless 
branches 
stand 
out against 
the white 
background. 
Study 
this tree for a 
while 
and breathe 
deeply. 
As time passes 
the snow 
melts 
and the almond 
tree beo-ins 
to shoot 
forth buds, 
tender 
buds. 
Watch 
these 
buds evolve 
as the 
days 
pass. 
Every 
few seconds 
of observation 
is like  another 
day. You are controlling 
time! 
Soon 
the buds open 
up and lovely 
blossoms 
appear. 
Del­
icate white 
and pink, 
sweet-smelling 
blossoms 
explode 
all over 
the tree while 
just a few moments 
ago it was still blanketed 
with 
snow.

Bees 
buzz 
from 
one flower 
to the next, 
pollinating. 
Feel 
the freshness 
in the air; the cold weather 
is gone 
and spring 
has 
fully arrived. 
See the petals 
fall softly 
to the ground 
much 
in the same 
manner 
as the snowflakes 
did. A bed of petals 
collects 
under 
the 
tree. Look 
around 
the meadow 
where 
your almond 
tree stands. 
It is teeming 
with life. What 
can you see? 
With 
time the petals 
soak into the ground 
or are washed 
away 
by the winds. 
By now young 
almonds 
are taking 
shape 
all 
over the tree. It is late spring 
and the daytime 
temperatures 
are 
very warm. 
The once 
muddy 
ground 
is now sun-soaked 
and 
dry. Beads 
of sweat 
form 
on your brow 
and you take shelter 
in 
the shade 
of the tree. 
You 
watch 
as summer 
rolls by and the almonds 
grow 
in 
size with each passing 
moment. 
Autumn 
replaces 
summer. 
The 
time has come 
to harvest 
the nuts. 
You watch 
people 
as they 
gather 
the nuts into bags and take them 
away 
in carts. 
The air turns 
crisp 
again. 
The leaves 
of the almond 
tree 
begin 
to pale, and one by one are swept 
away 
by an early 
winter 
wind. 
A year has passed 
and snow 
falls again. 
You have studied 
the tree - in all its seasons!

In All the Works of Thine Hands 
Deuteronomy 16:15 
Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. 
Psalms 17:5 
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; 
and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 
Psalms 33:6 
There is not so much like God in all the universe as silence. 
Meister Eckhart 
No path is even and no travel without some spells of disquie­
tude. Few among us can say that we haven't, at one time or 
another, shared Thomas's desire to see the nail prints (cf. John 
20:27). In a world so tangible, we seek the apparently illusive 
and are frustrated or even despondent when ready proof escapes 
us. 
There are no miracles other than life itself. Spread out 
before us is an immaculate testimony to the presence of the 
Divine. Periodically we should transcend the chaos of everyday 
existence and meditate on the Total Wisdom that carries life. 
Relax and breathe on a 4:4 rhythm. You are going to conquer 
any existential anxiety that has arisen and reconfirm your faith 
in the Divine order of things. 
Let 
us begin with a  study of the human body. What a 
marvel it is. Consider how the two lobes of the brain are kept 
safe in a bony skull and how your eyes also nestle in a protec­
tive casing. Your eyelids, brows and lashes work together to 
protect them from danger. Your heart and lungs are guarded by 
a sturdy cage of ribs. Your liver and spleen and other organs are 
less vulnerable thanks to the protective peritoneum. Your gen-
THE CIRCLES OF POSSIBILITY AND PROBABILITIES 
131 
itals are well placed, secured from harm. The dexterity of your 
arms 
and hands have yet to be duplicated by machines as sci­
entists and engineers admire the ingenuity of the opposing 
thumb. We move about skillfully thanks to our well-designed 
legs 
and feet. 
Of those who have taken the time to study the glorious 
human 
body few have failed to be astounded. The nervous, 
respiratory, immune and blood circulation systems work in 
perfect order and interplay- all powered by etheric vitality. The 
capacity to carry and sustain a child, the inner workings of the 
organs, 
down to the precise and minute motions of cells, 
molecules and atoms, testify to an incomparable wisdom. 
From the cleansing and life-giving rivers and waters to the 
importance of the forest and foliage as great filters, we have 
grown increasingly aware of the delicate balance of the earth's 
ecosystem. 
Have you studied how the cycles of the seasons lend time 
to the land that it may be rich and giving? And all this takes 
place under a carefully layered atmosphere. You should aspire 
to comprehend the wisdom of the planet. 
Do 
you know that without our moon, which spins ele­
gantly around our earth at a speed of 2,300 miles an hour, the 
earth would slip into another orbit. Imagine how perfectly sus­
pended our earth, our home, is from the sun. 109 times greater 
in size than the earth, the sun is positioned no further than 95 
million miles and no closer than 93 million miles from the 
earth. A deviation of a few percentage points in either direction 
would create conditions hostile to human life. There is an 

132 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
immaculate balance and harmony within this planetary family. 
We 
spin around our sun at a dizzying rate of  66,600 miles 
an hour, while our entire solar system rides through our galaxy 
at a speed of 150 miles an hour. It requires 225 million years for 
the sun to orbit the galaxy, which itself is propelled through the 
gross material universe at a speed of 35,000 miles an hour. Yet 
on a summer morning you can step out of your door and not a 
leaf on a poplar tree wavers, nor a ripple disturbs a placid sea. 
There is nothing in the  universe that is not also in  the 
human body, and there is nothing in the human form that is not 
also present in the universe. 
In  times when our  troubles seem too  many, let  us 
remember what a haven this world of ours is and how perfectly 
designed life is to allow us to live and learn. By any human 
measure the larger science of Life is difficult to fathom, well 
beyond known statistical probability. And then let us remember 
that  life  is not, nor ever was, a  question of  probabilities or 
coincidences, but a most ordered and wise process in accor­
dance with the Divine Plan. 

And 
he said, A certain man had two sons: And the younger of 
them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods 
that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living. 
And not  many days after the  younger son  gathered all 
together, and took his journey into a  far country, and there 
wasted 
his substance with riotous living. 
And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in 
that 
land; and he began to be in want. And he went and joined 
himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his 
fields to feed swine. 
And 
he wouldfain have filled his belly with the husks that the 
swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. And when he came to 
himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have 
bread 
enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will 
arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have 
sinned 
against heaven, and before thee, And am no more wor­
thy 
to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. 
And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a 
great 
way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, 
and
fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, 
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am 
no more worthy to be called thy son. 
But 
the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, 
and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his 
feet: 
And bring hither the fatted ca(f, and kill it; and let us eat, 
and 
be merry: For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he 
was lost, and is found. 
Luke 15:11-32 
HE  WAS LOST, AND IS  FOUND 
For in him we live, and move, and have our being. 
Acts 17:28 
There is no other parable of Joshua that speaks so clearly of the 
human condition as does the story of the Prodigal Son. It is as 
much 
the drama of the human form as it is the biography of 
each of us as Spirit-Soul-Ego. 
We learn of the separation born of free will: 'a journey 
into 
a far country', tells of the humanization of an Archangelic 
Order 
for a sojourn in the worlds of duality. 
We hear about a bitter-sweet life of indulgence and waste 
leading to Self-realization: 'wasted his substance with riotous 
living ... to feed swine ... when he came to himself'. With time, 
both tired and awakened by a long series of incarnations, he 
heads back home. 
And then comes the repentance and the desire for reunion: 
'I have sinned against heaven, and before thee ... make me as 
one of thy hired servants', he intends to beg of his father. But the 
father had expected his son's return and 'ran' to embrace him. 
This is a story of separation and reunion; but, above all, it 
is a lesson of a father full of love for his children. 
To conclude our lessons we often take the listeners into 

136 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
a 
state of introspection where they are reminded of their 
essential nature and purpose. The meditations within this sec­
tion are examples of these journeys.

Ye Have Been with Me from the Beginning 
John 16:27 
Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling,

but according to his own purpose and grace, 
which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began 
2 Timothy 1 :9 
137 
Relax completely. Feel you are in your toes, feet, calves, thighs, 
abdomen, and chest. Breathe deeply and comfortably and relax 
every 
muscle in your body. Silence your psychical body. Let go 
of all negative emotions and desires. Begin to  slow your 
thinking; indulge in fewer and fewer thoughts until your noeti­
cal body is calm. 
Feel you are everywhere in your material body: your head, 
chest, hands, abdomen, legs, and feet. You have to slow down 
your way of thinking and feeling. Slowly ask yourself: Who am 
I? Don't be in a hurry. Who am I in this material body? Is this 
material body mine? I am in it. I live in it. But who am I really? 
Breathe deeply and comfortably. Who  am  I  who  can 
change the rhythm of my breath? Previously I was breathing 
subconsciously, my breath being  guided by the Holy Arch­
angels. But now I take control and breathe willingly to the 
rhythm of my heart. 
Take control of what? Of your emotions. For unbridled 
emotions and desires will exhaust your psychical body. 
Breathe deeply. You can become master of your home, 
your material body. Now you can influence your subconscious, 
your personality's subconscious. Say, in  your mind, /  want 

138 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
pe1fect health in this material body of mine. The Archangels are 
laughing: 'What are we doing all  the time? Are we not con­
stantly restoring good health in your body?' Of course they are, 
but you must realize this. Order your subconscious to aid in the 
work 
of the Archangels. Help them to help you. Breathe deeply 
and repeat: / want perfect health in this material body of mine. 
Forget your name, forget your human form. You want to 
investigate your Selfhood, not the material body, not gross 
matter. 'It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth noth­
ing' [John 6:63]. You are the Spirit. 
What am I?  An entity receiving impressions from the 
material world? Yes, I am also that. But I am more, much more. 
I am I.  This I-ness, myself, I want to know. I want to enter into 
full Self-Realization. 
Who 
am I?  What am I? I have cast away my emotions, 
desires and thoughts, and yet I remain myself I am I. That I­
ness 
I want to know and feel as myself I am not my desires, my 
weaknesses, nor my thoughts. These are constantly changing. 
But my I-ness does not change. I am everlasting Life. Even in 
a dreamless deep sleep, I am I. Waking, I recompose my petty 
little time-and-place self, yet I am the I-ness. I am Life and I am 
the Truth. What am I then? 
You may not receive the answer immediately, but some time 
you will awake and know the answer. The Holy Archangels and 
your Guardian Archangel have heard you and, when the time is 
right, they will reply to  your questions. Continue breathing 
deeply and comfortably. 
HE WAS LOST,  AND IS FOUND 
I Am in My Father and Ye in Me, and I in You 
John 14:20 
If the only prayer you say in your whole 
life is 'thank you' that would suffice. 
Meister Eckhart 
139 
Relax your material body completely. Move your attention 
from your toes, through your feet, thighs, abdomen, chest, and 
up to your head. Feel you are completely relaxed, no tension 
whatsoever. 
You are living in a material body and yet you know very 
little about it. The Holy Archangels of the elements are working 
in your body. They care for the circulation of your blood, your 
breathing, and for the steady beat of your heart. In perfect har­
mony, with Total Wisdom, the Archangels take care of your 
health, making your body a fitting home for you to live in. You 
feel your material body with the sensate ether in your etheric 
double. You are in your material body. 
You must begin to  understand how these Holy Arch­
angels - one Archangel from each Order - are working for you. 
It is your body, and you feel it now. It has been given to you to 
make good use of. Yes, it is yours! It is a  perfect gift of the 
Absolute Infinite Beingness as  part of the Divine Plan. It  is 
given to you, a human being, so that you may express yourself 
through it. For you the material body is a reality because you 
can feel it. Master this material body of yours and make good 
use of it. 
You are also a living personality - a man or a woman with 
a name and certain characteristics. This is you as a present-day 
personality, as a logoic being expressing itself in Creation. As 

140 
THE ESOTERIC 
PRACTICE 
this personality 
you exist in time, place and space, 
to be born, 
to live, and some 
day to pass-over. 
You express 
yourself 
as 
emotions, 
desires, 
and thoughts. 
Now, 
try to separate 
an emotion 
from a thought 
and you 
will find that you have enslaved 
your thought 
to your emotions 
and your desires. 
But emotion 
and thought 
are Mind 
in two 
different 
frequencies 
of vibration. 
You are expressing 
yourself 
as both emotions 
and thoughts. 
Ask  yourself: 
'Who 
and  what 
am  I  as  a  feeling 
per­
sonality, 
and who and what 
am I as a thinking 
being?' 
I see before 
me a threefold 
mirror: 
the material, 
psychi­
cal and noetical 
bodies. 
What 
kind of self do I see now in these 
mirrors? 
A self completely 
distorted. 
Can I see this self of mine 
clearly 
reflected 
so as to know 
who and what 
I really 
am? 
You 
are not your material 
body, 
you are not your emo­
tions and you are not your thoughts. 
They are given 
to you to 
use so that one day you may realize 
who you are:  a Spirit­
Soul-Ego. 
Your 
Spirit-Ego-Being 
is beautiful 
and perfect, 
though 
your personality 
may not always 
be so. Your Inner 
Self, the 
Inner 
Self  of everyone, 
is a  Divine 
god.  Try  to  make 
your 
time-place-space 
self, your personality, 
as pure and perfect 
as 
your Inner Self. 
HE WAS LOST, AND IS FOUND 
141 
How are you living? 
See yourself 
now in your base emo­
tions, 
in your weaknesses, 
in the subconscious 
reactions 
of your 
personality 
to the environment. 
Do you believe 
that you have 
enemies? 
Your 
heart has not been given 
to you to hate and 
complain. 
Your heart has been given 
to you to reflect 
the Love 
of Absolute 
Infinite 
Beingness. 
Do you allow 
yciur heart to 
reflect 
the Light, 
Love and Life of Absolute 
Infinite 
Beingness, 
your Father? 
God is our Father. 
As Spirit-Ego-Beings 
we are always 
in 
Him and have never 
been created. 
But as human 
beings, 
as 
present-day 
personalities, 
we have been created. 
We need to 
realize 
that in our present-day 
personality 
is the Divine 
Spark, 
our Inner Immortal 
Self. 
You must ask sincerely: 
Who 
am I? A  feeling 
and think­
ing being 
in a material 
body? 
What 
am I as life and who am 
I 
even 
as a phenomenon 
of life? 
Practise 
this meditation 
each day and a reply will come 
from 
within. 
With 
this  kind  of  meditation 
what 
are  we  doing? 
Creating 
constructive 
elementals 
to help us see the truth. Every 
thought, 
every 
emotion, 
creates 
an elemental. 
So you have to 
know how to create 
or revitalize 
constructive 
elementals 
for the 
betterment 
of yourself 
and others.

THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
I Am with You Alway, Even Unto the End of the World 
Matthew 28:20 
The meaning of human life is the establishment of the 
Kingdom of God on earth, and that means 
the replacement of the egoistical, hating, dictatorial, and irrational 
things with a Life of Brotherhood, Freedom and Reason. 
Leo Tolstoy 
Breathe deeply and comfortably. Feel completely relaxed in 
your material body, no tense muscles. Calm down your emo­
tions and thoughts. 
So many thoughts and desires are coming to me. Ele­
mentals I  have created disrupt my concentration, presenting 
themselves as pressing desires. 
Suppose these desires are fulfilled, will they give me the 
pleasure I first imagined having? Looking into my past I recall 
countless desires. Many of them were fulfilled, then quickly 
forgotten, 
and after a  little while new, stronger desires 
appeared. 
Usually  we  desire  something on  the  material plane. 
However, once we possess it, it loses all appeal and value and 
we want something else; and then something else again; always 
something 
bigger and better than before. All that time wasted 
in 
pain, agony, and anticipation -
an endless chain of desires 
with fleeting satisfaction. 
Is it not time to control these feelings? If it is impossible 
to fulfil a desire egoism will come forward to 
torment you, 
demanding satisfaction. Egoism is never reasoning. Egoism, 
HE WAS LOST, AND IS FOUND 
143 
when very irrational, can lead to violence and crime. Egoism is 
obstinate. Should we follow it, or study the circumstances and 
decide to control ourselves? 
We have to think seriously about the nature of desire, any 
desire, 
the result of its fulfilment, and of the frustration of an 
unmet desire. This is daily life. We create and revitalize an 
endless parade of elementals with our thoughts, desires, needs 
and emotions, thereby composing the subconscious of our per­
sonality. 
Using reason I learn that I am not my desires, I am not 
my emotions, nor am I my thoughts. I am not my egoism -with 
its obstinacy and cruelty - often leading to enmities, malice, 
and crimes. 
Breathe deeply. I am a Soul. I am I. I am living and living 
is something very precious. I must value my life and the lives 
of others, even those who consider themselves my enemies. Do 
I have the right to make people unhappy? Do I have the right to 
make my life unhappy? Each day my inner reality, my Spirit­
Self, is blessing my personality with a new day of lzfe. 
Breathing is life. Breathe in rich oxygen; it is life-giving 
etheric vitality. Yet vitality is not life. Life is He, the Love, the 
Prince of Love. He is here in every one of us. He is the Logos 
and we are logoic Beings within Him. Bring Him into your 
personality. Breathe Life. 
By doing this exercise daily what do you think will happen? 
Provided you do it properly and you do not allow thoughts and 
emotions to come and disturb you, an Archangel, or your 

144 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Guardian Archangel, will appear in front of you. Or,  if  you 
concentrate on  the  Logos, Joshua Emmanuel the  Christ will 
appear. 
Develop your sight and you will see Him. He is every­
where. We first reach Him through attunement to  Him and, 
some day, we will become one with Him. This is real happi­
ness. Happiness is in us, in the Kingdom of the Heavens which 
is our Being. 
AN ESSENE PRAYER OF JOSHUA 
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, 
and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself 
Luke 10:27 
In  conclusion we present a  meditation given by  Joshua 
Emmanuel the Christ, our Lord, in the synagogue of the Essene 
Brotherhood, to  His disciples before sending them into the 
world to work as teachers and healers. 
Relax completely. Visualize Joshua Emmanuel the Christ 
standing before you as you sit peacefully, listening. In perfect 
at-one-ment 
with His Divine Self, the Logos, and attuned with 
each and every human being, Joshua spreads out His arms and 
says: 
All of you, listen. You are my children, my offspring. I am 
in 
you as God, as Absolute Beingness, your real Self, and you 
are always in. me as gods. And I am also with you as a human 
being, as your loving father, within our loving Father.

body, is a fatherly kiss of mine for you. My beloved ones, I will 
not only speak to you in words of any language, but will also 
come to you as inspiration and as sensation. 
I  am the heat which keeps your body alive. I  am the 
breeze, the fresh air, that caresses your face. I am in your eyes 
-as your sight -allowing you to enjoy my works around you,
as phenomena of life. I am the sight and I see all.
I  am continuously creating Mind substance for  you, to 
keep your bodies thriving. I am the living 'bread of life' [John 
6:48]. And I am the living water which you will drink and never 
thirst again [cf John 4:10-14]. I am the Mind vitality every­
where 
in the world. I am Spirit and I am form. You are in my 
Omnipresence. 
I am the wise voice in your minds that speaks to you when 
you are doing something which is not right; not rebuking but 
awakening you. For I am reason in your thoughts and I am love 
in your heart. 
Cast away from your heart every bitter emotion, all 
enmity, and any cruelty you may harbour .... I am the Life in 
you. Enjoy my Life. You are my offspring, you are my flesh and 
blood, part of myself 
I love you. Love all my expressions, love all other human 
beings as your own self, and love all of life 'as I have loved 
you', and as I will always love you [John 13 :34 J. 
147 
GLOSSARY 
ABSOLUTE BEINGNESS, ABSOLUTE INFINITE BEINGNESS, 
GOD, THE FATHER, ALLARA 
What we know of God we see in reflection as witnessed both 
externally and internally. Absolute Beingness is, above all, the 
Divine Common Selfhood, as Beings within the One  Being. 
Love, Light and Life belong to the primary Nature of Absolute 
Beingness as Total Love, Total Wisdom and Almightiness. The 
Love 
of God is universal, ceaseless, and unconditional. It is the 
Love of God, expressed as Grace, which lies at the core of Crea­
tion. 
The  Light is  pure, luminous Super Self-consciousness. 
Everlasting Life is the eternal motion, generation and regener­
ation of  Its  expression. Other characteristics of  Absolute 
Beingness, in  Its  Omnipresence, include Multiplicity, Self­
sufficiency and the Will-pleasure to express Itself in Itself as 
Creation. Absolute Beingness manifests Itself as the Logos and 
the Holy Spirit, 'and these three are one' (1 John 5:7). 
ABSOLUTE BE-NESS 
That 
aspect of God which lies beyond the reach of human and 
Archangelic comprehension. The ultimate Source, the fathom­
less  and  inarticulate depths of  the  Divine that  are  beyond 
expression, for 'no man hath seen God at any time' (1 John4:12). 
ARCHANGELS, ANGELS 
The  Archangels are  logoic and  Holy Spiritual Beings, who 
build, govern over, and project themselves into the universes. 
Within Absolute Beingness are  Orders of Archangels, Holy 
Monadic Beings, each Order containing myriad upon myriad of 
Beings of the same kind. We know of the existence of twelve 
Archangelic Orders: Thrones, Authorities, Dominions, Princi­
palities, Overlords, Seraphims and  Cherubims together with 
others, named and  unnamed. They possess Total Wisdom, 

148 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Love, Power and Absolute Self-awareness. Angels are elemen­
tals of the Archangels. 
ARCHANGELIC MAN 
Archangelic Man is an archetype. A Holy Monadic emanation, 
on its way to the Idea of Heavenly Man, passes through the Idea 
of Archangelic Man. For this reason human beings are brothers 
to the Archangels. 
AT-ONE-MENT 
The Super Self-conscious state in which a being is able to merge 
itself in complete unity with any other being or existence, and 
with Absolute Beingness in Theosis, without ever abandoning 
its Self-conscious Ego. 
ATTUNEMENT 
Adjusting our vibrations to the frequency of any other existence 
or 
being, to the extent that we can observe and study its nature. 
Attunement is reached prior to at-one-ment. 
BEING and EXISTING 
Being is our Divine Nature, boundless and eternal. Existing, as 
the expression of Being, requires time-place-space conditions. 
Existing has a  beginning and an end and is thus a  temporal 
phenomenon. 
CAUSAL STATES 
Above the noetic state, the causal states are non-dual conditions 
of pure Love, Causes, Ideas and Principles, cared for by the 
higher echelons of the Archangelic Orders. They are also 
known as the fifth heaven and above. 
CAUSE AND EFFECT, LAW OF 
· The Law of Cause and Effect is recognized by scientists as well
as mystics. This Divine Law of growth, harmony and balance,
GLOSSARY 
149 
requires action to  result in reaction. Every deed, thought and 
emotion has a  consequence, either favourable or  detrimental. 
Karma, a  term from the East, is  the accumulation of the 
'effects'. Not limited to the gross material plane, this instruc­
tional Law can operate over several lifetimes as well as within 
much shorter periods. 
CAUSES, IDEAS and PRINCIPLES 
The Will-pleasure of Absolute Be-ness is the primal Cause. It 
is  the Cause of  Creation. From within the Will-pleasure of 
Absolute  Be-ness all subordinate causes spring. Causes then 
give rise to  archetypal Ideas. Archangels work through the 
Ideas and apply  Total Wisdom to each  form.  Every Idea holds 
within it the whole Circle of Possibility and Probabilities of the 
form to  be manifested.  Principles govern the expression of 
causes in time, place and space. 
CIRCLE OF POSSIBILITY 
Each form contains a Principle known as the Circle of  Possi­
bility. A  full embodiment of Total  Wisdom, this Principle 
delineates all the expressions of each phenomenon of life. All 
forms are continually developing: from seed to tree, from child 
to  adult. Life requires change, movement, so  that experience 
may be gathered from the many perspectives of a Circle. Each 
form changes in  appearance, though never in  nature. In  the 
Eternal Now a form is complete, with its Circle of Possibility 
already established. On entering the worlds of existence 
(material, psychical and noetical), the Circle of Possibility of a 
human being is  inscribed on the Permanent Personality. No 
form can escape its Circle of Possibility, thus ruling out trans­
migration from one fonn to  another (humans will always 
reincarnate as humans). 

150 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
CIRCLE OF PROBABILITIES 
While the Circle of Possibility is the ideal development and is 
inescapable, the Principle of the Circle of Probabilities allows 
for the halting of a developing life at any point in its expression 
in a given plane. A  seed  may  not  grow, a young tree may 
become diseased and die, or a child may pass-over (to continue 
in another dimension). Within each Circle of Possibility we find 
millions of probabilities. 
COMMON SELFHOOD 
As present-day personalities we may come into conflict with 
one another and the gulf between us may seem great, but in our 
common logoic consciousness we are unified and indivisible. 
This is what Joshua Emmanuel the Christ taught when He said, 
'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my 
brethren, ye have done it unto me' (Matt. 25:40). This is the 
Common Selfhood. In other places Joshua speaks of this: 'Ye 
shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you' 
(John 14:20) and  'I am the vine, ye are the branches' (John 
15:5). That we all share an equal place in Christ is one of the 
most profound and greatest truths. 
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, COSMIC MEMORY 
In the Cosmic Consciousness every event, past and present, in 
all the universes, is recorded and preserved. The Cosmic Con­
sciousness is  constructed of  Mind by  means of  living 
elementals in the eternal now. Contained within the Cosmic 
Consciousness is  the  Cosmic Memory (Sanskrit: Akashic
record). This is the  'heavenly archive' where impressions, 
actions, thoughts, emotions and  desires are  chronicled. By 
attuning himself to the Cosmic Consciousness a mystic can -
within the limits of his own development - study and know the 
Cosmic Memory . 
GLOSSARY 
151 
CREATION 
Manifestation of Absolute Beingness in Itself as the universes, 
from the highest heavens to the worlds of existence, in accor­
dance with Its Divine Plan. 
DIVINE LAWS 
The basic structure of the Divine Plan, governing all worlds and 
universes, and corresponding to our higher nature. Epitomizing 
Reason and  Love  manifested, it  is  our  recognition of,  and 
alignment with, these Laws (e.g. of Cause and Effect, of Har­
mony, of  Order, of  Growth and  of  Love) which lead  to 
enhanced spiritual development. 
DIVINE MEDITATION 
Divine Meditation, for lack of a better term, is believed to be the 
state prior to the Will-pleasure where Absolute Be-ness con­
templates expressing Itself within Itself. 
DIVINE MERCY 
A little understood, but most compassionate force in Creation, 
Divine Mercy permits the miraculous, the seeming exception to 
the Law of Cause and Effect, to take place. James, in his epistle, 
wrote, 'and mercy rejoiceth against judgement' (3: 13). 
DIVINE PLAN 
The blueprint of Creation, perfect and complete, accounting for 
everything and for all occurrences. Attuning our thoughts and 
actions to the most wise Divine Plan of Absolute Beingness is 
the purpose of our existence. 
ECSTASY 
Entering the Kingdom of Heavens through expansion, attune­
ment and at-one-ment. Ecstasy is of the heart as it implies a 
passing beyond all conceptual thinking.

ELEMENTALS 
Every 
thought, 
emotion 
and

creates 
and 
transmits 
an 
elemental 
- also 
called 
thought-f

- that 
carries 
on 
an exis­

of 
its 
own. 
We 
create 
and 
regenerate 
two 
types 
of 
elementals. 
When 
negative 
emotion 
prevails 
over 
thought, 
we 
have 
created 
emotional 
thought-f

or 
desire-thoughts. 
When 
our 
ideas, 
desires 
and 
emotions 
pass 
through 
reason 
and 
love, 
we 
create 
reasoned 
thought-forms, 
or thought-desires. 
An

Within 
etheric

ether is accumulated 
and distributed 
to 
various 
parts of the body. The etheric 
double 
exists as long as 
the

material, 
psychical 
or noetical) 
is projected. 
When 
a body dies (passes-over), 
its etheric

dissolves. 
EXOSOMATOSIS 
(E;cvaoμchoani;) 
A 
Greek 
word equivalent 
to the English 
expression 
'out of 
body'. 
We know of a first (from the material 
body), 
a second 
(from 
the psychical 
body) and a third (from the noetical 
body) 
exosomatosis. 
We all leave our bodies each night, during sleep, 
and travel to other planes subconsciously. 
The aim, however, 
is 
to live self-consciously 
while out of our bodies. 
FAITH 
Not 
only an individual 
or theoretical 
belief in the dogmatic 
truths of a religion, 
but an all-embracing 
relationship, 
a recog­
nition of, and love for, Absolute 
Beingness. 
As such it involves 
the 
transformation 
of our personality, 
whereby 
we are taken up 
into the whole theanthropic 
activity 
of God in Christ and of man 
in 
Christ through 
which we realize 
our Theosis. 
Faith, above all, 
is an active virtue: 
'Faith without 
works 
is dead ... ' (James 
3:26). 
FORMS 
Anything, 
in order to _exist, is created 
according 
to an everlast­

Divine 
form. There are billions 
of forms reflected 
in the 
worlds 
of existence. 
Each form possesses 
a unique 
Circle of 
Possibility, 
established 
in Total Wisdom, 
that demarcates 
its 
expression 
in the worlds 
of separation. 
The Archangels 
work 
through 
the forms to create and sustain 
the phenomena 
of life.

GROSS

The lowest vibration 
of Mind. Mind made solid to compose 
the 
three-dimensional 
gross material 
world and body. 
HEAVENLY 
MAN 
Also called the Idea of Man or the Human 
Idea. Our bodies 
are 
constructed 
according 
to the Causal 
Law of the heavenly 
human 
form. 
HEART 
CENTRE 
Not 
simply 
the  physical 
organ  but  the  spiritual 
centre 
of 
mankind's 
being. Man made in the 'image 
and the likeness' 
(cf. 
Gen. 1 :26) of  Absolute 
Beingness 
as Reason 
and Love, our 
truest Self, our inner sanctum, 
through 
which the mystery 
and 
union between 
the Divine 
and the mundane 
is consummated. 
'Heart' 
has thus an all-embracing 
significance. 
Prayer 
of the 
heart means prayer not just in the emotions 
and affections, 
but 
of the whole person. 
We should 
strive to purify our hearts for 
'God knoweth 
your hearts,' 
writes Luke (16: 15).

INDIVIDUATED SELFHOOD 
The Personality as a unified Divine Being. Selfhood encom­
passes 
all the expressions of the Self 
from Its apex as the Holy 
Monadic 
Spirit-Ego-Being filtered down to the petty present­
day personality. Within the Selfhood not a single expression is 
devalued; each is cherished in its own right.  Our Spirit-Ego­
Being 
partakes in the Will-pleasure of Absolute Beingness (to 
express 
Itself in Itself) by  expressing Itself within Its  own 
Selfhood. 
INNER SELF 
A term indicating the Self in Its expression as the Permanent 
Personality. 
INTROSPECTION 
An 
inner exploration to trace the sources of our emotional and 
noetical behaviour with the resolve to self-consciously structure 
our personality and its subconscious. The determination to free 
the self of the limitations of egoism, by releasing 'your con­
science from dead works' (Hebr. 9: 14 ), is moving towards the 
wise and loving voice of the Soul. Daily introspection, also 
termed 'looking within', is the process of  self-examination, of 
'knowing thyself'. This is the core practice of every Researcher 
of Truth and all those interested in Self-Realization. 
GLOSSARY 
157 
JOSHUA EMMANUEL THE CHRIST 
God's 'only begotten Son' (John 3:16 ). Joshua is a direct and 
pure Ray of the Logos incarnated, by immaculate conception, 
in Palestine twenty centuries ago as the 'Son of man' (Matt. 
18: 11).  His  Divine Teachings, as  preserved in  the  New 
Testament, are cherished in our work as universal and timeless, 
offering indispensable guidance in  the  exaltation of 
consciousness. 
KARMA 
see CAUSE AND EFFECT, LAW OF 
LOGOS, CHRIST LOGOS 
The Logos, the Divine Common Selfhood, is Absolute Being­
ness manifested as Super Self-consciousness. Logos has been 
translated from the Greek to mean 'Word' and 'In the beginning 
[authority*] was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the 
Word 
was God' (John 1:1). The Logos is 'the real light which 
enlightens every man ... coming into the world' (John 1:9). 
Joshua Emmanuel speaks as the Logos when he says, 'I am the 
Son of God' (Matt. 27:43), and as Joshua when He speaks as the 
'Son of man' (Matt. 18:11). 
MEDITATION 
The inner reaches of introspection become the outer reaches of 
meditation, as the  exploration moves beyond the subjective 
experience of the present-day personality, into the boundless 
oceans of the Mind, towards alignment with the universal and 
eternal. 
MIND 
Mind is the bearer of all life. Everything that exists is made of 
* The Greek word armi 
(arche) has two distinct meanings. The first, and more popularly used 
indicates a  'beginning'. The second, and one the author believes to be the real meaning, 
suggests 
'authority'. Please note that John's Gospel was originally written in Greek and then 
mistranslated into Aramaic. 

158 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Mind at varying frequencies from super-substance, substance, 
to solid matter. Mind is an emanation of Absolute Beingness 
imbued 
with the Total Wisdom, Love, Power and Purity of its 
Creator. Mind, however, is not an immortal Being, but rather 
substance 
eternally used in all Creation. Mind is Divine at its 
source, and holy in its expression. When mind is used to express 
its everyday, idiomatic meanings, it appears with 'm' in the 
lower case . 
MULTIPLICITY 
Absolute 
Beingness in Its manifold nature as gods within God. 
The 
entire diversity of Life resides within God, 'which is his 
body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all' (Eph. 1 :23). 
NOETIC STATE 
The 
mental world. A state ofldeas and unexpressed forms in the 
Eternal 
Now. From the noetic state the Archangels derive the 
forms for creating and sustaining the phenomena of life. This 
state 
is where we may come to rest in between incarnations. 
NOETICAL WORLD, BODY 
The 
five-dimensional world, and the most rarefied of the three 
worlds of  separation. In  the  noetical world  - the  world  of 
thought and home of the noetical body - Total Wisdom of 
Absolute Beingness first  finds  expression as thought-forms, 
ranging from galaxies to unicellular organisms. This is a world 
of seven planes, each with seven sub-planes. 
OBSERVATION 
Observation is part of our Divine nature. Attention without 
tension. Perfect concentration. The ability to observe in detail 
and 
to recall what we have observed is vital to our understand­
ing of the Divine Plan. 
GLOSSARY 
159 
PASSING-OVER 
A euphemism for what is commonly termed 'dying'. Passing­
over is properly understood as an episode within a Circle of 
Possibility where a personality concludes its existence in one 
dimension only to continue in  other worlds. It is in no way 
separate from life but part of it. 
PERMANENT ATOM 
That  part  of  the  Permanent Personality which records the 
experiences and lessons it has received in the space-place-time 
worlds. The permanent atom is situated in the etheric heart of 
each  body  simultaneously, and  registers emotions, thoughts, 
reactions and experiences as they occur in the worlds of exis­
tence. 
PERMANENT PERSONALITY 
The active and expressive part of the Soul, both within and 
beyond the worlds of separation. It filters knowledge to and 
from the present-day personalities and distills wisdom. 
PRESENT-DAY PERSONALITY 
A personality developed during each  incarnation, which we 
may call  'George' or  'Mary' or  whatever. The present-day 
personality is a projection of the Permanent Personality into the 
worlds of separation. This petty self, infatuated with knowledge 
resulting from the five senses, is the sum total of its elementals. 
The work of the present-day personality is to cultivate a hum­
ble, moral and loving character. 
PRINCIPLES, DIVINE 
see CAUSES, IDEAS and PRINCIPLES 
PSYCHIC WORLD, BODY 
The  four-dimensional world, also  known as  the  'world of 

160 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
emotions'. The super-sensuous psychical world is composed of 
seven planes, each having seven sub-planes. It is to the psychi­
cal worlds that we travel in first exosomatosis, in our psychical 
body, and to which, on passing-over, we first go. 
PSYCHO-NOETICAL 
The 
relationship between the psychical world (emotions) and 
the noetical world (thoughts) is  so interwoven that we need 
often to  consider them as  semi-unified. There is  scarcely a 
thought without some emotion, and in every emotion there is a 
measure of thought. 
PSYCHO-NOETICAL IMAGE 
A 
multi-dimensional image of psycho-noetical substance, 
formed through visualization by means of  noetic light. Once 
formed this elemental is everlasting, as are all elementals. 
PSYCHO-THERAPY 
The esoteric Christian concept and practice of psycho-therapy 
encompasses a complete range of healing. Not limited to treat­
ing problems within the personality, a true psycho-therapist is 
concerned with the noetical, psychical and physical well-being 
of human beings. An aspiring psycho-therapist must train him­
self in many fields: self-conscious use of etheric vitality (as the 
four states of  ether), the ability to  visualize, comprehensive 
knowledge of  human anatomy including the etheric doubles, 
understanding the subconsciousness, and awareness of Divine 
Laws. A psycho-therapist is  first and foremost a  humble 
Researcher of Truth whose effectiveness in the healing process 
(not considering himself a 'healer', but rather a worthy conduit 
for the Holy Spirit) depends on the purity of his heart and con­
sciousness. Motivated by compassion, understanding and, 
above all, love, he,values a friend in need as a Spirit-Soul-Ego, 
in the Common Selfhood, with time-place-space difficulties to 
be resolved and evolved from. 
GLOSSARY 
161 
REPENTANCE 
The Greek word for repentance, 'metanoia' (μnavma), signi­
fies primarily a  'change of mind' or 'change of intellect'. 
Repentance implies not only sorrow, contrition or  regret, but 
more positively and fundamentally an analysis of our erroneous 
ways coupled with a  resolve not to  repeat them. Repenting 
means turning our thoughts, emotions and deeds towards 
alignment with the Divine. 
SELF-AWARENESS 
A  state of  conscious awareness of the self within the Divine 
Plan. Through work and will-power we awaken from the 
slumber of  everyday consciousness into a  state of  expanded 
self-awareness. 
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, SUPER SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 
Consciousness, in varying degrees, of ourselves as individuated 
beings and existences. Through faithful introspection self­
consciousness expands into Super Self-consciousness, which is 
total awareness in  Beingness and existence also known as 
Theosis. 
SELF-REALIZATION 
The culmination of life experience in the worlds of separation. 
At the point of  Self-Realization, the present-day personality, 
transmuted into the Permanent Personality, unified with the 
Self-aware Soul, is prepared to assimilate with the Spirit-Ego­
Being in Theosis. 
SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
A  primary Nature of Absolute Beingness: complete Abun­
dance, Blessedness and independence of all needs. 
SOUL, SELF-AW ARE 
When a  ray of a  Holy Monad passes through the Idea of 

162 
THE ESOTERIC PRACTICE 
Heavenly Man, a Soul is. The Soul is not created; it is the pre­
cious 'pearl' of Spirit (Matt. 13:45, 46). The incorruptible Soul, 
which St. Paul called the 'Spiritual Body'(l Cor. 15:44), is in 
a formless state as Spirit, yet retains the human Idea. When 
returning to  the  Godhead, the  Soul  marries the  Spirit-Ego­
Being in a state of Super Self-consciousness, as the bride mar­
ries the bridegroom (cf. Matt. 25:1-13). 
SPIRIT-EGO-BEING 
Our Self as a Divine Being: boundless, eternal, and immovable. 
Our  Spirit-Ego-Being is  the  Self  as  Holy  Monad, Super 
Self-conscious and  luminous, in  at-one-ment with the  Self­
sufficiency and Multiplicity of the Godhead. The Will-pleasure 
of Absolute Beingness to express Itself within Itself is identical 
with the Will of our Spirit-Ego-Being to express Itself in Its own 
Selfhood. 
SUBCONSCIOUS 
Researchers of Truth understand the triadic nature of their sub­
conscious. One chamber of the subconscious contains all the 
elementals composing our personality. The second chamber is 
the storehouse oflife-giving etheric vitality. The third, and most 
valued chamber, is that of the Logos and the Holy Spirit. 
SYSTEM FOR THE RESEARCH OF TRUTH 
Our system of esoteric Christianity celebrates the eternal truths 
known 
to all great religious traditions, while firmly based in the 
teachings
(
of the God-Man Joshua Emmanuel the Christ and the 
New Testament. Through directed study, exercises and medita­
tions, we seek the balanced evolution and integration of our 
entire being, as we cultivate our moral, ethical, spiritual and 
mystical aspects. Our approach is  methodical, safe and 
self­
evident 
GLOSSARY 
163 
THEOSIS 
At-one-ment with  the  One  God,  Absolute Beingness. The 
moment when  the Prodigal Son,  now Super  Self-conscious, 
returns home to his most loving Father. 
TOTAL LOVE, WISDOM and POWER 
Primary Natures of Absolute Beingness and all Beings. Form­
ing a sacred triangle, each Nature depends on the other in order 
to be properly expressed. 
VISUALIZATION 
Visualization is a  language of  the  Divine, the  'key'  to  the 
kingdoms (Rev. 3:7). After learning to observe carefully and to 
concentrate fully, we gain the ability to visualize consciously. 
We shape etheric vitality to create elementals, from psycho­
noetical images to  entire scenes. Through visualization, in 
healing work, we learn to materialize and de-materialize. There 
is nothing more powerful than thought, and visualization is the 
process of harnessing thought in a constructive manner for the 
expansion of the self and to aid others in need. 
WILL-PLEASURE 
Absolute Beingness expressing Itselfin Itself as Creation. The 
Will-pleasure, in  Greek euareskeia (EvaQEaX£La), carries a 
sense of pleasure derived from bountiful giving, as practised by 
a 
warmly generous and  wealthy source. God's pleasure in 
creativeness. 
WORLDS OF SEPARATION 
The three worlds of existence (material, psychical and noetical) 
in  which we  spend  our periods of  seeming separation from 
Absolute Beingness. These are worlds of duality, of space­
place-time, which we experience during each incarnation.
