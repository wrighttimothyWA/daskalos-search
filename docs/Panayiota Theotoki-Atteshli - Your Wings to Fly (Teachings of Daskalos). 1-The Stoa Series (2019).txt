FOREWORD
T
HIS book is dedicated with reverence to the holy memory of my 
father and Teacher. It is a personal account of my most intimate 
and spiritual memories regarding my father, Dr. Stylianos Atteshlis, 
also known as ‘Daskalos,’ our Master or rather our Brother-Guide, as 
he  used  to  call  himself.  It  includes  a  selection  from  his  private  and  
confidential  lessons  conveyed  to  me  throughout  the  years  we  lived  
together.
When you take up this book, as a seeker, one important task is to 
get  to  know  your  present-day  personality  in  depth,  to  purify  it  and  
then  to  assimilate  it  with  your  real  Self,  the  Permanent  Personality.  
What  will  your  gain  be?  You  will  be  able  to  express  the  powers  of  
your real ‘Inner Self’ through your present-day personality, which is 
now purified and cleansed. 
It is a big mistake to think that in doing so we may acquire psycho-
noetical powers. We will not gain anything we do not already have!
Then what? We will simply make our present-day personality a 
vehicle  for  the  expression  of  our  true  ‘Inner  Self.’  Then  we  will  be  
developing the powers we already possess. What powers? To become 
masters  of  matter,  masters  of  etheric  substance-matter,  masters  of  
psychical  super-matter  and  noetical  substance,  and  then  masters  of  
materialisation and dematerialisation. 
My father explained to me that although this is not easily achieved, 
neither is it unachievable. 
This  is  the  principal  purpose  of  our  life.  This  is  the  reason  we  
descend  into  the  Material  Worlds!  Why  do  you  think  we  were  born  
in  a  material  body?  We  came  on  this  planet  in  order  to  know  our  
material body, govern it and live as a phenomenon of Life. Why else? 
Why have we been born in this material body? We are here so that one 
day we may hear after a hard workday, “Well done, good and faithful 
servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler 
over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord” (Matthew 25:23). 
Therefore, first we have to become masters of our ‘home’, of our 
material,  psychical  and  noetical  bodies,  and  their  etheric  doubles.  
We  have  to  know  how  to  blend  and  unite  them  so  that  they  work  

15
in a harmonious way as one. We have to learn how to make Etheric 
Vitality our ‘Daily Bread,’ so as to attain a perfect balance. 
It  will  be  easier  to  express  these  powers,  once  we  know  who  we  
really are. Then, we will find that we are not poor and weak creatures, 
with  various  insignificant  time  and  place  insurmountable  problems  
we think we cannot overcome. We will see that in reality most issues 
are  unimportant.  Christ  quoted  the  Old  Testament  saying,  “Ye  are  
gods; and all of you are children of the most High” (Psalm 82:6).
The Self we will find as the God within us, this is what we have 
to  express  –  our  real  Self.  For  this  God,  nothing  is  impossible  and  
unachievable.  If  we  know  and  believe  in  His  power,  which  means  
if  we  have  faith,  we  will  tell  a  mountain  to  move  and  it  will  move!  
Matter is ready to obey us if we are its master, but if we are its slave it 
will not obey us, it will consume us.

PREFACE
D
r. Stylianos Atteshlis (1912-1995) – also known as Daskalos – was 
a  Greek  Cypriot  mystic  and  healer.  Daskalos  is  the  Greek  word  
for  teacher.  He  was  born  on  December  12,  1912,  on  the  island  of  
Cyprus, where he spent most of his life. He was married to Anastasia, 
a schoolteacher and had two daughters, my younger sister Irene and 
myself, Panayiota. 
Daskalos  was  educated  in  Cyprus  and  Britain  (St.  Andrew’s  
University) attaining a Doctor’s degree in Philosophy (on June 17, 1960) 
and a Doctor’s degree in Divinity (on July 28, 1961). He was honoured 
with  the  Pearson  Gold  Medal  for  his  doctoral  thesis,  ‘Via  Crucis,  
Doloris,  Pestis,  Restitutionis  que’  -  ‘The  Way  of  the  Cross,  Pain,  
Pestilence (Sorrow) and Reinstatement.’ He also gained a Master’s degree 
in Divinity (on January 15, 1960), in Metaphysical Science (on January 15, 
1960) and in Psychotherapy (on August 21, 1959), as well as a ‘Research 
Extension  Fellowship’  from  St.  Andrew’s  University  in  London  (on  
September 20, 1959). 
My  father  could  speak  and  write  twelve  languages,  including  
three  dead  or  extinct  languages  (Aramaic,  Sanskrit  and  Egyptian  
Hieroglyphics).  He  also  enjoyed  composing  and  performing  music,  
playing the violin and the piano, writing poetry, painting, gardening 
and studying languages. He is the author of a number of books. His 
numerous  paintings  are  infused  with  his  unique  symbolic  painting  
style. 
Daskalos  pursued  a  career  in  the  Cyprus  Government  Printing  
Office. However, he was known for his teachings. He had been teaching 
for seventy-five years, trying to lift people from their spiritual slumber 
hoping to kindle the Divine Fire in their hearts. He was always ready 
to help and heal wherever and whenever it was needed.
He founded a system based on Esoteric Christianity, named ‘The 
Research after the Truth.’ He also used to teach in a small room next 
to our house in Strovolos, called the ‘Stoa.’ A series of books based on 
his  practice  and  meditation  have  been  published  in  Greek,  English,  
German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese. 
If  we  were  to  contain  his  teachings  in  a  few  words,  they  would  
have to be 
‘Unconditional Love, Wake-up and Freedom.’

“Be the master of your thoughts, feelings and emotions; and not 
their  slave!  Reduce  the  egoism  of  your  personality,  love  God  and  all  
Human  Beings.  This  is  a  prerequisite  and  a  solid  foundation  for  a  
healthy  and  happy  life,”  he  used  to  say.  Smiling,  he  added,  “Those  
who attend the lessons should study the lectures, learn from them and 
retain what is good in order to improve their lives. They should not see 
their teachers as masters or gurus. We have to be our own masters.”
When people called him ‘Healer,’ he would reply that no Man can 
claim to be a healer. The only Healer is Christ. We have to feel that it 
is an honour to be a good instrument in the hands of the Christ Logos 
and the Holy Spirit. People from all over the world would travel to the 
Stoa, in Strovolos, to hear his lectures and seek healing. 
Daskalos passed over at the age of 82 in Cyprus, on August 26, 1995.
Daskalos is the author of the following books:
The Parables and Other Stories (1991)
The Esoteric Teachings - A Christian Approach to the Truth (1992)
The Esoteric Practice - Christian Meditations and Exercises (1994)
The Symbol of Life - Das Symbol Des Lebens (1998)
Joshua Immanuel the Christ - His Life on Earth and His Teaching 
(2001)

REMARKS
D
ASKALOS  followed  the  age-old  perennial  tradition  embraced  
by  Masters  of  the  Wisdom,  where  Esoteric  Truths  were  orally  
conveyed  as  a  spontaneous  outpouring  from  Higher  Realms.  As  he  
himself said, “Have you ever seen me carrying a paper?”
During the final years of his cycle of life on Earth, Daskalos felt 
the need to publish some of his teachings in writing. Yet, his lessons 
were mostly presented orally to students during lectures at the Stoa in 
Strovolos and at other gatherings in Cyprus and abroad.
In view of the above, the reader should bear in mind, that much 
material  in  this  volume  has  been  transcribed  from  the  vast  body  of  
lessons that were recorded live at the time they were given.
Throughout the book the first letter of some key words is written 
either  as  a  capital  or  in  lower  casing.  For  example  ‘Life’  denotes  
the  Nature  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness,  whereas  ‘life’  represents  the  
manifestation  of  Life  as  a  phenomenon  in  the  various  Worlds  of  
Existence in time and space-place. The same applies for other words 
like: Is-is, BE-ing - being, Man-man, Ego-ego, Self-self, Mind-mind, 
State-state,  Light-light,  Nature-nature,  Consciousness-consciousness,  
Motion-motion, Form-form, Personality-personality, Fire-fire, Water-
water  etc.  When  a  word  begins  with  a  capital  letter,  this  denotes  a  
higher  Divine  State.  Whereas  the  mundane,  or  that  which  is  under  
the influence of the egoism of the present-day personality appears in 
lower casing.
 The   concepts   of   Self-awareness   and   Self-consciousness   are   
synonymous and are used interchangeably.
 Absolute  BE-ingness  God  or  ‘The  Absolute  BE-ingness  God’  is  
referred to as ‘It’ and not as ‘He’ or ‘She.’ Absolute BE-ingness and 
any of the other expressions used for God are without gender. God 
is all and everything.
 The term ‘Subconscious’ is used to denote the condition we harbour 
in  our  present-day  personality,  whereas  ‘Subconsciousness’  is  the  
subconscious state of the Mind. 
 The  question  mark  is  occasionally  used  to  prompt  the  reader  to  
deeper analysis and reflection.

19
 The  King  James  Version  (KJV)  of  the  Holy  Bible  has  been  used  
throughout the book for all Biblical references. All quotations are 
in italics. 
 Our  System  for  the  Research  after  the  Truth  employs  terms  and  
concepts in a particular way. To avoid confusing our terminology 
with that of other schools and other disciplines, and to gain clarity 
over  the  material,  we  refer  the  reader  to  the  ‘Glossary  of  Basic  
Terms’ at the end of the book.

PROLOGUE
M
ANY years ago, following the unacceptable behaviour of some 
so-called  ‘students,’  my  father  decided  to  call  his  lawyer  and  
make his will, leaving the entire work and teachings of his lifetime to 
me. This incident was a repetition from his previous life. Nevertheless, 
in  this  incarnation  he  was  not  deceived  by  those  who  were  aiming  
to appropriate his life’s work by taking it unlawfully into their own 
hands. This time he did not allow anyone to blind him. He placed all 
into my hands, as he had wished to do in his previous life. It was not 
his intention to neglect the rest of our family, but he saw at the time 
that I was the only person able to protect and preserve his teachings 
and work. Later, when my time comes to move on to other dimensions, 
I will entrust my father’s work, as well as mine, to my family.
Twenty-four  years  have  already  passed  from  the  time  that  God  
called  my  beloved  father  back  Home.  Many  friends  have  asked  me  
to write a book about my life with him. I have experienced so many 
things and learnt so much from him. As you can understand, it is not 
possible to fit them all into a single book. So, I have decided to write 
this first volume hoping that Divine Providence will allow me to live 
a few more years to write down the experiences I had with my father. 
I want to dedicate this book to my beloved husband Charalambos, 
who  has  stood  by  my  side  for  fifty-eight  years.  It  is  also  dedicated  
to my family and to the few true friends who came into my father’s 
life and my life, and made it more beautiful. For me, they are unseen 
heroes;  they  came  and  learnt  from  my  father,  and  now  follow  his  
example by serving, loving and helping their fellow Human Beings. 
I  am  eternally  grateful  to  them  because  they  did  not  come  merely  
to  acquire  as  much  knowledge  as  they  could  from  him,  and  then  to  
vanish abruptly abusing my father’s teachings. 
Years ago, I remember that my father said to me, “If you manage 
to  have  one  real  friend  in  your  life,  you  must  consider  yourself  the  
richest person in the world.” I am happy to say that I have managed to 
have not only one, but many. Can you imagine how blessed and rich 
I am?

Your Wings to Fly
Y
ou may wonder why I have chosen this title for my book. I will 
explain  by  telling  you  a  story.  One  evening,  many  years  ago,  
my  father  was  giving  a  lesson  to  the  members  of  his  group  at  our  
house, in Strovolos. They were sitting in the big living room listening 
to  his  teachings.  All  the  other  rooms  were  located  around  this  big  
living room. One of these rooms was the bedroom I shared with my 
sister Irene. I was then about nine years old and my sister two and a 
half years younger. That evening my mother put us to bed, before the 
arrival of the students.
However,  that  night  I  decided  not  to  sleep,  but  secretly  to  listen  
to what my father was teaching. I hid behind the door. When all the 
students  were  gathered,  my  father  welcomed  them  and  started  the  
lesson.  It  was  about  out  of  body  experiences  or  ‘Exosomatosis.’  Of  
course, at that time, I knew nothing about this matter. I just listened... 
After some time, I felt tired and went back to my bed, but not to sleep. 
Out of interest and awakened curiosity, I wanted to try to do what I 
had heard my father teaching the students.
I lay on my bed and relaxed my body. I observed everything around 
me and tried not to think or feel anything. Then, I closed my eyes and 
I started to breathe the way he had instructed them. Suddenly, I felt 
something was leaving my body and I found myself up on the ceiling, 
but without a body. Looking down, I saw my material body lying in 
bed. I was surprised, but soon I saw that I was moving in the air from 
one corner of the ceiling to the other. For me, it was like a game. 
A little later, I felt that I must return to my body. Still when I tried, 
it was not possible. I tried once more but to no effect! I was so scared; 
in fact I was petrified! I started screaming but no sound came out of 
my  mouth.  Suddenly,  I  felt  a  hand  slapping  my  back,  and  I  found  
myself in my body again. I opened my eyes and saw Father above me. 
It seems he had heard me and had come to my rescue. He warned me, 
“Do not dare do such a thing again!”
Of course, he knew that I would try it again, so he confessed to my 
mother,  “I  will  shut  down  her  consciousness  so  that  she  will  not  be  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
24
able  to  repeat  it.”  I  overheard  him  and  felt  so  sad.  I  went  back  and  
forth to school, refusing to eat or talk to anyone.
My parents discussed the matter and Father invited me to his study 
to talk. He looked at me, he smiled and said, “I know that you want to 
learn. I will take you with me but you must follow my instructions. I 
do not want you to do just anything that comes into your head.” From 
that moment on, my training had started...
A few years later, during one of our spiritual journeys, I heard him 
saying to me, 
“And now my Eagle fly!”

Reflections
B
ELOVED Father! I look upon you, resting serenely on this human 
bed  of  suffering,  patiently  abiding  your  time,  while  my  eyes  
tenderly caress your loving features. Beloved face, a serene and gentle 
presence in all my moments throughout life, since that cold November 
night when you gently picked me up in your hands and welcomed me 
into this world. Never have I felt closer to you, than I do now. Your 
presence fills me with tender sentiments, and yet at times, you become 
so distant! When you withdraw into your impenetrable silence, cold 
foreboding grips my heart...
As a Human Being, dearest Father, I am rendered helpless before 
your silent suffering; I am unable to ease your physical discomfort. All 
I can offer you, is my infinite love and a helping hand in your difficult 
moments. My infinite love? What is my love compared to the love you 
have  offered  me  and  the  whole  wide  world?  You  have  taught  us  the  
meaning of unconditional love and what life is; what real Life is! 
Memories rapidly succeed one another...
Blessed was the night when the first person to take me up in his 
arms was my father, known to all as Daskalos. “Fly, my dearest love, 
your Spirit and Soul are free! Nothing can hold you back; this is just 
your personality! You were, you are and now you exist! Give meaning 
to  your  existence  and  may  you  ever  be  blessed!”  I  imagine  these  to  
have been your words and thoughts when you first embraced me.
How  can  a  simple  touch  be  so  impregnated  with  meaning!  
A  caress,  a  loving  look  in  my  father’s  eyes,  expressing  an  ocean  of  
words. And yet, these seemingly simple gestures contain the wisdom 
of God! This miracle does exist, I know! A father like this is a god in 
the eyes of his child. How I wish everyone could experience the love 
of a father like mine, feel the soft strong hand that still guides me, see 
that understanding look giving me courage... But what am I saying? 
Doesn’t this father rightfully belong to all? Isn’t he everyone’s spiritual 
father?

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
26
As I grew up, I began to wonder whether one of my father’s fervent 
wishes was that I become a mother to the weary people in this life; but 
listen and care for them; embrace them with my hands and eyes; try to 
ease the burden in their hearts; to remove the loneliness in their lives 
and make them understand that a genuine friend does exist for them 
in this world. Though people may not know, many are the guides in 
the other worlds, readily awaiting to assist in our moments of trial.
My childhood was one long celebration! Both my parents seemed 
to  me  as  bright,  shining,  heaven-sent  angels  to  protect  me  and  my  
sister on this earthly paradise; a paradise, which much later, I was to 
learn people could turn into a living hell for themselves and others. 
My  happiest  days  were  up  to  my  fourteenth  year,  in  which  time  I  
was a carefree, happy adolescent busy learning and discovering new 
things. I can vividly recollect all those times when I would fall asleep 
listening to my father playing the piano or the violin. These were the 
times I would contentedly curl up in his arms to listen to music with 
him. He was such a wonderful dancer too! To my young eyes he was 
a perfect giant. I felt so tiny before him! He would make me stand on 
the tips of his shoes and then holding me, we danced together attuned 
to the music, which was often mingled with my mother’s gay laughter; 
a bubbly brook of joy imprinted in my mind forever!
At the time, I did not know that living with my father would be 
one constant lesson. Oh, the first play-like flight he gave me! What an 
experience! My father leant over, picked me up and swung me into the 
air, landing me on his strong shoulders! There I sat breathlessly holding 
on to his thick black curly hair! Then, we would go on our favourite 
walk  to  the  hill,  a  little  beyond  our  house,  where  we  sat  and  talked  
for hours; he, telling me his wonderful stories while I picked flowers 
for Mother. On these walks I pestered him with endless questions. He 
would look at me and smile, patiently explaining everything I wanted 
to  know.  He  taught  me  to  smell  the  air  and  how  to  distinguish  the  
various scents and perfumes in the flowers. There, I learnt to pick out 
the different bird songs, to listen to the hum of the bees, even to detect 
the flutter of butterfly wings! I could sit so still that I felt the Earth’s 
vibrations or the tiny, minute sounds of the sprouting buds. He taught 
me to respect life in all its expressions and forms, the divine gifts of 
God.

WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
Sometimes  he  wanted  a  few  moments  of  rest  and  would  quietly  
sit asking me to do the same. Not understanding his need for peace, I 
continued to buzz in circles around him laughing and singing happily. 
“Quiet Dearest one, come and sit beside me awhile.” He was never 
angry with me, but there were times when he needed quietude for inner 
reflection. Then, he would look at me in tender love, and immediately 
I would calm down and sit docilely at his feet. Gentle was the sleep 
that so often kissed my eyelids. On returning home, how strange, the 
food  and  water  at  supper  tasted  so  much  sweeter!  Probably,  it  was  
because I was happy or was it because I was with my father?

teachings from September 1952. It was built personally by him with the help 
of a few friends, and it has a perfect northern orientation, in alignment with 
the electromagnetic currents of our Earth.

I  loved  to  sit  in  his  study.  Father  would  be  busy  writing  at  his  
desk,  while  I  studied  my  lessons.  He  always  stopped  to  help  me,  if  
I  needed  it.  I  remember  that  he  enjoyed  geography  and  especially  
drawing maps with me. He could draw so well! Father always liked to 
show me how to mix colours while listening to music, interrupting at 
times to attract my attention, “Listen Yiota dear, listen well..., feel the 
music. What do you see?” I could never understand what music could 
have to do with colours!
Life at home with Father was complete harmony, and my hours of 
study with him were so enjoyable as we talked and laughed, travelling 
all over the world to fantastic places on our maps! Sometimes Mother’s 
voice would surprise us, “Come, food is on the table, and your meal is 
getting cold.” But we were far away on our imaginary travels...
Life  with  one’s  parents  can  strongly  influence  a  growing  child’s  
character, and reflect as a negative or a positive attitude in later life. 
Family life in my parent’s house was one of security. The love, warmth 
and tenderness we experienced, conquered every childish fear in the 
hearts of my sister and myself. Peace and love reigned.
I was a good student at school, and I wanted Father to be proud 
of  me.  I  can  recollect  my  last  day  at  elementary  school  which  was  
an award giving day; I would be rewarded and complimented on my 
performance for the school year. My father was sitting in the audience 
among  the  other  parents  watching  me  and  wearing  that  ambiguous  
smile of his, one of pleasure or content. Or perhaps was he laughing 
at the whole situation? When the ceremony was over, I jubilantly ran 
over to him triumphant with my award.
“Father, did you hear what they said about me?” I asked proudly. 
“Hmm...”  he  smiled  taking  me  in  his  arms  and  kissing  me  on  the  
forehead. We walked home. He seemed thoughtful all the while, as if 
wanting to say something, but not knowing how to or more likely not 
wanting to hurt me, trying to find the right words to touch a child’s 
heart.
“What  are  you  thinking  of  Father?”  I  asked  him.  He  turned  and  
looked  at  me  sweetly,  and  I  shall  never  forget  his  words,  “Dearest,  
take care! If you give heed to the flattery of the world you will never 
see your faults. You will think that whatever you do is right. It is very 
dangerous. Be your own judge. If you need to judge others, which you 
shouldn’t, do it with kindness and love, never egotistically. The same 

29
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
applies for your own self.”
He picked out one of the books I had been awarded saying, “These 
other books will help you later on in life, but this one here is the Bible. 
It is your very life! Its every word must be your guiding light on your 
path to salvation. ‘Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life.’ He is in 
you, always! Remember, people will love you and hate you according 
to their criteria. Do not be pained and shed no tears, do not judge and 
above  all,  hurt  no  one!  The  light  of  His  Light  will  shine  upon  you  
always showing you the way, guiding and protecting you in life.”
What wise words! They touched me deeply! Even though I was a 
child, I understood him profoundly.
At  times,  I  rebelled  inside  me  at  everything  Father  said.  Being  
independent  by  nature  as  a  child,  I  preferred  to  follow  my  own  
unrestrained way.
One  would  call  me  stubborn  and  strong  willed  even  today.  It  is  
still with an effort that I contain my surplus energy; I often feel able 
to penetrate everything around me with my eyes. I enjoy nature, and 
prefer the sports that require courage and dexterity. I do not tolerate 
betrayal or deceit, nor do I forget. I like my friends to be honest, serious 
people with reasonable aims and ambitions.
Father was careful to respect my need to be alone with my thoughts, 
especially after my mother’s death. He never tried to impose his will 
on me. He never broke a promise, nor did he in any way deceive me; 
but  he  showed  his  admiration  for  my  ‘strength  of  character,’  and  
surrounded me with love and care in those difficult years.
I  remember  the  time  when  the  local  priest  accused  my  father  of  
being a heretic. He had arranged it so as to deny my father the right 
to baptise a child. I was furious! Then on better reflection, I decided 
to write him a letter, which naturally I never sent. This is what I had 
written:
Dear Reverend Father,
It is with the greatest surprise and bitterness, that I learnt 
of  your  unjustified  accusations  against  my  father.  Surprise,  
because as a representative of The Most High I never expected 
such  grave  charges  and  bitterness.  His  ‘anti-Christianity,’  as  
you call it, cannot be judged only by the number of times one 
goes to one’s parish church.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
30
As   you   must   already   know,   our   dear   mother   was   
prematurely called away to God. Not only did our father not 
yield to this unexpected tragedy, but has become for my sister 
and myself our constant guardian angel, guiding our footsteps 
to the Lord on the path of virtue, altruism and self-sacrifice. A 
father like ours should become a symbol, and not a subject of 
rejection and scorn! But then again, the saying of Christ in an 
ecclesiastical hymn of the Holy Week is well known, “I was 
offered bile instead of manna!”
Through your intervention you have denied my father an 
act of mission because to lead a child to the sweet religion of 
Jesus of Nazareth, the religion of love, is an admirable act of 
God.  Nevertheless,  you  have  bestowed  upon  your  Holy  Self  
the  unbecoming  title  of  ‘Intolerant,’  a  title  undesirable  for  a  
‘Representative of the Most High!’
Please note that your act does not dishonour my father, as 
you would perhaps most like to, but calls into question your 
ability  to  become  the  good  shepherd  of  the  flock,  which  the  
Church  has  entrusted  you  with,  and  obstructs  your  pastoral  
duty.
Contrary  to  your  opinion,  Father  fulfills  his  duties  well  
both to God and his neighbour. But if it were in fact otherwise, 
in  other  words,  that  Father  did  not  indeed  go  to  church  
services or visit the monasteries as you say, then your sacred 
duty would be to lead the ‘Lost Sheep’ back to the flock, as one 
that  has  strayed;  back  to  sweet  Jesus,  and  not  to  banish  and  
persecute him in this way!
It  is  obvious  that  one  acts  according  to  his  feelings  and  
education, nothing more.
My father is not aware of this letter, so please let us keep 
this between ourselves. Let us say that my decision to write to 
you is one of confession to my parish priest; the confession of 
one of God’s embittered children.

Guiding through Love
A
T  an  early  stage,  I  realised  that  Father  possessed  something  
that others could not comprehend. Once I asked him why some 
people feared him while others loved him, why many sought him out 
wanting to be near him, and yet others avoided him. 
Smiling, he kissed me and said, “Dearest, people always fear what 
is stronger than themselves, and hate whatever they do not understand. 
They  do  not  realise  that  all  these  powers  I  possess  are  also  within  
them. It is God’s gift and everyone’s rightful inheritance. You see, long 
ago  people  misused  these  gifts,  but  God  never  withdrew  them,  only  
allowed them to remain inactive until the time to come in the future 
when mankind will learn to use them correctly once more, and only 
with God’s blessing. Then, when people are ready, they shall have no 
fear because they will come to remember what they already know.”
How  can  people  judge  someone  they  do  not  know?  When  they  
have no knowledge of his personal life and his life’s work? How can 
they  criticise  someone  without  knowing  that  which  his  immediate  
family knows?
Our week at home would start with Father bringing us breakfast 
in bed, whilst singing to us, his little loved ones, in order to wake up 
and drink our warm milk. He would get us ready and take us to school. 
At  lunch  time  he  picked  us  up  from  school  and  took  us  home.  My  
sister Irene and I, would drop our schoolbags in our room, wash our 
hands and rush to table where lunch was served. Father never failed to 
say the Lord’s Prayer before each meal. After finishing our lunch, we 
would go on a little walk. There he asked my sister and me how our 
day at school was. Then, back to the study for homework and games! 
In the evenings, after supper, we went into Father’s study where he 
sat on his large green leather armchair. He tapped his hand on his leg, 
and getting the message I would jump up onto his lap, then tapping 
his other leg my sister would do the same. This was storytelling time, 
which lasted until we fell asleep in his arms. Sleep there was so sweet, 
so  sweet!  It  was  only  later  I  realised  that  those  stories  were  taken  
from  the  Old  Testament.  Sometimes  he  related  humorous  stories  as  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
32
examples of correct behaviour and right attitude, most impressive to 
our young minds.
Father  was  never  angry  with  me,  nor  did  he  ever  spank  me.  
I   remember,   Mother   would   be   very   upset   whenever   through   
thoughtlessness  I  did  something  to  hurt  another  child,  or  when  
I  played  childish  pranks.  When  she  heard  of  it,  she  scolded  Father  
saying he never reprimanded me enough, but allowed me free rein to 
do as I wished. Father, smiling at her understandingly would say, 
“Let me be Anastasia, I know how to bring this child up.”
And turning to me, he crooked his finger in his familiar way in my 
direction saying, “You, come here now.” I thought, “Aha, now I am in 
for it,” but instead he tapped his leg, and there I found myself sitting 
on  his  lap.  In  my  childish  way  I  thought  that  Father  had  gone  mad;  
instead of spanking me as I deserved, he was now telling me stories! 
Patiently  he  went  on  with  his  story,  and  every  now  and  then  asked,  
“Do you understand? Do you see now Yiota?” Gradually, I would see 
the  meaning  of  the  story,  learning  from  the  example  and  realising  
that it had to do with my behaviour. I would put myself in the leading 
part, and through it understand myself! I could tell whether I was the 
‘good guy’ in the story or the ‘bad one’ who hurt and annoyed people! 
Then slowly, I would lower my head in shame. When the story was 
over,  Father  would  hug  me  and  kiss  my  head,  “Do  you  understand  
now,  my  child?”  My  child!  What  a  lovely  word!  “Yes  Father,  please  
forgive me, I shall never do it again,” and I never did.

33
Christmas Time
I 
always   remember   Christmas   time.   With   each   approaching   
Christmas,  my  sister  and  I  would  be  filled  with  anticipation.  Our  
parents,  secretly  whispering  together,  filled  our  minds  with  vivid  
fantasies as to what the conspiracy was about! It was a happy occasion 
when we accompanied Father to Nicosia to choose the Christmas tree. 
It was usually so tall, that it took up all the space in the corner of the 
room, with its top bending over as it touched the ceiling. The fragrance 
of the newly cut tree was everywhere, and Christmas carols filled the 
air. Father then gathered the Christmas decorations and placed them 
on the table. 
We  watched  as  he  chose  each  piece  with  care,  knowing  exactly  
where to place it. We looked on, wondering what difference it made 
where each piece went. “Just hang a piece here and one there,” we told 
him, “No!” he said, “we have to be careful. It is very important. You 
cannot  put  this  big  star  here  in  the  middle  for  example,  you  must  
place it on the very top... you have to put this coloured ball here and 
this colour there, the little manger here at the bottom... some cotton 
wool for snow like this... and the little electric lights to twinkle in the 
dark...” He taught us to meticulously observe every little detail. As in 
life, each was equally important. When he had finished, we sat on the 
floor and listened while Father told us stories of Christ.
The  Christmas  atmosphere  was  always  vibrant,  yet  tranquil.  
Mother enjoyed being in the kitchen baking and cooking the various 
dishes for the occasion, with my sister Irene helping out as best as she 
could.  I  never  liked  being  in  the  kitchen,  but  preferred  to  read  with  
my father. I used to sit reading my books and he his. Sometimes, from 
time to time, I stopped to steal a glance in my father’s direction, and 
then lose all sense of time as I observed him. The expressions on his 
face spoke louder than words! If he did not agree with something he 
was reading, he frowned and sometimes exclaimed aloud, “Just look 
at this! Look at what they are writing!”

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
34
Other times he smiled, his face portraying exactly the same words, 
but in a different manner. I spent hours analysing his face, the passing 
expressions, the humour on his lips... Sometimes, something would 
bother his nose, and he would rub it absentmindedly as he pondered 
over what he was reading, or he would scratch his forehead in concern 
over something, as if he found it disturbing. I would be lost watching 
this  mute  form  of  communication.  He  would  look  up  and  see  me  
reading, or he would pretend not to be looking at me; but I could see 
the tenderness in his eyes well enough, it was as if they were saying, 
“My dearest hope and dearest joy of my life.” Joy of his life!
My sister Irene, up to mischief in the kitchen, would come running 
towards  the  safety  of  Father’s  arms  with  mother  chasing  after  her.  
Father would hug her protectively from his wife’s wrath. “It’s alright 
Anastasia,  it’s  alright;  she’s  just  a  child,  just  a  child...”  But,  Mother  
was upset, “In the end that child will not leave me a single dish in one 
piece or a single cup!” “Never mind, it’s not worth the trouble to spank 
the child for a dish.” How could one spank the joy of his life for a dish!
Christmas  Day  would  finally  arrive  and  we  went  to  church.  
Returning  home  hungrily,  we  would  find  that  Mother  had  the  table  
set and ready. We were a happy family at table. Sometimes my sister 
complained  over  her  food.  Father  kindly  pointed  out  how  fortunate  
she was, and begun one of his stories about children who did not have 
the joy of a family like us, or food enough to eat as we did. As children 
we imagined he was telling us yet another story. How true could it be! 
Children  are  the  joy  of  one’s  life,  the  hope  of  the  future!  How  could  
they  be  hungry!  They  are  the  Kings  and  Queens  of  this  world;  such  
was our childhood world. Both Father and Mother tried to shelter us 
from life’s ugliness, but this was not possible for long. Sooner or later, 
we  would  have  to  witness  the  truth  for  ourselves,  but  never  to  the  
point  of  misery  as  others  unfortunately  have.  When  I  grew  up  and  
heard a friend of mine recounting his pitiful childhood years, I could 
not believe the extremities of life. How can it be possible, how can it 
be true! But it is, and very much so! I realised then how lucky I have 
been.

35
Youthful Rebellion
F
ROM my early youth, Father taught me always to protect and help 
my fellow Human Beings. This could be both a good and a bad 
thing. I, myself, by nature, tend to be over protective. I love to express 
my feelings and love towards others, to run to their assistance, to care 
and help them even at personal cost. 
Sometimes I would get upset with my father, “But you taught me 
so, it is not right! It is not fair to be taken advantage of! Why should I 
always be the one to run to everyone’s assistance, why should I always 
have to do everything! Why should everyone think I am strong! I want 
to  be  able  to  feel  weak,  and  have  others  to  do  things  for  me  too;  to  
have someone to lean on, why not? One cannot give forever. Whatever 
happens or whatever people do to you, why should you have to repay 
them in goodness when they treat you badly, and you know they are 
taking  advantage  of  you?  Surely  they  will  take  you  for  a  fool!  They  
will think you are stupid! They will not think it is because you are a 
good Christian! They will just say, ‘Oh, go to her or him, they will help 
you because they are mad!’”
Such were some of my discussions with Father. I kept losing my 
temper with him. We had so many similar ‘discussions’ when I grew 
up, so many! His placid air would make me angry. Though I knew he 
was right, I felt I had to contradict him! I had to find something wrong! 
Those calm eyes and that tranquil face, succeeded in exasperating me! 
He  was  ever  so  calm;  nothing  could  disrupt  him  in  any  way.  “Don’t  
you  ever  get  angry?  Aren’t  you  human?”  He  smiled  once  and  said  to  
me, “If as a Human Being you want to be angry, always remember to 
say this prayer...”
Praise to the Lord Almighty.
Peace on Earth and good will to all men.
Praise to the Lord Almighty,
To the Almighty that reigns within us now.
Peace on Earth, the Earth that is within our hearts.
May peace always reign there.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
36
Yet,  I  was  stubborn.  I  had  my  views  and  wouldn’t  change  them.  
People take advantage of your goodness anyway! I kept on... I would 
get so angry.
How  many  times  had  we  not  talked  these  things  over  and  over,  
ever  since  I  was  a  child?  I  would  plague  him  with  questions,  like  
“What  is  God?  Who  are  we?  Where  do  we  come  from,  why  do  we  
hurt?”  Especially  when  we  lost  Mother  I  thought  God  was  so  cruel!  
“Where is His justice? What have I done to deserve this? He destroyed 
everything in my life in a moment!” I thought I would never come to 
terms with myself, even though I had a father like my own. I was so 
bitter for so many years, even with my mother! “Why did you leave 
us? You abandoned us now when I need you most!” 
And  I  even  turned  in  resentment  accusing  God,  “Where  are  You  
now in my hour of need! I need you! I cannot see you! All I can see is an 
unjust God! A cruel God! My father says that You are a merciful God, 
a God of compassion and love... Where is this God? Or is this God just 
for my father!” Because my God was very different at that time!

37
Fairytales
F
ATHER would always tell me a story. It was not until much later 
that I realised it was the same story, only that the characters would 
change  as  I  grew  older.  As  a  child  the  story  mimicked  the  style  of  a  
fairy-tale, as a teenager it was adapted from the Old Testament, and 
later  from  real  life,  and  still  much  later  on,  from  the  realm  of  the  
Highest  Truths.  So  I  often  told  him,  “I  cannot  understand  all  this  
philosophy,  make  it  plainer.”  “It  is  plain,”  he  would  say,  “you  just  
cannot see it! Look at it from this side, from the other, from the top and 
the  bottom...!”  But  then  again,  I  did  not  understand  what  he  meant!  
Now, I know very well what he was saying... Of course, I am not on 
the same spiritual level as my father, nor do I wish to be. Each one of 
us  has  his  own  personality.  I  am  gradually  improving,  and  through  
his lessons I have learnt a great deal. Now, whether I am able to apply 
them is another matter! Still, I try. There are many years yet to come.
As my father always loved to say, “We have all eternity ahead...”
Naturally, I wish to learn as much as possible in this life. I want to 
do such a lot. However, the main thing for me now, as I see my father 
fatigued by the weight of the years he has lived through on this planet 
in this life, is that I would like to be able to do something for him. 
“How I wish I could do something for you Father, if only I could 
have the powers humanity had so many years ago, to be able to perform 
one tiny miracle, to see you well again! Putting aside the centuries that 
weigh upon you..., what wouldn’t I give to see you well again?” I can 
see the answer in your eyes.
“No,  Dearest  one.  I  do  not  want  anything  from  you,  my  life’s  
cycle is almost over. Yet, do not ever think it is the last. 
We shall be 
together again!
”

A Sad Birthday
T
ODAY, this day of my birthday, I sit here beside you holding your 
hand.  A  faint  smile  plays  upon  your  lips,  as  you  prepare  to  fall  
asleep.  Looking  back  over  the  years  with  you,  there  is  so  much  to  
remember.  What  can  I  possibly  say  when  words  are  inadequate  to  
express  my  feelings?  You  taught  me  so  much  Father,  but  never  yet  
how this material self of mine should bear this cross of suffering! I can 
almost hear you whisper in my ear, “l have taught you, but you did not 
listen to me. Embrace this cross with love and say, ‘Thy will be done,’ 
and you will see how much lighter it will become!”
But  Father,  this  tiny  self  of  mine  feels  anger  and  frustration  at  
what is happening around me and within me. I hurt. I hurt so much!
Your favourite music soothes my ears evoking so many memories 
of beloved ones departed from this life and of others that live on in 
my heart, but are far away. I need them now. Why should Dear God 
allow us to endure pain for years, and waste precious moments of our 
earthly life? I need your light Father, now!
Again,  I  hear  you  saying,  “What  is  this  lifetime  compared  to  all  
eternity?” But then again, our eternity here on Earth is but a moment 
in time for God the Father...
I ask you how you feel, and you smile at me. In how many past 
lives have I seen this smile, and who knows how many more yet...?
I see everyone around you; they think they know what is best for 
you...
They all think they can help, but what can they know? What do 
they  know  of  your  needs  Father,  now  that  you  are  on  your  sickbed?  
“How little they know,” you seem to say.
Inside  me  I  feel  you  do  not  want  help  from  anyone,  I  sense  that  
you want to leave us... I can vividly feel Mother’s presence here beside 
you, when I see you smiling as you cast your eyes around the room. 
This is the only time I beg her to leave!
“Leave us Mother... go away... Do not take him with you!”

39
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
I know it is selfish on my part. Perhaps this is your real desire, to 
leave  us  and  go  to  her!  Maybe  we  are  the  ones  holding  you  back  by  
wanting to keep you near us...
Here  beside  you,  I  listen  to  your  breathing  as  it  becomes  lighter  
at  times  and  then  again  heavier,  causing  me  moments  of  pain  and  
frustration. I seem to hear you say, “My Circle of Possibility is almost 
completed, my existence is almost over,” and I remember you telling 
me, “You must know that BE-ING is one thing, EXISTING is another 
and MOTION something else; they are three different things. BE-ING 
is eternal. It is different to EXISTING, which has a beginning and an 
end. MOTION means progression through a Circle of Possibility and 
Probabilities; from its very beginning to its very completion, from the 
moment of our birth until the death of our material body.”
I remember one of our numerous walks to the hill, when I was a 
child, you talked to me about the Pulse of Life:
“Today  you  must  understand  as  best  as  you  can  the  meaning  of  
the Pulse of Life. You must detect it and observe it. You can study it 
in the phenomena of Life. This Pulse of Life is the expression of your 
gross material body. You can find it in your very heartbeat and in that 
of every living form. You can see it as respiration and expiration in all 
forms of Life. You can see it in the trees every time a bud bursts forth 
to  give  us  branches,  green  leaves,  blossoms  and  fruits.  You  can  see,  
too, the Pulse of Life all about you in space everywhere; in the light, 
in the sunrays that flood the open space before us, which we call the 
horizon. We can hear the Pulse of Life in the sound of insects, in the 
singing of the birds. We see it and observe it everywhere! 
It is everything we see and hear! 
I have been telling you about the phenomena of Life, but the Pulse 
of Life is both cause and phenomena, or rather the result of cause and 
this is where you must place all your attention! It is not enough to just 
look and study the phenomena, which are the expression of this Pulse 
of Life, but you must be able to penetrate into the cause; the Cause of 
the Pulse of Life.
My  dear  child,  wherever  we  turn,  we  will  see  this  Pulse  of  Life  
behind all phenomena, which in themselves tell of the Total Wisdom, 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
40
Love  and  Power  of  God’s  Will-Pleasure  and  Will-Power.  What  is  
there  behind  all  phenomena  of  Life?  What  is  this  Pulse  of  Life?  Do  
you know? It is actual Life itself! Because, in order to have the Pulse of 
Life, we must have Life!
We can also see the Pulse of Life in the Static State of the Absolute 
BE-ness. In this Divine State, we understand the Pulse of Life as being 
something apart from what we call motion, vibration and frequencies 
of  vibration.  What  is  more,  we  can  perceive  the  Pulse  of  Life  just  
before it even becomes the expression of the phenomenon of Life in 
two conditions: As the bearer of both the Law of Cause and the Law of 
Effect; its characteristics now being motion and an endless repertoire 
of  frequencies  of  vibration.  Subsequently,  we  find  the  Pulse  of  Life  
in  the  Material  World  around  us  in  flawless  cooperation  with  other  
Divine Laws; for example, the Law of Gravity, the Law of Attraction 
and many others, which you will learn more about as you grow older,” 
he said smiling at me.
I  asked  Father  what  the  difference  was  between  BE-ing  and  
Existing.  He  told  me  simply,  “BE-ing  is  without  beginning  or  end,  
this is the Divine Law and Nature of BE-ing. Existing means whatever 
exists  and  is  born  within  a  given  space-place  in  the  Absolute  Space  
(Nature-State)  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness,  and  within  time  in  the  
Infinity-Eternal  Present.  It  has  a  beginning  within  time  and  space-
place, a culmination and an end, according to the Law of Possibilities 
and  Probabilities.  It  is  motion-movement  in  time  and  gives  us  the  
relevant meaning of time as past, present and future.”
“What is Mind, Father?” 
“God’s  Will-Power  created  Mind,”  my  father  replied.  “There  is  
nowhere in the infinite Universe where we do not see Mind, which is 
not the Nature but the expression of the Absolute BE-ingness. Mind 
is  not  God!  Mind  is  the  means,  by  which  everything  was  created;  
the  Universes  and  the  Gross  Material  World  are  expressions  of  the  
Absolute BE-ingness.
The concentration of Mind is called creative ether. Man will regain 
the use of creative ether sometime... As you see around us, even with 
the  slight  use  of  the  creative  ether  that  we  have  in  our  power  in  the  
Material World, we have such wonderful phenomena! Imagine what 
man would be able to create with the proper concentration of Mind!

WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
So,  now  we  have  the  meaning  of  Mind,  which  as  we  have  said  
mankind misused in the past. Therefore, this power had to be taken 
away as humans became destructive by making bad use of the creative 
ether, for the sole satisfaction of their selfish means and ends in the 
phenomena of Life in the Gross Material World.
Look at the people around us; see how many of them use the Mind 
–  the  Mind  Super-Substance?  How  do  they  use  it  constructively  in  
their lives, both within their own present-day personality and within 
the Gross Material, Psychical and Noetical Worlds as noetical images, 
in order to live happier lives? Whatever has become, becomes and will 
become a phenomenon of Life, derives from the magnificent World of 
Causes and Laws. All noetical images are conceived by the Holy Mind, 
as  Ideas,  Principles,  Concepts  and  Meanings.  In  reality,  this  refers  
to  the  process  of  materialisation;  the  shaping  of  Mind  into  noetical  
images, psychical vibrations and eventually gross matter.” 
“What exterior influences affect us, Father?”
“The powers of influence act in accordance with the conditions of 
one’s environment. Man exists on planet Earth in this Solar System, 
and  we  have  the  Sun,  the  comets,  the  planets  and  their  satellites.  
Therefore, you see that conditions are created according to our specific 
Solar System,” Father replied patiently. 
“If  in  the  Solar  System  of  our  Galaxy  there  were  twenty-four  
planets, would their influence be the same as it is now on our planet? 
No, dearest, they would be completely different. So, we can say that we 
are influenced by the conditions and circumstances of our environment. 
I am not referring merely to the immediate environment, but to that of 
the whole system. You must realise that influences are dual; they can 
be both beneficial and harmful, not to say catastrophic! 
Let  me  give  you  an  example.  Look  at  the  Sun,  for  instance.  We  
know its principle influence upon us is that of the triad of light, fire 
and  heat  at  various  stages  of  manifestation,  which  is  governed  by  
Divine BE-ings such as the Archangel Michael (Ma-Kha-El) and other 
‘Invisible Powers,’ as our Church calls them. Light, fire and heat bring 
forth  Life  in  all  the  phenomena  in  living  forms,  as  in  Man  and  in  
all other kingdoms: vegetable, mineral, animal and all life contained 
in the sea... Consequently, the source of life of all phenomena is the 
Sun! Therefore, I regard the Sun as something creative, its creativity 
spreading  within  the  Solar  System.  In  this  instance,  I  am  bearing  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY

witness to the Sun’s creativity, but if I overexpose myself to the Sun, 
what happens? I get sunstroke! Or in intense light I will be blinded! 
Thus,  parallel  to  the  beneficial  effect  of  the  Elements  we  also  have  
their destructive or harmful energy.”
“So for example, we have the Sun as fire, heat and light,” he said 
smilingly,  his  infinite  tenderness  flooding  me,  “but  quite  similar  to  
it on Earth is fire in the form of combustion. But when we have the 
appropriate  vibrations  that  cause  combustion,  we  will  then  witness  
the  Sun’s  harmful  nature.”  He  stopped  to  give  me  time  for  it  all  to  
sink  in,  “So  you  see,  Yiota,  dear?  You  do  like  to  bombard  me  with  
questions, don’t you?”
“Yes! Does it matter? I want to learn!”
“Of  course  you  do,  but  what  I  am  telling  you  now,  you  are  too  
young to be able to understand. As you grow up... oh, but we have so 
much time ahead.” 
“Fine,  Father,  but  now  I  have  another  question  for  you.  I  want  
you  to  tell  me  what  the  connection  between  the  subconscious,  the  
conscious and our emotions is.”
“Aha,”  he  said  slowly  savouring  the  question,  “a  fine  question...  
What   is   the   connection   between   our   subconsciousness,   our   
consciousness  and  our  emotions...  Hmm,  I  have  told  you  about  our  
etheric double, and I have said that by means of the etheric double of 
our  material  body  we  have  different  expressions  of  the  phenomena  
of  Life,  of  the  world  around  us,  of  motion  and  of  the  ability  to  see.  
And then again, how do we see? I see a hill, a tree..., and as we have 
said, sight belongs to one of our five senses; it creates an elemental, a 
noetical image.” 
“Yes, but what does the noetical image do?” I interrupted.
“We continuously create noetical images, and we store them in the 
part of ourselves (I shall not name it) where our memory is created. 
Memory is just the surface of the ocean of Mind – our Mind. Mind 
exists to its very depth and that includes everything within it, all of 
which will eventually reach the surface in a gradual pace.”
“But  where  is  it  located?  Is  it  in  our  material  body?  Is  it  in  our  
etheric  double?  Where  is  what  we  call  the  subconscious,”  I  asked  
impatiently. 

43
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
“Our  subconsciousness,  or  rather  our  subconscious  Mind  is  not  
located at a specific site, but is to be found in every atom, every cell or 
organ of our gross material body and in every molecule or centre of 
energy of our etheric, psychical and noetical bodies. You may as well 
conceive of subconsciousness as the depths of the ocean of our Mind. 
As we have said on another occasion, subconsciousness is the dwelling 
of the sum total of these elementals or various types of noetical images 
that compose our present-day personality...”
“Yes, correct, yet...” I wanted to interrupt again.
“Indeed, this sum total of, let us call them ‘building blocks,’ that 
we  harbour  in  our  subconsciousness  derive  either  from  our  present  
lifetime or from the distant past of our previous incarnations that are 
conveyed to our present-day personality via our Permanent Personality 
Self-Aware  Self.  All  this  amalgamation  of  elementals  attached  to  us  
constitute  the  ‘backbone’  of  our  present-day  personality  self-aware  
self.  It  is  with  these  so-called  elementals  or  noetical  images  that  we  
engrave our present-day personality. All these clusters of elementals 
or ‘building blocks’ are the same in nature, yet their type only differs 
as  to  their  individual  vibrations  and  intentions.  Still,  in  order  to  
express  this  newborn  present-day  personality  we  are  in  need  of  the  
connecting cement and the plans to erect this ‘building.’ Definitely, it 
is not enough to merely collect the ‘building blocks.’ Metaphorically 
speaking,  we  cannot  build  unless  we  use  steel,  cement  and  other  
materials or attributes that are:
(a) Our  Free  Will  and  the  Will-Blessing  of  our  Divine  Father  to  
come forth and manifest as the Archangel Man, the One who 
has  descended  from  Heaven  and  who  is  destined  to  return  
back.
(b) The  divine  gift  of  the  ability  to  form  and  project  the  Mind  
in  all  the  multi-dimensional  Universes,  bestowed  upon  all  
Human Beings.
(c) The  constant  work  of  the  Pan-Universal  Christ  Logos,  the  
Holy Spirit, the Seven Archangels residing in our bodies and 
personality  and  of  our  Guardian  Archangel,  that  sustain  our  
Hypostatic  Expression  in  Creation.  This  ability  derives  from  
our Hypostatic  Nature  to  manifest  our  Spirit-Self  dressed  in  
bodies or vehicles of expression in all the Universes.

44
Nevertheless,  these  elementals  live  in  the  unfathomable  depths  
of the oceans and remain there, and cannot be seen from the surface. 
Yet,  they  are  never  lost,  as  they  live  in  our  subconscious.  It  is  up  to  
us  to  bring  these  elementals  to  the  surface  of  our  every-day  waking  
consciousness at will, to revive them from the past, so that we may work 
with ourselves in the present. However, in the untrained personality 
they  may  often  surface  on  their  own,  demanding  our  attention  and  
thus deplete our energy. The conscious control over elementals is an 
important part of our esoteric work.”
“I have told you,” he continued, “that we do not only store these 
so-called  noetical  images,  but  also  whatever  surrounds  them.  The  
noetical image is not only made up of Etheric Vitality of the etheric 
double  of  our  material  body,  but  from  its  surface  and  the  power  
contained  within  it,  it  is  able  to  gather  and  disseminate  the  energy  
required  to  revitalise,  sustain  and  maintain  itself.  Where  does  this  
noetical image draw its energy from? This noetical image has to draw 
its energy or Etheric Vitality from somewhere. This is what gives it its 
quality. 
Let  us  see  now  what  happens  in  Man.  Let  us  say,  we  have  this  
particular person in his normal everyday environment. All that concerns 
him is his fascination for lovely cars. Already the appropriate image 
has been formed by him; the one that gives the general impression and 
meaning  of  a  vehicle.  Colour  and  brand  are  included  in  this  image.  
Seeing all these cars moving around, he begins to want one himself. 
‘Ah,’  he  says,  ‘this  is  the  car  I  would  like  to  have.’  This  then  gives  
him the urge to create a specific noetical image, the noetical image he 
desires. Consequently, desire is the force, which builds and keeps the 
noetical image alive, in existence! In his mind he may create two or 
three different things that he wishes to have. All these are energised by 
the force named desire. We therefore see that the ‘heart’ of the noetical 
image is desire, and its ‘brain’ is thought. 
We  have  said  that  we  have  two  types  of  thought-forms  or  
elementals,  as  they  may  also  be  called.  All  human  elementals  are  
composed of both desire-emotion and thought. Depending on which 
is  the  predominant  constituent,  they  can  be  either  desire  thought-
forms or thought-desire forms. 
Now, I want you to pay close attention. Man, in his subconscious, 
daily builds desire thought-forms, and one desire succeeds the other. 

45
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
Here,  desire  is  the  backbone  of  the  noetical  image.  Nonetheless,  
just  how  much  thought  does  it  contain?  Only  enough  to  realise  its  
purpose, and quite often no thought at all, and this is the difficult part! 
It then becomes impossible to be realised in the Material World and 
so, from that moment on, it enters our subconscious. So, in this way 
consciousness recesses into subconsciousness.”
“Consciousness?” I asked. 
“Well  yes,  as  it  was  consciously  seen  and  consciously  desired.  
Now,  how  do  we  realise  this  thought-form?  It  must  definitely  pass  
through the subconscious where it was ‘built’ or given its structure by 
the subconsciousness, and make its way through to the state we call 
awareness; in other words to consciousness!
When desire rules the noetical image then thought succumbs into 
fulfilling the purpose of the desire in whatever manner is necessary. 
Thought in this instance, being weaker than the desire is unable to be 
of service, and therefore the quality of the noetical image is not clear. 
This is called a desire-thought form elemental, and accounts for the 
kind  of  daily  elementals  that  people  create  most.  However,  when  a  
person creates the type of elemental we call a reasoned thought-form, 
desire  becomes  secondary,  and  the  need  for  reason  principal.  Quite  
often it is need and reason, which make us create these thought-forms. 
So,  we  must  know  what  it  is  we  desire,  what  we  want  and  how  
to  ask  for  it,  and  then  we  shall  get  it!  These  thought  elementals  are  
more  powerful  in  comparison  to  desire  elementals,  and  tend  to  be  
realised  much  earlier  and  more  quickly.  Consequently,  it  is  to  our  
definite advantage that we create reasoned thought-form elementals. 
We  need  to  strive  toward  the  right  and  correct  manner  of  thinking,  
and gradually learn how to build them well and to actually see them 
as being realised!”
“Oh Father! I feel dizzy! There is so much I have to learn! I have the 
impression that there will not be enough time!”
A faint moan brings me back to reality. Seeing you there sleeping 
on the bed a single word comes to mind and takes hold of my being; 
LOVE and immediately I remembered another time when talking for 
hours together I suddenly asked you:
“What is love Father?”

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
46
“Hmm,”  smiling  you  looked  at  me  and  softly  responded,  “What  
sort of love are you referring to? Are you talking about Total Love or 
earthly love; love on the material plane, as humans call it, the egoistic 
expression of a purely time and place existence? You cannot compare 
these, can you?”
“How can I comprehend Total Love, where do I begin? So, when 
we say Love what do we mean?”
“Certainly not that, which an ordinary person calls love; taken from 
his own experiences and expressed in the terms of egotism under the 
prism of his egoism. Light-love then ‘loses’ its light, but nevertheless 
there is still something left behind the expression of Light. I cannot 
disagree with this, but then I would call this love-light instead. Still, 
I should not come to know real Light through the reflexion of light!
You  will  have  to  search  deep  within  you,  in  order  to  find  love,  
and  so  to  arrive  at  Total  Love.  In  the  same  way,  you  must  penetrate  
the  so-called  force,  in  order  to  arrive  at  Total  Power.  You  must  also  
enter into – not the knowledge of or the experience of – but the Soul 
Itself,  in  order  to  find  what  the  Nature  of  this  Self  same  Soul  Is.  In  
other words the Truth! And when you find the Truth you will find and 
understand what Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total Goodness are. 
You will then realise through the Truth what possible meanings these 
Holy States can have in time-place terms in the worlds of the different 
dimensions.
If  then  you  compare  this  to  what  people  call  love,  power  and  
wisdom,  you  will  see  a  great  difference!  Believe  me  it  is  so  utterly  
immense!  You  will  see  then,  their  so-called  power  as  being  nothing  
more than conceit and weakness; their so-called love as the different 
stages of the expression of egoism; and so-called goodness as nothing 
but varying degrees of discontent, of what is surely the egoism of the 
individual personality. So take care!
Never ever imagine that you may become a real assistant healer, if 
you wish to call yourself such, unless first your heart does not become 
a beacon of Truth and Love in the world; if your heart does not radiate 
forth real LOVE! When you are alone I would like you to think this 
over and meditate on it. I want you to see the various differences in the 
meaning of love according to people’s interpretations and intentions. 
You will see that no two people’s perception coincides. Also, I want you 
to see, really see, what real Love is for you and what it means to you.

47
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
Love,  as  Man  sees  it  through  the  lens  of  the  self  of  his  or  her  
present-day personality and egoism, differs greatly from one person 
to the next. Do you know that in one thousand people never will two 
individuals  perceive  love  alike;  so  profound  is  the  difference!  Never  
will they all see, express, or feel it in the same way. Only through the 
Christ Logos will equal comprehension be achieved, and then again, 
when someone asks you what Love is you will be unable to answer in 
words! Perhaps no one will be able to describe it because there is no 
human expression capable of describing this wondrous Holy State! 
Take care you do not remain in stagnant waters or attach yourself 
to  time-place  things  around  you.  Let  your  meditations  and  right  
reasoning turn you to higher states within you, towards the ultimate 
Light of Truth, of Love, of Life. Ask your Inner Self, your Self-aware 
Soul, for enlightenment and you shall receive it!”
It would go on for hours like this, me sitting wide-eyed in wonder, 
listening  to  all  that  my  father  revealed  to  me  in  his  patient  loving  
way, with the solemn intention of being understood by the eager child 
before him. His all-encompassing tenderness made of me a devoted 
pupil!

48
Grandfather Panayiotis
N
OW  and  then  when  Grandfather  Panayiotis,  my  father’s  father,  
would visit us, you could see this tall, lean man turn in concern 
towards my father, “Let the child be, what are you telling her? Leave 
her in peace; she is not old enough yet. She should be out running and 
playing, enjoying herself at this age... You can speak to her when she 
is old enough to study!”
Ah  Grandfather,  dear  Grandfather!  How  different  he  was  to  my  
father. Yes, Father was gentle and sweet, full of life but calm and so 
tall! Grandfather was the military type, slim-built, tall with eyes that 
lit up and flashed whenever he spoke of the times when he was young 
serving in the British army. Everything was so unreal when he spoke 
in  this  manner,  punctuated  by  his  vibrant  gestures  and  demanding  
presence.
Grandfather  would  often  tease  me  saying,  “You  are  my  first  
grandchild. Of course I would have preferred a boy, but never mind! I 
will call you my Tomboy! I want to teach you so many things, tell you 
such a lot... but first you must grow up! I want you to be strong!”
Father would burst in, “No, I do not want my child turned into a 
soldier!” and Grandfather would answer, “Well I suppose you would 
like her to be soft as yourself, no doubt!” 
It was comical to watch these two men, who loved me so much, 
‘fighting’  over  what  each  in  his  own  mind  thought  was  best  for  me.  
Perhaps this is what helped me in later life, seeing how Grandfather 
had lived his life and how Father his. I so often feel them both inside 
me. The one, hard and strong, who knew everything; how to act and 
behave in life and society, always sure of himself. The other soft and 
tender, mild by nature... Two contradictory sides contained within the 
same person, me.
I often remember when we sat at the table. Grandfather would sit 
beside me watching me discretely, observing my manners, seeing if I 
held my knife and fork correctly, whether I spoke politely and made 
sure I would wait my turn to be served. If I tried to add something that 

49
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
was out of place, he would cast me a stern look as if saying, “It is not 
your turn to speak, you are too young, let the grownups have their say.” 
Looking at him, I would shut my mouth, smile, and await my turn. 
Many times when the meal was over, he would draw me aside and take 
me to see his closet, which he always kept under lock in his room. 
“Come, let me show you,” he would say. “What is it Grandfather?” 
“I want to show you something very important. Something from the 
past.”
He  opened  the  cupboard  and  slowly  pulled  out  the  drawer  with  
great reverence. He withdrew a scroll of paper covered in signatures 
from the King of England. 
Taking out a medal he would look at me gravely and say, “This is 
in recognition of my services to the country because I fought on the 
side of England. They bestowed this title on me, which rightly passes 
on to your father and then on to you, his first born. You are the end 
of the line. I want you, when it is time, to be proud of it and keep this 
safe in your possession.”
“But,  Grandfather,”  I  laughed,  “You  were  fighting  in  the  battles,  
not me! You fought in the war, what did I do? Nothing! I did not do a 
single thing to deserve it!” 
“No, rightly so, but it is so you will remember me; to remember 
that your grandfather faithfully served this country.” 
“Well, but it’s not our country.” 
“No,” Grandfather said, “when you grow older you will understand. 
Eh, for me, England is sort of my country...”
“Yes, but I am Greek, I have no English blood or German like you. 
I...”
“In reality you do have, but if you feel Greek, it’s alright with me,” 
he added laughingly, and we would look at the scroll and talk about it 
as equals. We would laugh, chat and walk together in the garden sitting 
under the huge palm tree. There, I would sit and listen to his stories; the 
stories of his life. It was amusing to see this elderly man leading a child 
by the hand, talking and explaining all kinds of things that quite often 
were beyond its understanding. Nonetheless, I loved to listen to him so 
much, to look into those blue eyes reminiscent of the heavens; so clear 
and blue they were, so different to my father’s brown eyes.

Grandfather  would  tenderly  pick  me  up,  embrace  me  by  the  
shoulders and smilingly say, “How I wish you were a boy, how I wish 
I could live to see you in the army!” 
I laughed, “Yes, Grandfather, me too. I’d love to go to the army, but 
of course not as a soldier!” 
“No, no, of course not! A general at least!” he would laugh.
I  would  naturally  agree  with  him.  Father  would  watch  and  
smile condescendingly, obviously not approving of this kind of talk. 
Whenever  he  reproached  us,  Grandfather  interrupted,  “Stop,  I  am  
talking to my granddaughter, you can go into the kitchen and make 
yourself a cup of coffee!” 
“Oh, so,” Father would say, “but she’s my daughter.” This infuriated 
me,  “Stop  you  two  this  instance.  Stop  arguing!  I  do  not  belong  to  
anyone, I belong only to myself!”
Now  having  grown  up,  I  often  ask  myself  if  we  really  belong  to  
ourselves? At times I come to think that someone else is in control, and 
it is quite beyond our means. In fact, here beside my father, I am often 
engulfed in this thought, but of course, now I understand something 
greater  by  far.  After  a  certain  age,  although  we  cannot  claim  control  
over our material body, I sincerely believe that we can learn to control 
our real Self. 
Father, when I see you now trying to move in your bed, I remember 
the time we were in Brazil for your lectures. Walking together in the 
gardens, I would loose myself and walk on ahead. You would call me, 
“Yiota dear, slow down! The Spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is 
weak...”
In other words, his body cannot keep up with his flight of spirit any 
longer; it carries the heavy burden of its 82 years. Eighty-two years! I 
wonder  Father,  if  I  ever  reach  your  age,  will  I  have  your  brilliance  
of  mind  and  spirit?  Will  I  have  your  endurance,  your  patience,  this  
peaceful look? I know I have yet a lot to do and a long road ahead, but 
I promise that at every step of the way I shall look upon and listen to 
all that you have taught me; all that you have shown me will guide and 
shower my path with light. It is so difficult always to do what must be 
done, but I shall do my best, my very best. I promise!

An Intimate Communication
S 
ADNESS overwhelms me today, as I reflect upon what is happening 
to my small country; the injustice and pain that is dispersed about 
like a disease-spreading wind. Whenever feelings like this overcome 
me, I head for the cemetery. I arrange the flowers and light the candle, 
I care for the grave and sit myself down. I know Father is not there, his 
soul and spirit are departed, but his loving remains rest there in peace, 
so I seek whatever comfort I can and settle down beside him. There, in 
confidence, I talk to him in my own way, unburdening myself of the 
weight in my heart. I tell him everything that takes place, wanting my 
father with me as of old, when he would talk and comfort me, easing 
the grip on my heart. I await, secretly knowing what he has to say to 
me. And yet again I pause and listen. For what? Is it the sound of the 
wind in the trees or is it his loving voice? Yes Father, I am listening. 
Our silent communication begins...
“Dearest one, you must be strong and prepared. Be always ready 
and  watchful  to  help  those  who  will  ask  of  you  and  our  circles,  
the  ‘Source  of  Life.’  I  say,  ‘Source  of  Life’  because  what  kind  of  life  
is  this  that  people  have  today?  Most  are  no  better  off  than  animals,  
submerged  in  uncertainty,  anxiety,  pain  and  misery,  hatred  and  
confusion! Therefore, be in readiness. ‘The harvest truly is great, but 
the harvesters are few’ (Luke 10:2). They who should be of service in 
the vineyards are killing each other; the wolves are ravaging the sheep 
and the shepherds are fighting amongst themselves! You must be alert 
and  attentive,  but  calm  and  serene,  never  wishing  to  represent  any  
earthly authority whatsoever. Remember, ‘My kingdom is not of this 
world’ (John 18:36).You must be a light on the troubled road of men, 
and an outstretched hand ready to support those that are stumbling. 
Be the warm embrace that comforts the sorrowful, ever ready to wipe 
away the tears and the blood from their wounds.
What  will  you  need?  Certainly  knowledge,  which  I  shall  give  
you. Immeasurable knowledge! Your heart will become a sun of Love 
shining from within with ‘The true Light, which lighteth every man 
that cometh into the world’ (John 1:9), as our Most Beloved Jesus said. 
‘By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
52
to another’ (John 13:35). Take note of this point. 
You  have  enough  theoretical  and  practical  knowledge,  but  if  
you wish to advance you must get to know your Self as a Permanent 
Personality; your real Soul-Self Eternal BE-ing, your real Self in time-
place expression. Thereon, gradually, you shall enter the Kingdom of 
the Heavens within you. To more fully express yourself! What greater 
joy  can  there  be  than  the  delight  of  discovering  the  Truth  and  the  
Reality of what concerns the true Nature of one’s real Self?
There will come a time when you will find out what one is as Love 
and Life, Eternal Life and Self-awareness, or more correctly, as Self-
aware  Theosis;  because  that  is  where  the  end  of  the  road  leads  to!  I  
know that you are aware of the fact that Man is an Eternal BE-ing; the 
Permanent Personality Self-aware Self. Furthermore, I have taught you 
how to study your present earthly time-place expression of yourself, 
which is also endowed with special Self-awareness. What we now call 
our  present-day  personality  Self-awareness  is  nothing  but  a  name,  
with  desires,  weaknesses,  thoughts,  ambitions,  passions;  a  suffering  
personality, which many accept as their real Self. 
What is more, you must now be able to distinguish your Self as 
master  of  the  conditions  of  life,  a  real  Self-awareness  in  Truth  and  
Light, from that of the confused self, bewitched by the charm of the 
material; the earthly ambitious striven self that is but a mere shadow 
of the Self. What else but a self carrying a name in a material body, 
with  desires  and  thoughts;  an  entity  subject  to  continuous  change!  
Now,  this  present-day  personality  must  be  transmuted  to  your  real  
Self. How can this be achieved?
Only when you have carefully studied the present-day personality, 
which you shall regard as the ‘shadow’ of your real Self. In other words, 
an  entity  that  is  not  entirely  apart  from  your  Self,  but  which  is  not  
your Self either. Its behaviour neither binds you to it in any way nor 
taints you, but obliges you to purify it and guide it with the ultimate 
purpose  of  its  transmutation  to  your  real  Self!  When  transmutation  
occurs, you will then come to feel your actual real Self; a purified Self-
aware  personality!  The  present-day  personality  will  then  no  longer  
be  a  rebellious  noise,  the  one  who  disputes,  torments  and  lies,  the  
one  who  in  fact  has  inflicted  all  the  suffering  upon  its  self.  For  it  is  
now a crystal-clear mirror in time-place upon which the Permanent 
Personality is clearly reflected!”

WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
Our  present-day  personality  is  a  mirror  that  takes  for  granted  
anything  reflected  upon  it  as  being  its  real  Self.  What  do  we  see  
reflected so far? Just material things! Look at the people around you; a 
name that was given at birth, the image of our material body... What 
else?  Your  ambitions,  desires  thoughts,  weaknesses,  fascinations,  a  
total of desire attractions, in other words, a confusion, total chaos! A 
mass  of  energy  we  call  the  subconscious.  As  we  have  said  up  to  the  
present,  this  mirror  regards  itself  as  that  which  is  reflected  upon  it,  
and becomes one with what appeals to it.
Just  examine  your  present-day  personality.  Are  you  not  the  sum  
total of your desires? Many call these desires aims or aspirations. They 
just cover them with the name they bear today, and surround them with 
the gross-material image they recognise as themselves. Saint Paul, the 
Apostle of Nations said, ‘I die daily,’ and truly, we do see people daily 
shedding their desires, thoughts and aims, only to replace them with 
new  ones.  The  spell  of  material  enchantment  is  hard  to  break,  and  
constantly inspires new desires. These desire-attractions become like 
the terrifying monster Hydra of Lerna, which was able to regrow every 
severed head with two new ones!
Desire in Man was once formed in response to necessity. If we search 
our subconscious, we will find that the need for survival has always 
existed  and  can  still  be  traced  nowadays  in  every  living  organism  
as  an  instinct.  Regarding  the  Human  Being  living  as  a  present-day  
personality  self-aware  self,  we  realise  that  this  vital  and  protective  
mechanism  is  indispensable  for  the  survival  in  the  Material  World.  
I would even call it blessed and holy, but it has now largely become 
an evil expression, an enslaving desire, a blind purpose in darkness 
and  ignorance,  seeking  to  possess  the  personality  that  harbours  it.  
Man  has  become  engrossed  in  matter,  bound  by  profane  conditions  
that attract and intoxicate him, rendering his present-day personality 
irrational.
It  is  vital  that  you  begin  to  analyse  all  these  conditions  that  
will  emerge  from  your  subconscious  –  that  part  of  your  Permanent  
Personality Self-aware Soul in its Total Wisdom and All Knowingness. 
This  self  introspection  shall  lead  you  to  discover  what?  That  there  
is  no  need  for  our  subconsciousness  to  find  out  anything.  It  is  fully  
aware that only by examining everyday situations, there will come to 
light that which the ‘shadow,’ our present-day personality, must learn!

It  is  then  when  all  our  thoughts  and  desires  will  be  under  close  
supervision,  as  will  our  aims  and  goals;  then  our  life  will  be  in  
complete harmony with the Divine Law. That is what you must do my 
child.”
Involuntarily  a  question  rises  to  my  lips,  “How  am  I  to  help  all  
these  people  I  see  floundering  in  their  problems?  I  am  on  my  own  
father...” 
“Never regard all these people, your fellow Human Beings, as ever 
being less than yourself. No one born of man is higher than the Son of 
God, Jesus Christ the Most Beloved, the Almighty Logos that became 
flesh  and  was  assimilated  into  the  material  body  and  personality  of  
Jesus Christ. He stooped and washed the feet of his apostles, including 
those of Judas who was soon to betray Him. He bathed and kissed the 
dirty feet of everyone! You must regard every Human Being as He did. 
Love  and  help  all.  No  one  is  lower  nor  are  you  higher.  Within  each  
and every one is the Divine Spark, ‘The true Light, which lighteth every 
man that cometh into the world’ (John 1:9).
The Pan-Universal Logos dwells within all these people causing 
them to develop their individual Self-consciousness. Our material body 
is the temple of God in which our Self-aware Soul as our Permanent 
Personality dwells. All Men are the same BE-ings, off-springs of the 
Absolute BE-ingness, the Christ Logos and the Holy Spirit, sharing a 
common Nature as Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total Love.”
Total Love... I have a look around me. The hour is long gone. Time 
to go home; I have so much to do...

55
Jesus and the Virgin Mary
T
HE advent of the 25
th
 of March is at hand. For us Christians, this date 
commemorates a very important religious occasion. Nevertheless, 
for our family it is a little different, as it is also my sister’s birthday; 
that is why I decided to go to Nicosia in search of her customary gift.
I fell into my usual reverie, quite common of late, being stimulated 
by  the  need  to  work  for  my  book.  Everything  now  seems  somehow  
connected one way or another to deep precious memories that on the 
slightest provocation have reason to surface. The nature of my errand 
being such, naturally brings to mind a discussion I had with my father 
in relation to the Virgin Mary. It was the 25
th
 of March once again, the 
day  Christian  Orthodoxy  celebrates  the  Annunciation  of  the  Virgin  
Mary.
“This day is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, why is this?” I asked.
Father  looked  at  me.  “Hmm,”  he  said,  “are  we  talking  about  the  
Virgin Mary and what She represents to us Christian Orthodox; what 
is She to the Catholics and what the Virgin Mary stands for in general 
for all Christians?” 
“Yes,” almost to myself, “who is really the Virgin Mother?” 
“For  us  the  Virgin  Mary,  just  as  the  Christ  Logos,  is  not  only  a  
historical person,” he begins, “I mean, Jesus Christ is not just a person 
who walked barefoot through the streets of Jerusalem, preaching to his 
disciples on the Mount of Olives about Love. He is the Pan-Universal 
Logos! ‘Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I AM,’ He 
declared (John 8:58), referring to a certain other ‘Self ’ in His material 
body. Thus, He insinuated that He IS (in the Infinite-Eternal Present) 
before mountains and Earth existed. And what about the Virgin Mary, 
the Chaste, the Holy Mother? The Virgin whom the Church believes 
gave birth to Jesus and retained her virginity? Is this possible, one may 
ask. But of course it is!
The body of Christ was conceived through Immaculate Conception, 
just as the Virgin Mary was. This means He did not possess a material 
body as we do, but an etheric body, thus facilitating His passage into 
the  world  and  leaving  the  Holy  Mother’s  virginity  intact!  Now,  you  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
56
may  ask,”  Father  said  with  his  characteristic  shake  of  hand,  “Why  
the necessity? And would it be wrong if He had entered the world in 
the  usual  way,  like  everyone  else?  Nothing  wrong  at  all,  but  it  was  
a  matter  of  order,  one  can  say.  I  will  give  you  an  example  to  clarify  
my  point.  Suppose  a  big  concert  is  being  held  with  a  lot  of  people  
coming to attend. Amongst those, there is one who enters the concert 
hall  with  a  clatter,  pushing  his  chair  and  disturbing  all  about  him.  
Why is this? Because he has no proper understanding of what is going 
on.  Now  someone  else,  a  music  lover,  one  who  is  fully  aware  of  his  
whereabouts and knows why he is there, enters on the tips of his toes 
and silently takes his seat, causing no disturbance whatsoever. What 
is the difference between the first and the second man?
Christ came into this world. We also came into the world. He saw 
the Universes, the Gross Material World and the material environment. 
All,  as  a  Unity  was  and  always  is  His  Father’s  Temple.  He  made  no  
noise. He knew. These were all His works, His Father’s works, silent, 
harmonious,  beautiful  and  fine!  Isn’t  Creation  for  us  like  this?  Has  
anyone ever heard Nature germinating? The sprouting of seeds? The 
buds growing on the trees, turning into sweet smelling blossoms and 
then to fruit? Creation makes no noise... nor does the Creator!
The  incarnate  Jesus  Christ  was  born  of  the  Virgin  Mary  as  the  
most  complete  expression  of  the  Pan-Universal  Logos.  The  Virgin  
Mary?...” as if to himself, “Perhaps the most perfect Archangel in the 
Archangelic Orders that are called Authorities. Our Church calls Her 
‘The All-pervading of the Seven Heavens.’ In what respect? In Space? 
As a State? She is the Purest, born on Earth of Joachim and Anna also 
through  Immaculate  Conception.  She  was  a  woman  like  any  other  
woman as a gross material body and Self-aware personality. However, 
how was She inside, do you know?” he asked me. 
“How?” I asked in awe. 
“She  was,  She  is  and  will  ever  be  the  Pan-Universal  Authority,  
‘The All-pervading of the Seven Heavens!’ The one who could expand 
throughout  the  Universes  in  the  Heavens  as  Self-awareness.  Do  you  
know  what  Self-awareness  is?  What  do  you  understand  from  this  
word?” He looked at me smiling at the way I looked at him; wide-eyed 
and  open  mouthed,  eager  to  absorb  everything  from  his  words  and  
live through his experience.
“Consciousness,”  he  said,  putting  an  end  to  my  impatience,  “is  

57
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
the characteristic of Life. We will divide it into subconsciousness and 
self-consciousness,  the  so-called  conscious  state,  plus  another  state  
that gives us a centre of existence with a form of self-awareness. This 
is the principle characteristic of humans. 
Thus,    consciousness,    subconsciousness    and    even    Super-
consciousness  are  all  the  same.  All  the  Archangelic  Orders  within  
the  Holy  Spirit  can  therefore  expand  into  the  Universes  throughout  
Creation in Total wisdom. ‘On the one hand, we have the Archangelic 
System and on the other the Human Race,’ as our Church so rightly 
claims.
What exactly characterises mankind is the condition of life we name 
self-awareness or self-consciousness. Now, what is self-awareness and 
how can we distinguish it from plain consciousness? There is no state 
of  self-awareness  that  does  not  include  all  levels  of  consciousness;  
the subconscious, the conscious and the Super-conscious, all being its 
characteristics. Conversely, self-consciousness relates to our inherent 
ability or rather Nature to be conscious of ourselves and not only of 
the various phenomena of Life.
Nevertheless,   there   are   Archangelic   Orders,   which   possess   
Total  Wisdom,  Total  Power  and  Total  Goodness  that  are  expressed  
as    subconsciousness,    consciousness    and    Super-consciousness    
without  necessarily  manifesting  Self-awareness.  Only  Man  who  is  
a Self-aware Soul eternal Entity, expresses Self-consciousness in the 
Kingdoms of Life. The fact alone, that Man is Self-conscious, gives us 
adequate proof that he is an eternal Entity; not a mortal creature, but 
an immortal Self-aware Soul BE-ing.
There are no words suitably able to express these States. In order 
to become acquainted with them you must experience them yourself 
through  exosomatosis,  not  from  the  material  body,  but  from  the  
psychical  and  noetical  one.  These  three  forms  of  exosomatosis  are  
necessary,  in  order  to  enter  into  this  Reality.  Believe  me,  there  is  
nothing in the Cosmos that promises greater joy than this! To ‘Know 
thy Self’; to know yourself as a Self-aware Entity in the Universes.”
He embraced me in infinite tenderness saying, “I am with you now 
and for always, in whatever you may need! I sense though that you are 
tired, so we will continue this afternoon if you wish.” Before I could 
answer,  my  mother  called,  “Of  course  she  does,  of  course  she  does,  
now to lunch!” During the meal I kept thinking, I should put off our 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
58
talk for much later so I can have a chance to put everything Father had 
said into some order in my mind.
However, I was not one for leaving things half done. Therefore, in 
the afternoon after my homework, I found Father reading in his study. 
I knocked timidly on the door, “May I come in Father, am I disturbing 
you?” He looked up with a smile and signaled his permission. Father’s 
study always provided me with a feeling of infinite security and peace 
when he was in it. I sat down. “So?” he said, his eyes abundantly exuding 
so much tenderness and affection, “And what is Self-awareness?” 
“Hmm...,   feeling   self-conscious.   I   am   Yiota,   a   self-aware   
personality,  but  I  am  also  a  Permanent  Personality,  a  self-aware  
present-day  personality  just  as  a  Self-aware  Soul.”  “Nevertheless,”  
I  added,  “I  am  a  self-aware  present-day  personality.  Is  there  any  
difference between the one personality, the other one and the other?”
“Yes,”  he  said  smiling,  “an  enormous  difference!  I  can  see  ‘light’  
in  a  candle,  an  electric  lamp  and  the  Sun;  all  three  derive  from  the  
Element of Fire. But just how much fire is there in a lit candle, a lamp, 
or the Sun? Which of these is the self-aware present-day personality 
of Yiota? Apart from wandering about in self-awareness, saying that 
‘I am Yiota,’ and knowing about this self from the sum total of your 
desire-elementals? These elementals pertain to your aims, actions and 
thoughts, which are all subject to constant change. Thus, the so-called 
self-aware personality is in constant change, like a receiving centre of 
impressions! 
It is ‘The perishable (corruptible) that will become the Imperishable, 
and the mortal that will dress Immortality’ (First Epistle of Paul to the 
Corinthians 15:53).
 The eternal part is like a centre receiving impressions; but what 
about  the  perimeter  and  the  surface?  It  constantly  changes.  So,  you  
see, Self-awareness in Man is in different stages of development. Self-
awareness is to be found in cavemen and all types of people around us; 
the crafty, the good and the bad as we call them, in the thief or saint... 
The term Self-awareness becomes very limited when associated with 
a name.
Gradually, we shall begin to study our own self-aware personality 
and that of everyone else’s, and come to see it as being the sum total of 
all previous stages of self-awareness and experiences. Self-awareness 

59
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
includes  an  even  greater  depth,  that  we  call  the  subconscious.  This  
is  where  a  lot  of  study  and  progressively  executed  psycho-noetical  
exercises are needed, in order for us to draw the right conclusions. We 
will realise that now we are entering another kind of Self-awareness, 
much wider and much greater! 
As  we  progress  deeper  within,  we  shall  arrive  at  the  so-called  
‘Super   Self-conscious   awareness.’   Here,   in   Super   Self-conscious   
awareness lies our Sainthood!
‘Glory to the Glorified
Glory to the crowned with the Everlasting Crown
Glory to those who act in Thy name!’
Note these phrases! What does ‘Glory to the Glorified’ mean? And 
‘Glory to the crowned?’ What is the meaning of Glory? Let us have no 
illusions.  Does  it  not  refer  to  the  one  who  has  risen  from  a  state  of  
self-awareness, a state with a name, to a state of the so-called ‘Super 
Self-awareness?’
Certainly, God has Glorified this person, through his own efforts 
of  course,  through  his  righteousness  and  purification.  Certainly  this  
is Glory, but not one of the Saints ever purposely intended this Glory! 
‘Glory  to  the  Crowned,’  does  this  mean  a  saint  has  been  crowned?  
What is this ‘Everlasting Crown,’ the Church speaks of? What is it? It 
is none other than the holy disc around the head and the holy sphere, 
which gives one the ability to achieve exosomatosis and expand into 
Cosmic  Consciousness!  This  is  the  Crown!  Without  this  ability,  we  
cannot attain the state we call Sainthood today. The spiritual essence 
of  this  state  is  Total  Love!  It  is  the  expansion  within  and  about  the  
planet!
On the planet we inhabit, we find these states of Consciousness and 
Self-awareness in which we move about and live in. Consequently, at 
this  very  moment  of  speaking,  we  move  about  in  the  Pan-Universal  
Self-awareness  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness’  LOVE,  from  which  we  
gain our strength and energy seeing we are part of it. At the same time 
contained within this state, as well as within us, is an infinity of higher 
frequencies belonging to all the saints; the highest of which being that 
of the Virgin Mary, ‘The All-pervading of the Seven Heavens!’ More 
correctly, they are the frequencies of the Mother of The One and All. 
You  will  always  feel  Her  love!  Even  if  the  greatest  sinner  on  Earth  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
60
should request Her help, She will speed to his aid because we are all 
contained  within  this  immense  Super-conscious  Self-awareness  we  
call ‘The Virgin.’ She is in us and we are in Her!”
Dead  silence  prevailed  in  the  room.  I  can  still  hear  my  father’s  
voice as I tried to absorb the meanings of what I had heard. I broke 
the silence with a question, “How is it that a statue or an icon of the 
Virgin Mary can perform miracles? Is it real or an illusion?”
“It  is  not  an  illusion;  It  is  a  reality!  Each  thought  exerts  power,  
contains energy; and mass thoughts are very powerful and can turn a 
statue or an icon into a strong talisman! Take the statue of the Virgin 
in Lourdes for example, or the icon on the island of Tinos in Greece, 
the Monastery of the Virgin in Kykkos in Cyprus and so many others. 
I know, you will ask me, ‘How is it that some icons perform miracles 
and others not?’
Be aware that any statue or icon of the Virgin Mary can help us 
contact  the  Self-awareness  of  the  Virgin  and  create  a  miracle,  given  
that you do get in touch with Her. In other words, obtain Her blessing. 
The icons mentioned before, are saturated with so much energy and 
power  that  it  is  easier  for  a  devotee  to  go  to  Her  in  deep  emotion  
on  the  actual  day  of  Her  Celebration;  attunement  then  is  easier  and  
better. Thus, we have the phenomenon we call a miracle! It is enough 
to  attune  oneself  in  order  to  consciously  obtain  Her  help.  This  does  
not only apply to the Virgin, but to all the saints as well. 
Regarding the materialisation of the Virgin Mary, many claim to 
have seen Her or one of the Saints when in dire need. They may even 
see Her materialised in the image of the woman she once was when 
alive  in  a  human  body.  Is  the  Virgin  Mary,  the  one  on  this  planet,  
limited to this one image in the material or etheric form? And is She 
at this moment seen only by me or is She simultaneously appearing 
before  someone  else  too?  Can  She  create  thousands  in  Her  image,  if  
She so wishes, at the same time? Yes, She may create thousands in Her 
image, but She is always the one and the same, the Super-conscious 
awareness of the Virgin Mary!”
Father looked at me, deep in thought, as if wondering whether he 
should tell me something on his mind or not. At the end he decided. 
“I have personally seen the Virgin Mary materialise three times! 
However, I cannot say I was the only one favoured. I know that many, 

61
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
very  many  people  have  seen  Her.  Do  you  remember  when  you  were  
small; I had been arrested by the English at the suburb of Omorphita, 
where  they  tortured  me  for  hours  and  hours  on  end.  Half-naked,  I  
was  thrown  on  a  stone  bench.  I  had  turned  blue  with  cold  and  bad  
circulation.  As  day  began  to  dawn,  dead  with  pain,  I  began  calling  
upon the Virgin. ‘Help me, Holy Virgin Mary,’ I cried, ‘Help me!’ No 
sooner had I said this, than I felt a hand under my cheek, gently lifting 
my head. In this dark, empty, locked cell there was no one who could 
have lifted my head. It means She had materialised Her hand! I turned 
my head and there She was! I saw the Virgin Mary! She stooped and 
kissed me here on the forehead and said, ‘Rest in peace, no one loves 
you as I do, not even your own mother! Peace be with you. In a quarter 
of an hour at the most you will be in your own bed quiet and safe,’ and 
She began to dematerialise. I fell upon Her hand and started kissing 
it wildly feeling Her very flesh and bones! I kissed it till it gradually 
disappeared leaving my lips on the stone bench. 
What She had said to me would have appeared absurd to someone 
else  listening  because  I  was  there  waiting  for  my  torturers  to  begin  
again, at any minute. In all right reason, what I had heard from Her 
lips  was  unthought-of.  Home  in  fifteen  minutes!  Nevertheless,  five  
minutes later there was a turmoil outside my cell. I heard noise and 
shouting,  ‘What  is  going  on  here!’  Someone  was  shouting,  ‘There’s  
some  mistake  here!’  Of  course  there  was  no  mistake;  my  arrest  and  
torture had been done deliberately, but still... Then, someone I knew 
who  was  with  the  British,  came  in  and  threw  a  blanket  around  me,  
wrapped me up and then I was taken home half conscious! In all truth, 
I was taken home in a quarter of an hour!
Was all this conjured up by my tortured mind? Can I say the All-
Merciful Mother had graced me only? Dear God, no! Who am I that this 
should be! I tell you my child She may be found at anyone’s bedside, 
no  matter  who  he  is;  a  sinner,  anyone,  no  matter  whom!  When  in  
pain, Our Mother, the Queen of the Heavens is right beside us at that 
very moment, inside us as we are present in Her! And this is a reality!”
He seemed deeply moved by the memory. A few moments passed 
by  in  silence,  then  he  said,  “Let  us  stop  here  now,  we  can  continue  
another day...” I respected his wish and silently left the room to him 
and his thoughts.

The Virgin Mary of Jerusalem. Legend has it that this icon was not made by 
human hand, but by the Virgin Mary Herself. It miraculously appeared to a 
certain nun in Jerusalem after a vision, in 1870.

63
Signs of the Virgin Mary
F
ATHER always prompted me to be observant and he taught me not 
to believe in coincidences, but in the Divine Plan and Providence. 
So,  inevitably  I  came  to  the  conclusion,  that  my  life  was  indelibly  
stamped with the presence of the Virgin Mary.
1. I  was  born  on  the  21
st
  of  November,  the  day  She  entered  the  
Temple.
2. I  was  named  after  Her  on  the  merit  of  my  birthday  and  also  
after my grandfather Panayiotis. Panayia-Παναγία in Greek is 
the  Immaculate  Lady,  hence  the  name  Panayiota  denotes  the  
one who is devoted to the Virgin Mary.
3. My   husband’s   surname,   and   hence   mine,   is   Theotokis,   
meaning the one who is dedicated to Theotokos-Θεοτόκος in 
Greek, which means the Mother of God.
4. My younger sister Irene was born on the 25
th
 of March, the day 
of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary.
The Virgin Mary, the Divine Mother was, is and will always guide our 
family and me.

64
Etheric Vitality
I 
would often observe Father work with the sick and suffering, with 
people ailing or troubled in soul. I wondered, admired and watched. 
Father, being able to read my mind, noticed my curiosity, but would 
let  things  take  their  course,  never  forcing  the  moment  I  should  be  
taught something new. 
“What  is  he  doing,”  I  kept  wondering  to  myself,  “What  does  he  
do?  How  does  he  work?  From  where  is  he  getting  help?  Obviously  
from God, but what part is of the Holy Spirit, and what part comes 
from the Christ Logos? How does he cooperate with Them and know 
from the beginning what results will derive from this work? So many 
people visit him, expecting so many things from him! How is it they 
always leave looking so much better and cheerful?” 
One day when all was quiet and everyone had left, he spoke to me. 
“I know you want to find out how I work, I mean what it is that I do 
exactly. For a start I will tell you very simply.” I smiled thinking that 
for my father, all was so simple. 
He  spoke  to  me  of  the  four  kinds  of  Etheric  Vitality  or  as  he  
explained, “The ‘substance’ which becomes etheric energy.” 
He  said,  “It  is  Mind  vibrating  at  its  lowest  frequency  that  gives  
us  the  body’s  etheric  double.  In  other  words,  the  material  etheric  
double is Mind in vibration at the frequency, which gives us etheric 
substance as matter. This ‘substance’ is transformed into the material 
body.  If  you  remember,  I  have  told  you  that  no  atom  or  cell  in  the  
gross  material  body  can  exist  without  its  etheric  counterpart.  This  
applies  equally  to  both  the  psychical  and  noetical  bodies;  they  also  
have their etheric counterparts. These bodies exist at varying scales of 
frequencies, but for the time being, it is the etheric double of the gross 
material body that concerns us.”
“I  have  told  you,”  he  added,  looking  at  my  intent  expression,  
“that it is directly under the conscious supervision of the Holy Spirit 
because  the  material  body  is  purely  Holy-Spiritual,  possessing  its  
own consciousness and its own sensitivity, but nothing more because 
the material body is only the means through which we express ourself 
as a present-day personality self-awareness.

65
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
On  our  etheric  doubles,  there  are  different  centres.  These  holy  
centres are directly under the supervision of the Holy Spirit, as is for 
example,  the  solar  plexus.  Then,  we  have  the  centre  in  the  area  of  
the heart and the twin centres inside the head. These are positioned 
between  the  two  lobes  of  our  material  brain  and  the  cerebellum.  I  
will explain why I call it ‘twin.’ This twin centre gives us clearly two 
different centres in substance and function; in other words, the holy 
discs. The one disc opens out from the root of the nose between the 
two material eyes. In the more advanced individuals we can see this 
covering the whole of their face! The other one is situated above the 
head.  I  call  them  twin  centres  because  both  centres  are  one  and  the  
same inside the head. This twin centre inside the head of our etheric 
double,  when  once  awakened,  activates  the  full-harmonious  motion  
of the holy Lotus. These discs, when in motion, resemble the petals of 
the beautiful radiation of a lotus flower. When this happens, Man has 
then gained his psycho-noetical powers.
When  the  third  eye,  the  Lotus  disc  before  our  eyes  at  the  base  
of the nose is activated, then Man can see at long distances without 
having to be there. He uses this like a mysterious telescope, which he 
can direct as he wishes and everywhere he wishes; to the ocean bottom 
or the planet’s surface, even to penetrate solids! At first, it gives us the 
phenomenon  of  involuntary  telepathy  and  psychic  vision.  Complete  
control, though, allows us full psychic vision through our present-day 
personality anywhere on this planet, permeating both time and space! 
No other comments on this centre, for the time being.
Regarding the Lotus disc above our head, this pertains to the great 
gateway  leading  us  to  the  Super-conscious  expression  of  our  Self,  
both as consciousness and Self-awareness. Man is then set free from 
the bonds of flesh, nerves and bones.
Then, we have the centre of the heart and the centre of the solar 
plexus. From their separate functions we shall see the kind of Etheric 
Vitality  these  centres  use.  The  centre  of  the  solar  plexus,  with  the  
disc that overlies the three other centres, forms a downward pointing 
triangle ending at the genital organs; one centre being on the liver, the 
other on the spleen and the third being in the area of the genital organs, 
thus completing the formation of the triangle. In this triangle the holy 
disc rests in motion, and this triangle, symbolic but all powerful, is

included within the holy sphere of sky-blue light. Other colours may 
also be seen, but this sky-blue light is the predominant colour.
This  centre  is  in  some  mysterious  way  connected  to  the  etheric  
energy  of  every  cell  and  atom  in  the  gross  material  body.  Can  you  
imagine  this?  A  centre  being  the  solar  plexus,  with  hundreds  and  
thousands of centres in the material body. I am referring to the material 
body and the etheric double of every one of these cells and atoms, as 
being supplied by each centre of every one of these cells and atoms, and 
from each organ inside the body. Thus, creative ether has a multiple 
activity,  and  is  always  under  the  supervision  of  the  Holy  Spirit.
The first centre in which creative ether works, is the centre of the 
genital organs of men and women; the ‘headquarters of Life’: Life the 
sovereign ruler, the dominator, the ‘Grantor of Life,’ the Holy Spirit! 
What is the kind of ether being used, and what is the perfected work 
taking  place  inside  the  spermatozoon  or  ovary?  Certainly  the  most  
marvelous work occurs within each cell, atom and organ! Where there 
is a purpose for the function and economy of the material body, there 
will be extra work for its various parts.
Just  imagine  new  life  being  created  in  the  material  body!  The  
spermatozoon  serving  as  the  means  of  creation  of  a  new  separate  
organism. Did you know that each spermatozoon contains the whole 
Total  Wisdom,  Total  Power  and  Total  Goodness  of  the  Holy  Spirit?  
What has ever existed, exists and will ever exist, is contained therein. 
The  whole  history  of  all  Mankind  is  thus  recorded  in  every  detail  
from  the  moment  of  the  passing  of  our  Higher  Holy-Monadic  Self  
through  the  Idea  of  Man,  to  the  descent  of  the  Self-aware  Soul-Self  
towards its incarnation as an Entity, and finally to the projection of the 
present-day personality self-aware Self, in order to be incarnated and 
materialised on planet Earth!”
Do not believe the different theories that maintain that Man has 
descended from the apes. It is the greatest blasphemy against the Total 
Wisdom of the Absolute BE-ingness! Whosoever is able to psychically 
penetrate and read the spermatozoon by attunement, will witness the 
origin of Man from the moment of his descent and entrance through 
the Idea of Man, and all the experiences he has gained on this planet! 
You may well ask if this is related to his previous incarnations. No, 
it  is  not.  Man’s  individual  experience  through  each  incarnation  is  
recorded in the Cosmic Memory, and not in the total experience of the 

67
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
history of Mankind.
However, if we study our self-aware personality and penetrate the 
Subconscious  Mind  of  a  single  atom  in  the  material  body,  or  in  the  
whole  of  the  material  body,  or  in  the  etheric  double  of  the  material  
body and enter the present-day personality self-aware Self, we shall 
certainly enter the Self-aware Permanent Personality. There we shall 
see all our past incarnations in time and place.
What  I  have  previously  mentioned  though,  is  different.  When  
we  penetrate  the  Pan-Universal  Cosmic  Consciousness,  especially  
in  a  spermatozoon,  we  will  see  the  complete  history  of  mankind  
in  the  Total  Wisdom  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  How  is  this  possible?  The  
Holy  Spirit  is  found  right  in  the  centre  of  the  creative  ether  of  the  
spermatozoon. Naturally the Holy Spirit has need of kinetic ether, a 
form of sensate ether unknown to Man and to his consciousness, but 
in the Holy-Spiritual Consciousness it is different to what we know. 
Therefore, we have the kinetic ether to give us those vibrations, which 
we call creative ether. Through the activity of kinetic ether and its own 
Nature  as  Pan-Universal  Consciousness,  the  Holy  Spirit  transforms  
Etheric Vitality into creative ether to build, restore and maintain the 
phenomenon of Life.
We have approximately the same work going on by creative ether 
in the consciousness of the atom and the cell. Blood cells and atoms 
are  all  the  same,  however  there  are  different  amounts  supplied  to  
different organs. The creative ether performs differently in the bones, 
differently  in  the  flesh  and  blood  and  again  works  differently  in  the  
various other organs.”
“What happens with the imprinting ether Father?” 
“Imprinting ether is somewhere else, as Total Wisdom in the Idea 
of Man regarding the material body of Man’s present-day self-aware 
personality,  the  Permanent  Self-aware  Personality  and  the  psychical  
and noetical bodies.” 
“So then, does imprinting ether, built by the Holy Spirit, reside in 
the Idea of Man?” 
“Yes, ‘I come forth from the Father, and am come into the world: 
again, I leave the world, and go to the Father’ (John 16:28), meaning 
the  eternal  contemplation  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness.  Now,  the  
creation of the personality of Man, the present-day personality self-

awareness,  which  is  the  extension  of  the  entity  through  the  Idea  of  
Man  and  the  descent  of  the  Permanent  Personality  Self-aware  Soul,  
is the work of the Christ Logos. This is exactly where we differentiate 
the work performed in the material body by the Holy Spirit on the one 
hand and the Christ Logos on the other. There is perfect cooperation 
between  them,  but  however,  the  work  differs.  Our  material  body  is  
not our Self. It is built by the Holy Spirit, and as present self-aware 
personalities we ‘inhabit’ the material body by the grace of God, until 
we eventually come to feel our Oneness with Christ; ‘The true Light, 
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world’ (John 1:9).
We have now made a distinction between the work performed by 
the outpouring of the Absolute BE-ingness as the Christ Logos and as 
the Holy Spirit. Did you understand?”
“Yes,” I replied, “I have understood, but I must think it over and 
revise it all to be certain. I will ask you if I have any more questions.”

Faith and Will
O
NE Sunday, as Father and I were returning home from church, I 
thought  about  the  devout  people  I  had  seen  during  the  service.  
There were young people, elderly men and women, some kneeling in 
prayer; and as I walked along I wondered whether these people were 
really aware of the significance of what they were doing or if they were 
just going through the motions from mere force of habit. I decided that 
I would ask Father on the subject and get my answers.
On arriving home, Father sat in his usual armchair and waited for 
Mother to bring his coffee. I approached him rather hesitantly, “Can I 
ask you something, Father?”
Father smiled. He raised his arm in his characteristic manner, and 
beckoned  to  me  with  his  finger,  “Come,”  he  said.  I  sat  beside  him.  
“What is it dear?”
“Daddy, tell me what faith really is...”
“That’s a good question! What is faith? Or better still, what is faith 
and  will?  Because  one  cannot  have  faith  without  will.  To  start  with,  
will is the foundation block. One must have the will to know the Truth. 
How  can  we  gain  faith  with  no  will?  Our  indispensable  foundation  
stone is will-desire, call it that, in order to know the Truth and work 
on it. This is necessary because faith is the product of knowledge and 
experience. We cannot believe in something if first we do not know it 
to be true.
Let  us  say,  for  example,  that  a  person  tells  you  something  and  
asks you to believe him. If you accept his word as Truth without first 
proving  its  validity  for  yourself,  then  you  are  foolish.  On  the  other  
hand, if you do accept this as the Truth then this belief is blind, it is 
false, with no grounds of support and will soon crumble. Or, again, 
if  someone  else  with  the  gift  of  persuasion,  comes  to  you  and  tells  
you  something  with  such  conviction  that  you  believe  him;  this  can  
only  be  temporary,  as  sooner  or  later  you  are  bound  to  discover  its  
falsity.  Where  is  the  strength  of  faith  in  this?  It  will  automatically  
fall apart. Therefore, rational thinking is an absolute requirement for 
faith, which ‘Can move mountains,’ as Christ said.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
70
Now, rational thinking is something which is generally regarded 
as  being  logical.  Many  things  that  are  very  true  today  would  not  be  
thought  so  in  the  past.  They  would  be  called  irrational.  Neither  can  
what was true then, be accepted as being true today. So, if eighty years 
ago, with the standard of rational thinking of the time, I had said to 
someone that there would be a box with a glass front and buttons to 
press,  with  a  device  to  plug  into  electricity,  he  probably  would  not  
believe  it;  he  would  not  even  know  what  electricity  was.  Then,  how  
could you expect him to believe in this box, which in some mysterious 
way,  when  the  button  was  pressed,  could  transmit  pictures  from  all  
over  the  world?  Assume  that  today,  if  we  were  to  speak  to  someone  
in  the  manner  of  rationality  of  eighty  years  ago,  do  you  think  that  
it  could  be  accepted  as  the  Truth?  I  do  not  think  so.  Therefore,  you  
realise that our so-called ‘rational thinking’ goes hand in hand with 
the experience and knowledge gained over a period of time.
That  is  why  you  should  never  insist  you  know  something  
absolutely.  We  know  about  something,  and  that  something  must  be  
experienced  before  we  can  believe  in  it.  During  the  time  of  Christ,  
people  witnessed  Him  perform  very  many  miracles,  but  do  the  
Christians of today accept them as true? Quite a few do not, and they 
consider those that do as having been deceived or as liars! Be aware 
then that rationalism is absolutely necessary before we can build the 
edifice  called  faith.  There  is  not  enough  of  it  today,  so  never  try  to  
convince someone that his rationality is not up to the standard needed 
to understand you. You will not achieve anything.
So dear, you see now that rational thinking is our first prerequisite 
for developing our faith; desire and will follow. Without experience 
how else can we strengthen this alleged faith? Faith will then become 
the  power  of  our  self-aware  personality,  which  in  turn,  will  be  able  
to express this strength. As for our Permanent Personality Self-aware 
Soul, there is no question of faith! We have to, therefore, work with 
our self-aware present-day personality and help it gain experience, so 
that when it is finally ready and pure enough, it will become one with 
our Permanent Personality Self-aware Soul.”
“Faith,”  he  further  elaborated,  “for  us,  means  certainty  achieved  
through   experience,   which   is   accompanied   by   firm   rationalism   
and  the  strength  found  in  Will.  We  ought  to  utilize  it,  in  order  to  
increase  our  faith  even  further.  For  me,  power  of  Will  and  strength  

71
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
of  Faith,  are  synonymous.  As  you  progress,  you  will  find  it  to  be  
the  same  for  you  too.  It  is  precisely  this  faith  or  faith-certainty,  
obtained   through   Will,   that   should   be   used   for   the   common   
good  of  your  fellow  men.  What  we  commonly  call  ‘faith’  does  
not  come  of  itself,  but  it  is  won;  it  is  not  given,  but  it  is  gained!  
Take  note  of  this,”  he  concluded  smiling.  “Are  you  happy  now?”  
“For the moment, yes,” I said laughingly and rushed out to play.
ATON as the Noetic Sun bestowing upon the Pharaoh Ankh-en-Aton Its rays of 
LIFE-ANKH – A relief from the sacred city of Ankh-en-Aten, currently known as 
Am-aRa-na or Amarna. In the 14
th
 century B.C. during the seventeen-year reign 
of  the  Great  Pharaoh-Hierophant  Ankh-en-Aton  (Akenaton),  both  the  Pharaoh  
and his nephew Highest-Priest Khor-Aton denounced the polytheistic Egyptian 
Pantheon  and  established  the  worship  of  the  One  God-ATON.  Additionally,  
they  made  important  changes  to  the  Symbol  of  Life  that  was  in  use  at  the  
time by removing all added names and signs of the multitude of gods, planets 
and  elemental  mundane  forces.  Hence  the  Symbol  of  Life,  purified  by  human  
intervention, became once again a tool of true spiritual upliftment and attunement 
with the Absolute BE-ingness. It is crucial to realise that Man on Earth, under the 
influence of the egoism of his present-day personality, has the tendency to abuse 
benevolent  forces-powers,  concepts  or  symbols.  Eventually,  Man  will  come  
to  his  senses,  recognise  this  sacrilege  and  repent.  This  is  the  course  of  things.

72
Judas Iscariot
I 
often  observed  how  Father  treated  his  pupils  and  friends,  the  way  
in  which  he  spoke  and  taught  them,  and  how  he  loved  every  one  
of  them.  At  the  same  time,  I  could  also  see  how  often  people  took  
advantage of his goodness. Countless visitors came to our house, and 
I could see that a large number of them arrived with the sole intention 
of  personal  gain.  It  pained  me  to  see  the  way  Father’s  kindness  was  
being abused. I suppose you must wonder whether he was aware of 
it.  Of  course  he  was,  and  whenever  I  brought  this  issue  up,  saying,  
“I know you understand and see everything, so why don’t you react? 
Why do you let them betray you like this?” 
He  always  smiled.  “It  is  not  me  they  betray,  if  you  can  call  it  
betrayal,  but  themselves.  For  me,  these  people  have  not  learnt  their  
lesson in this life, so they shall have to come back and repeat it!”
This  subject  would  come  up  many  times  in  our  talks.  On  one  
occasion, since one of his longtime pupils had wronged him, and for 
reasons  of  his  own  had  left  Father,  terrible  thoughts  raced  through  
my  mind  and  impulsively  I  uttered  the  words,  “One  more  traitor!”  
Naturally, this led to my next question, “Why did Judas betray Christ? 
Why did he commit suicide? What reason was there?”
Father  knew  how  I  felt  and  why  I  was  asking  these  questions.  
He  beckoned  me  to  approach  him,  in  his  characteristic  way,  saying,  
“Come and sit beside me.” Naturally, he was absolutely aware I was 
not comparing him to Christ! 
He turned to me and asked, “Who was Judas? Who knows Judas 
and  what  do  we  know  about  him?  Judas,  as  known  to  the  disciples  
of  Christ,  was  a  Judean  aristocrat,  a  rather  ambitious  one  I  would  
say, but a patriot; a Jewish Zealot, call him that. He aspired to deliver 
Judaea of the Roman conquerors. There were several thousands of a 
like mind at the time.
But first, let us examine Judas Iscariot as the time and place self-
aware  personality  he  was  back  then.  He  was  the  one  who  attached  
himself to Christ, whom he admired greatly, hoping to deliver Israel 
from the Roman yoke through Jesus! He had his dreams; the dreams 

73
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
and  aspirations  of  the  present-day  personality  of  Judas  Iscariot,  the  
individual. He was a man of his own thought and vision. He had his 
good points and bad points, faults and merits, his own way of loving 
and  behaving,  all  of  which  were  familiar  to  the  disciples.  This  was  
Judas Iscariot as a present-day personality.
Now,  like  Judas  the  Zealot,  there  were  thousands  more  in  Israel  
as there are even today, still vibrating on the same frequency, I would 
say. Isn’t it obvious? Don’t we see the same vibrations in every country 
all over the world, where we have people trying to change this or that 
political  situation,  and  thus  causing  more  trouble?  In  this  case  they  
are not named Judas, but have other names. These are the people who 
dream  of  setting  their  country,  or  what  they  call  their  country,  free  
from the despot or invader.
Therefore, what we now see, apart from the specific personality of 
Judas Iscariot, is a situation occurring repeatedly on this planet, well 
before the arrival of the Godman! Consequently, we can study and see 
the relationship of one personality to other personalities, and also one 
circumstance  to  other  circumstances.  We  have  certain  personalities  
under  the  influence  of  one  set  of  circumstances  while  others  remain  
totally indifferent, but in turn react to a different set of eventualities. 
Now, we begin to see things from a very different perspective. Given 
the  conditions  at  the  time,  Judas  reacted  in  a  way  that  led  him  to  
behave recklessly into betrayal, as we and many others would say, and 
still believe that he reacted wisely! It makes no difference. Each man 
acts according to his own light.
To  further  clarify,  we  now  have  Judas  in  the  presence  of  the  
disciples  and  of  Christ’s  most  beloved,  claiming  the  Master’s  love  
as  his  own,  embracing  Him  and  kissing  Him  at  every  opportunity  
while discouraging the attempts of the others. Christ would return the 
kiss. The Godman attached much importance to this gesture. Do you 
remember that He said, ‘Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a 
kiss?’  (Luke  22:48).  This  was  the  way  Judas  showed  his  love  for  his  
Master as did His beloved disciple, John the Evangelist or Yiohannan, 
and two or three other disciples of His. The rest showed their affection 
in  other  ways.  To  Peter,  for  example,  this  rough  disciple  of  Christ,  
it  would  seem  ridiculous  to  kiss  his  Master!  However,  the  others,  
being of a gentler nature and disposition, chose to demonstrate their 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
74
love in this way. Judas likewise did, and whenever the other disciples 
approached Christ, he would vehemently push them aside, so he could 
claim the Master’s attention for himself. Obviously Judas loved Christ 
very much!
Being  in  close  proximity  to  Christ,  Judas  was  often  a  witness  
to  His  ample  miracles.  What  was  then  Judas’  intention?  What  was  
his  ambition?  It  was  to  crown  Jesus  king  and  to  stand  beside  Him  
as  His  advisor,  one  could  say.  Being  in  charge  of  the  money,  he  had  
already  ordered  a  golden  crown!  Read  the  Bible.  Who  do  you  think  
had organised ‘Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in 
the name of the Lord’ (John 12:13)? Who was the one that urged the 
crowd  to  give  Christ  that  huge  welcome?  Judas  Iscariot!  His  motive  
was to ‘pave the way’ to the eventual crowning of Jesus Christ!
Once, when Christ was among the Pharisees, someone asked Him 
if He was really the Son of God. Christ replied, ‘Verily, verily, I say unto 
you, Before Abraham was, I AM,’ (John 8:58), and in Aramaic ‘Ehyeh 
Asher Ehyeh - Beni Alaha, Beni Adonai Melekh.’ The three beloved 
disciples were present at this response. Many raised stones to strike 
Him, but before the first stone could touch Him, Christ vanished from 
amongst  them.  Where  did  those  stones  fall?  On  the  empty  ground  
where Christ had been standing! How many such miracles didn’t the 
Pharisees, His prosecutors, witness? Of course they saw them and so 
did Judas. He was there when the aggressors had tried to stone Christ 
for blasphemy, as they said, and they saw Christ dematerialise before 
their eyes. 
It was then that Judas decided upon his plan. It was as if to say, 
‘You think You can refuse me, but I will show You. I will crown You 
king!’ So, he had the crown made, and when all was ready according 
to  his  plan  he  gathered  the  disciples  and  the  people  together.  The  
moment  the  crown  was  raised  above  Christ’s  head,  He  disappeared  
once  again,  and  Judas  was  left  there  standing  petrified  holding  the  
crown  in  his  hands.  Christ  had  dematerialised  for  the  second  time.  
This  was  the  infuriated  Judas  who  swore,  ‘When  I  force  You,  then  
You will accept! When You are abused and driven out...!’ It was as if 
he wanted to blackmail Christ into accepting: ‘When they attack You, 
what will You do then? You will be obliged to raise Your hand, and 
show them Your Might and Glory! You will be weary of the carrying 
on of these villains, and You will be compelled to become King!’

WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
Therefore,  you  realise  that  it  was  not  Judas’  intention  to  betray  
Christ, but to coerce Him into becoming the leader of the Judeans and 
thus provoke the flight of the Romans out of Palestine. Nevertheless, 
Jesus had clearly stated, ‘My kingdom is not of this world,’ meaning 
‘Judas,  at  least  understand!’  This  is  exactly  what  Judas  did  not  wish  
to do, to comprehend that Christ was not interested in earthly power. 
That’s  why  he  followed  the  course  of  action,  as  written  in  the  New  
Testament.
In the New Testament we are given Christ’s most precious lesson 
to us on His final night. Judas is not a traitor. He is Christ’s beloved 
thoughtless one! ‘I bathe his feet and kiss them...’ Yes, Christ not only 
bathed His disciples’ feet that last night, but kissed them also. He did 
the  same  to  Judas  before  telling  him,  ‘That  thou  doest,  do  quickly’  
(John 13:27). Christ must have deeply loved Judas. He knew full well 
what he was about to do.
There was another lesson Christ wished to teach his disciples and 
to Nicodemus, who was also present that night; concerning the Great 
Truths related to Spirit. Those who could understand Him were only 
three of His beloved disciples, John, Philip and Jacob; the remainder 
were  to  wait  until  the  moment  of  enlightenment  with  the  descent  
of  the  Holy  Ghost  during  the  Pentecost.  On  many  occasions  Christ  
declared  to  them,  ‘It  is  the  Spirit  that  quickeneth;  the  flesh  profiteth  
nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit, and they 
are Life’ (John 6:63). ‘God is Spirit: and they that worship Him must 
worship Him in Spirit and in Truth’ (John 4:24). ‘Ye are gods; and all 
of you are children of the most High’ (Psalm 82:6). ‘And ye shall be the 
children of the Highest’ (Luke 6:35). ‘I said, Ye are gods’ (John 10:34). 
‘The wind [Spirit] bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound 
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so 
is everyone that is born of the Spirit’ (John 3:8). In other words, the 
Spirit  breathes  where  it  wills,  expressing  the  Self,  our  Soul-Self  as  
Will power and Self-awareness. This is what Christ taught, but they 
were unable to comprehend His teachings.
Christ materialised and dematerialised before them, demonstrating 
different phenomena; finally He had to tell them, ‘It is the Spirit that 
quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing’ (John 6:63). And also ‘Destroy the 
temple, and in three days I will raise it up’ (John 2:19), implying the 
temple of His material body.

He knew exactly what was coming. He was aware that the Pharisees 
would kill His body. He even foretold it in the presence of Judas by 
saying explicitly, ‘Look! See who I am! I am soon to be crucified, but 
I shall rise again in three days!’ But regretfully, Judas was blind. He 
only saw what he chose to see; what best suited his temperament and 
his patriotic mission.
Judas  was  also  a  witness  to  the  miracle  in  the  garden  of  olives  
where he heard Christ tell Peter, ‘Put up again thy sword into its place: 
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest 
thou that I cannot now pray to my Father and he shall presently give 
me more than twelve legions of angels?’ (Matthew 26:52-53). Meaning, 
‘Peter,  you  cannot  defend  Me,  it  must  be  so.’  Therefore,  Judas  upon  
seeing that Christ offered no resistance, realised that He was about to 
be crucified. It was then that he began to doubt Christ the Man. Judas 
was  left  heartbroken  and  devastated  thinking  that  his  Master  had  
lost His powers and was about to be abused and beaten, crucified and 
killed. At the sight of his beloved Master, with the bloodstained crown 
of thorns upon His head, he was then utterly convinced that Christ’s 
powers had forsaken Him and that He would be killed. There would 
be  no  Resurrection!  Judas,  the  man,  was  devastated  and  committed  
suicide! That was his great mistake.
How  many  people  in  desperation  commit  suicide?  It  happens  
every day. Now, we have examined the personality of Judas Iscariot, 
but  how  many  Judas  Iscariots  don’t  we  encounter  everywhere  and  
always,  in  every  period  in  history?  They  are  mere  instruments  of  
circumstance, as we mentioned before.
Nevertheless, circumstances inevitably do exist. However, through 
rational  thinking  and  meditation  we  can  transmute  our  earthly  
experience into a higher state, such that of Mercy or Sacrifice that are 
attributes of Pan-Universal Love expressed on the planet, in our Solar 
System and the Cosmos. So, we have this situation, which I will not 
call betrayal, because it is too hard a word, but I will call it ignorance, 
stupidity,  or  distress.  How  many  people  don’t  we  also  call  traitors  
today?
Therefore, which Judas are we talking about? Are we talking about 
the personality of Judas Iscariot, the one who loved Christ beyond all 
reason, foolishly and selfishly, or the fanatic who loved an imaginary 
country? Which country? Where is it now?

WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
Today  we  know  the  reason  behind  Israel’s  plight  of  war  and  
bloodshed between the Arabs and the Jews. It is due to the thoughts 
and desires of ‘Zealots’ of the past, who by now must have been brought 
to  their  senses  seeing  the  chaos  they  have  created!  You  see,  we  all  
have to deal with the influence of events, which must be dissolved and 
de-energised,  as  well  as  with  the  self-aware  personalities  of  people  
who are sensitive to one or the other set of circumstances.
Once, when one of the beloved disciples spoke against Judas, Christ 
answered, ‘Careful when you mention the word traitor for any Judas 
in particular, for each time it is Me that you crucify!’ Consequently, 
take care before pronouncing the word ‘traitor’ against any one of your 
brothers, no matter what the reason, because that very instant you are 
nailing Christ to the cross once more! Those were Christ’s very words.”

78
Certain Archangelic Orders
O
NE  time,  after  Father  had  finished  his  lesson,  I  decided  to  ask  
him  some  questions.  There  were  one  or  two  points  I  had  not  
understood that he had mentioned to his pupils.
“Father, you said that there are certain Archangels that open up like 
a Six-pointed Star, enclose the Evil Ones (the Demons) and gradually 
transform them from within into angels of light. Are these Archangels 
ordained for this purpose and are they Self-aware?”
“Of  course  they  are,”  Father  said,  “because  if  this  Archangelic  
Order  did  not  possess  Self-awareness,  they  would  have  not  acted  in  
this way. This is the advantage of having Self-awareness.” 
“Oh, so there are Archangelic Orders with Self-awareness then?”
“Yes, of course, but not like ours, because when our Self-awareness 
is such and we say, ‘I am that I am’ and we point to our material body, 
and the ‘I’ is just a name... then...? However, these Archangelic Orders 
possess a kind of Super Self-awareness Holy-Spiritual Consciousness. 
They understand the meaning of ‘I am that I am,’ but without knowing 
what it is. Since they are Self-Sufficient they have no need of anything 
else, but if they wish to meditate on ‘I-ness’ they can easily do so. For 
instance, an Archangel can attune to someone’s frequencies and then 
know what the person knows, for the length of time that He is attuned. 
Then, He ‘detaches’ Himself from the person’s vibrations and returns 
to  Himself,  to  His  Holy-Spiritual  Consciousness,  and  has  no  desire  
for  Self-awareness.  In  other  words,  He  transports  Himself  from  the  
Human Race to His Order. Just as our Church says, ‘The Archangelic 
System (Orders) and the Human Race,’ remember?”
“Father,” I asked, “can a man become an Archangel?”
“Yes, he may enter the Archangelic Super-conscious BE-ingness, 
but  at  that  moment  he  must  sacrifice  his  own  Self-consciousness.  
Doesn’t the same thing happen when one attunes to the frequency of 
an animal or plant, or any situation? He then becomes one with the 
desired object in order to acquire knowledge of it. He knows he is a Holy 
BE-ing of a Great Monad, but at that moment he cannot distinguish 
between becoming a rose, for example, through attunement, or realise 

79
WHISPERS OF THE SOUL
in  this  state  that  he  is  Yiota  or  Maria.  When  he  detaches  himself  
from this frequency and returns to his own, he knows what he is and 
what  he  was  before.  It  is  as  if  he  is  in  a  dreamless  sleep,  a  state  of  
annihilation.
We enter a State of Holy-Spiritual Consciousness, which in reality 
is our own Holy-Spiritual Nature. What happens then? We exit from 
that State and ‘wake up’ as we say, in our material body, in time and 
place and we become once more what we were before; the limited self-
aware state of our present-day personality... However, this requires a 
lot of study for you to fully comprehend. Not through mere thought 
and  theory,  but  through  living  and  experiencing,  through  sincere  
study. Live it and let it become part of you. Live it through experience!”
“Father, let me just ask you one more thing...”
“Yes, dearest.”
“I  want  to  know  if  we  can  interpret  the  frequencies  of  Etheric  
Vitality as Love.”
He  smiled,  “Love  cannot  be  turned  into  Power.  It  remains  Love;  
strength is strength. Etheric vitality is the instrument of Love, which is 
interpreted as strength. Do not confuse them. Love is God and remains 
Love. Etheric Vitality is the Power of Mind, the means!”

The Eagle Flies Alone
G
ROWING up, I noticed something strange. Sometimes we spoke 
to each other in words, and sometimes we talked with our minds. 
I wanted to be sure that it was not my imagination, so I discussed this 
matter  with  him.  Studying  his  teaching,  I  still  hear  his  voice  in  my  
mind: 
“Look very closely at what you are reading.” 
I quickly realised new dimensions in his writings as new wisdom 
opened  up.  I  was  a  little  afraid,  but  I  heard  his  voice  in  my  mind  
whispering again. 
“Fly my Eagle, fly!”
“Father, the eagle flies alone. I do not want to be alone.” 
“Fly, many people will follow! I believe in you. Believe in yourself! 
Do not let your fears become thoughts! Embrace them with love and 
they will disappear.” 
“I am not afraid of anything, Father. I know that my Spirit is free 
and that no one can enslave it. My body can be killed, but my Spirit-
Soul will always fly, always! Father, can I ask you something? In many 
lives I fought for my freedom, but now I am studying. Why? When I 
study, will I see why I was fighting? Even though I lost many times, I 
feel it is not a shame to lose. Shame is only to lose without honour.” 
I  saw  a  smile  on  his  face.  “Father,  they  say  that  a  thought  that  
brings a smile has to be shared!” 
“I read your mind, my love, and I agree with you. The footpath you 
follow is very difficult and it is all yours.” 
“I know Father, I know.”

Travelling with Daskalos 
on the Symbol of Life

How Travelling with Daskalos on the Symbol 
of Life Came About on the 12-12-2012
A 
few  days  prior  to  my  father’s  birthday  on  the  12
th
  of  December,  
I had an eerie feeling that something would happen; I could not 
sense  what.  As  was  customary  this  day,  I  went  to  the  cemetery  and  
took care of his grave, I prayed and waited.
On  the  12
th
  of  December,  I  spent  the  day  with  my  family,  but  
nothing strange took place. I went to bed at night after work. Everything 
seemed  quiet,  tranquil.  Upon  falling  asleep,  at  least  I  thought  I  was  
sleeping,  my  father  appeared!  He  started  talking  to  me  about  the  
Symbol of Life. My first thought was, ‘Father, are you going to start 
telling me the same things again?’ Then, a voice within me said, ‘Put 
your personality-self in order and listen!”
And so, it was that I found myself travelling with my father on the 
Symbol of Life. I encountered things I knew, and other things I had 
never  heard  before.  It  was  strange  because  not  only  did  I  hear  what  
he  was  saying,  but  I  was  living  it  at  the  same  time.  It  was  a  multi-
dimensional experience!
At the beginning, I thought he was addressing only me, using the 
word ‘You’ in the singular. Later, however, I realised he was referring 
to ‘All of you.’ I looked around to see if any other people were present 
besides  me,  but  in  vain.  I  thought  that  maybe  I  was  not  able  to  see  
them, maybe he was talking to students who live on Earth like me or 
to students from other levels, and he did not want us to see each other, 
but  instead  he  wanted  us  to  focus  on  what  he  was  telling  us  and  to  
experience it.
So, I decided to give all my attention to what he was saying, and 
at the same time to experience it. Every day, I kept notes so I would 
not  forget  anything.  I  realised  that  he  would  continue  to  pass  on  
information in this way for a while. As a result, I tried to keep myself 
in balance and to find some rest during the day, in order to be able to 
absorb all the information during the night.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
86
He also gave me a direct message for all of us that I will 
convey to you at the end of the book, so that his words are to 
be better engraved in your mind.
Now,  a  new  thought  struck  me:  When  he  starts  a  sentence  with  
‘All of you,’ he might want me to share all this with you. Who knows? 
For sure there must be a reason why he appears to me so vividly and 
so  regularly.  It  seems  that  it  is  now  time  to  focus  on  certain  aspects  
he  mentioned.  There  are  so  many  Greek  lessons  in  my  files,  but  not  
enough time to filter all this material. Perhaps, he comes to direct my 
attention to certain subjects in this way because he sees my limitations 
on the material plane.
Some  lessons  from  the  files  drop  into  my  hands  ‘by  chance,’  as  
for instance the lesson about the Fallen Ones that I found. Yet, we all 
know that there is no coincidence. In this lesson my father describes 
how the Archangels transform negative existences into positive ones. 
I  realise  that  in  my  daily  life  there  is  very  much  negativity  around,  
and I know we must learn how to transform this negativity into good 
energy,  as  the  Archangels  are  constantly  doing.  If  I  had  not  learnt  
how to do this, I would have become desperate with the behaviour of 
certain  people.  After  so  many  years  of  working  together,  I  still  have  
to face accusations, lies and misunderstandings. It is my way to stay 
calm and to proceed in my work undisturbed. I do not have time to 
spare to enter into discussions on such a level.
I am not expecting all Group Leaders to help me, but at least I wish 
they would not cause me troubles. I am sincerely trying to present as 
much material as I can from the vast treasure my father left behind. 
And I am sure those who want to proceed will value this teaching. I am 
amazed, touched and uplifted that my father is in such close contact 
with me now, and I try to be a clear channel in order to bring down 
what he teaches me.
What I can remember, I want to share with you.

87
The Advent of the Symbol of Life
I 
remember  my  father  back  in  the  mid  eighties  presenting  to  us  a  
totally  novel  concept  regarding  the  Research  after  the  Truth,  the  
Symbol of Life. He judged that it was the appropriate time to reveal 
this sacred teaching to the world. 
On one occasion, during a lesson of the Innermost Circle, Daskalos 
announced:  “The  Great  Master  (Father  Yiohannan)  demanded  that  I  
should transfer a full-size Symbol of Life from the Higher Dimensions 
to this Material World of ours. I must admit that I cannot perceive the 
reason for this command. Anyway, it will do no harm to the uninitiated 
who may be seeing it as an image or a picture. But nevertheless, when 
the  Great  Master  magnetises  it  appropriately,  it  will  radiate  power  
so  that  the  students  coming  here  –  even  those  of  the  outer  circle  of  
psychotherapists – will be inspired by it. Very soon, we shall have in 
hand this painting of the Symbol of Life, provided I find some time to 
construct it.”
Initially, he was involved in painting a huge Symbol of Life in oil, 
on a 2.20 metres long and 1.20 metres wide wooden board on which 
he  affixed  the  canvas.  He  made  no  preparatory  sketches  at  all;  not  
even a preliminary study, as artists usually do. He just downloaded it 
from the Cosmic Archives, which are everywhere and within us, and 
presented it to us. The colours, the centres, the paths and the various 
symbols were so vibrant, as if they were alive. Later on, he revealed 
to me that this painting is a perpetual, living Archangelic Elemental, 
made with the permission, assistance and inspiration of the Logos and 
Yiohannan, the Holy Spirit and the Holy Archangels, our Brethren.
He secretly introduced the teaching of the Symbol of Life to a small 
group  of  Researchers  of  the  Innermost  Circle.  All  prior  information  
and knowledge proved to be ‘hand and glove’ with the new doctrine. 
Under  his  inspired  guidance,  everything  fitted  nicely  and  elegantly  
onto  the  Symbol  of  Life.  Soon,  we  came  to  realise  that  this  Divine  
Symbol  was  a  most  precious  pan-universal  code,  and  that  whoever  
holds its keys would be able to approach all mysteries. Furthermore, 
the  Symbol  would  lead  the  Researcher  after  the  Truth  to  the  great  
science of Attunement and henceforth ‘At-one-ment’ to the Divine. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
88
Attunement is our inherent ability to adjust our vibrations to the 
frequency  of  any  other  existence  or  being  to  the  extent  that  we  can  
observe and study its nature. Attunement is reached prior to ‘At-one-
ment.’ 
‘At-one-ment’ is a Super Self-conscious state in which a BE-ing is 
able to entirely merge Itself in a state of complete unity with any other 
BE-ing  or  existence,  and  with  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  in  Theosis,  
without ever abandoning Its Self-Conscious Ego. 
The teaching of the Godman Joshua Immanuel the Christ can be 
depicted and represented on the Symbol of Life, down to the last detail. 
The apocryphal and highly symbolic book of ‘The Apocalypse’ of St. 
John  the  Evangelist,  our  Master  Father  Yiohannan,  is  miraculously  
embodied on the Symbol. What a revelation! I was fascinated.
Later, my father passionately engaged himself day and night with 
the writing of his book ‘The Symbol of Life - Das Symbol des Lebens.’ 
He attuned his Spirit-Soul-Ego Self to the Highest Planes of the Divine, 
so as to present to this world yet another bright aspect of the multiform 
Diamond  of  Truth.  
“You  are  the  Symbol  of  Life;  everything  is  on  
this Symbol,”
 he used to remind me on every occasion.
He urged me to study the vibrations of the various colours on the 
Symbol, to get to know, or rather remember again, the old Egyptian 
language, and especially the power of the sounds.
The  years  passed  by  and  gradually  he  decided  to  make  this  
knowledge available to the public. He spoke overtly about the Symbol 
of Life, his book was published and sketches of it were given to the 
Researchers  after  the  Truth.  However,  he  only  revealed  all  that  was  
permissible to be revealed; prudency above all.
The initial painting remained, for safe-keeping purposes, locked 
in his house in Strovolos, near the Stoa. At some stage, sixteen years 
after my father’s ascent to the Heavens, a brother from Athens asked 
my  permission  to  take  a  picture  of  the  Symbol.  I  consented,  and  
upon his arrival accompanied by his wife, we entered Father’s house, 
unlocked the old sitting room (previously it was our parents’ bedroom) 
and approached the painting. My father had secured it to the wall, as 
if it was meant to be a standard fixture of the house.
Dust inevitably reigned in the room. Everything was covered by a 
thick layer of fine grey dust. Everything but, the Symbol of Life. What 

89
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
a miracle! Not even a single molecule of dust! It stood there spotless in 
an immaculate condition untouched by matter and time. All elements 
had respected it...
This  Holy  Logoic,  Holy-Spiritual  and  Archangelic  elemental  
within our Self, awaits to be revived by each one of us in our present-
day personality self-aware Self.

the old family house, in 2010. Please notice its dimensions in relation to the 
human stature.

The Symbol of Life – A General Overview
When studying or working on the Symbol of Life, always bear in 
mind that it is placed on the human form as seen from behind, 
as if we were to wear it as a garment. Therefore, the 
Red side 
is always on our 
Right and the Purple side is on our Left.
In this section of the book the reader will observe that there are 
several repetitions pertaining to the study and work on the Symbol 
of Life that interlace with the main subject of each chapter. As 
repetition was one of Daskalos’ favourite teaching tools, it has 
been treated with respect in order to maintain the authenticity of 
the lessons. Repetition variants give us the opportunity to reflect 
on a certain concept either from a different angle or under the 
perspective of the specific context of each lesson.
All chapters of this section are self-contained and therefore they 
may be studied independently. 
The  direction  of  the  various  Paths  connecting  the  Centres  is  
denoted with →. If the Path is bi-directional then ↔ is used.
For a better understanding of the Symbol of Life, please refer to 
the various paintings on the Symbol at the end of this introductory 
chapter. Consult the appropriate painting in order to get familiar 
with the numbering of the Centres and the Paths on the Symbol, 
as well as on our body-bodies. Always bear in mind that you are 
studying a Living Symbol and not a mere mental construction.
Man has Seven ‘Bodies’ or rather Seven Vehicles for expressing 
his  Spirit-Soul-Ego  Self  in  the  Seven  Heavens  or  Universes,  
that are in Absolute Unity: the Gross Material, the Etheric, the 
Psychical, the Lower and Higher Noetical, the Noetic and the 
Super-Noetic Body. The latter two are rather to be considered as 
States of BE-ingness. 
The reader is advised to study Daskalos’ book ‘The Symbol of 
Life - Das Symbol Des Lebens’ (1998).

91
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
The  Symbol  of  Life  is  a  composite  Pan-Universal  Archetypical  
Living  Symbol  regarding  the  manifestation  of  the  
ABSOLUTE 
BE-INGNESS LIFE.
 It depicts the multiple states of Consciousness 
and  Self-awareness  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  God  involved  in  the  
Genesis of the Cosmos, the manifestation of the various Archangelic 
Orders and of the Human Being, the Heavenly Man.
1. Introduction
Observing the Symbol of Life, we can see that it consists of: 
(a) Colour-Lights, in a variety of combinations and shades.
(b) Geometrical shapes, such as Arches, Triangles, Circles, Squares, 
Stars and many more simple or composite symbols. Some of 
these circular shapes are called Centres. 
(c) Connections  between  the  different  Centres,  which  are  called  
Paths.
The Colours
These are: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple in all tones and shades, as 
well as Black, and White.
The Ten Holy Centres
The  Ten  Holy  Centres  are  aligned  along  Three  Vertical  Columns,  
Pillars or Paths. These Centres are Centres of Consciousness or Self-
awareness, or both.
They comprise one Great Triangle at the top of the Symbol of Life, and 
Nine Circular Centres, three in each Column.
All  Centres  bear  a  Holy  Number  from  1  to  10,  which  denotes  the  
vibrational state of the centre, as well as the work undertaken in each 
individual centre. The Great Divine Triangle as well as its Three Lesser 
Triangles bear the Number 1.
Centres 6, 9 and 10 are situated on the Central Column.
Centres 2, 5 and 8 are on the Right Column.
Centres 3, 4 and 7 are to be seen on the Left Column.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
92
If we picture the Symbol of Life on a flat surface, the Centres look like 
Circles or Disks. 
However,  if  we  visualise  the  Symbol  of  Life  as  a  three-dimensional  
figure, then the Circles are perceived as Spheres.
The Paths
We can see Three Vertical, Three Horizontal and Ten Diagonal Paths 
on the Symbol of Life.
Between these paths and centres, Triangles, Squares, and Pyramids are 
formed.
Between  the  vertical  central  path,  and  the  three  horizontal  paths  
between Centres 2↔3, 4↔5 and 7↔8, Three Crosses are to be found. 
When  viewed  from  the  descending  point  of  view  (from  Centre  1  
downwards), the First Cross is at the level of Centres 2 and 3, but if 
we assume an ascending standpoint (from Centre 10 upwards), then 
the First  Cross  would  be  one  that  is  defined  by  the  path  connecting  
Centres 7 and 8. It is only a matter of numbering in an ascending or 
descending order.
Some of these paths are for Ascending, some are for Descending, and 
some are Both.
2. Description
The Symbol of Life is surrounded by the colour black. 
From the colour black, Light-Life will emerge and Primary Motion will 
be expressed.
The black colour represents our inability to perceive reality. For us it 
is the lack of perception of the reality of the Absolute BE-ingness in 
Its Static State, and therefore in Its Divine Self-Sufficiency; a State of 
Absolute Eternal Motion devoid of any kinesis or movement, which is 
movement without moving, and vibration without anything vibrating.
In this Static State, Absolute BE-ingness Divine Will-Pleasure appear; 
How?  Through  the  creation  of  vibration  and  movement.  “And  God  
said,  Let  there  be  light:  and  there  was  light”  –  the  Mind  Super-
Substance,  the  Light  of  the  LIGHT  and  the  Light  within  the  LIGHT  
and  the  holy  instrument  of  the  Absolute  Infinite  BE-ingness  God  to  
manifest Itself in Itself. This is denoted by the Great White Arch at the 
top of the Symbol of Life.

93
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
Through  Motion,  that  Primary  Kinesis  or  Movement  appears  which  
gives us Light. And thus Light becomes the expression of the Absolute 
BE-ingness,  the  Pan-Universal  Logos  and  the  Holy  Spirit.  This  
complex and magnificent work is further depicted by the Five White 
Lesser Arches and the Two White Semi-Circles connected to the Great 
Holy Triadic Triangle at the top of the Symbol of Life.
Here, Light is expressed in three ways: Motion-Kinesis, Movement and 
Vibration.  This  becomes  apparent  on  the  two  pathways  at  the  sides  
of the Symbol of Life; the Logoic on the right and the Holy-Spiritual 
on the left, as well as in the Great Golden-yellow Triangle of the Holy 
Trinity at the top of the Symbol, which is common to both Logoic and 
Holy-Spiritual  expression.  The  Great  Triangle  symbolises  the  Total  
Wisdom, Total Power and Total Love of the Absolute BE-ingness God.
We  see  the  black  colour  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  in  the  Inverted 
Triangle  at  the  top  of  the  Middle  Column,  underneath  the  first  
horizontal path between Centres 2 and 3, as well as in Centres 2 and 8.
Three Columns, Pillars or Paths corresponding to the Descent of the 
Holy Trinity originate from the Great Triangle. The Central or Middle 
Golden-yellow  Column  represents  the  Direct  Descent  of  the  Father, 
whereas  the  Right  Column  is  for  the  Descent  of  the  Pan-Universal  
Logos and the Left one for the Descent of the Holy Spirit.
The Right Column and all its Centres (2, 5 and 8) are embedded in the 
Golden-yellow Light of the Pan-Universal Logos, while the Left Column 
and all its Centres (3, 4 and 7) are bathed in the Purple Light of the 
Holy Spirit. 
Outside the Symbol on the Right side we can see the Red colour, whereas 
on the Left side we observe the Purple colour.
Purple is the Holy-Spiritual Fire and Red is the Logoic Light.
In essence, the Left side is under the domain of the Holy Spirit and the 
Right side under the domain of the Logos.
The  Archangel  Michael  (Ma-Kha-El)  is  eternally  connected  to  the  
Logoic  Light  and  the  Archangel  Raphael  (Ra-Pha-El)  to  the  Holy-
Spiritual Light.
We can see White-rosy Light around Centre 6 of the Heart, and Sky-
blue Light around Centre 9 of the Solar Plexus.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
94
The Centres and the Paths
The Centres of the Right Column belong to the Logoic Expression of 
the  Absolute  BE-ingness,  the  Centres  on  the  Left  Column  belong  to  
the  Holy-Spiritual  Expression  and  the  Centres  of  the  Middle  Column 
belong to the Absolute BE-ingness, God the Father.
From  the  Right  Column,  we  have  the  descent  of  the  Sons  of  God 
(Guardian Archangels) and the Sons of Man.
From the Left Column, the Archangelic Powers and the Holy-Spiritual 
Monads descend into the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom etc.
The Centres of the Right Column are points of descent for our Spirit-
Ego  Self,  until  our  incarnation,  which  takes  place  at  Centre  10,  the  
lowest centre.
The Centres of the Left Column are points of descent for the formless 
Holy Spirit and the Archangelic Powers.
Therefore,  both  Right  and  Left  Columns  are  paths  of  descent,  of  
powers and expressions of the Absolute BE-ingness.
The Central or Middle Column is the direct descent of the Absolute 
BE-ingness, God the Father, down to the Material World.
We Human Beings begin our journey back Home, our ascent back to 
the Father from Centre 10, the lowest centre.
We have Three Ascending Ways at our disposal.
Firstly,  we  have  the  Central  Column,  which  is  the  main  ascending  
Column  for  Human  Beings  (10→9→6→1).  On  this  path  we  shall  
encounter the phenomena of Life, but also the real Life of the Absolute 
BE-ingness.  On  this  path  we  shall  also  express  our  Logoic  Self-
awareness, so as to perceive what we really are as a Spirit-Soul-Ego 
Self. We shall receive Holy-Spiritual Consciousness, which will give 
us direct conscious and super-conscious contact with all phenomena 
of Life. 
This Central Column in our material body is equivalent to our spinal 
column.
Secondly,  we  have  the  Right  Ascending  Column  as  the  Path  10→8.  It  
is the Ladder of Twelve successive Trials and Initiations and our road 
towards  freedom  from  the  burden  of  our  present-day  personality  
petty self.

95
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
As we have already mentioned, the Right Column is both ascending 
and descending; ascending for us Human Beings, and descending for 
the Light which enlightens every Human Being coming into the world.
Finally,  the  Left  Holy-Spiritual  Column  is  also  both  ascending  and  
descending (3↔4↔7↔10). It is ascending for the ascending Human 
Being;  it  is  Jacob’s  Ladder  with  the  twelve  steps  (10→7).  Through  
this  ladder,  we  come  into  contact  with  the  Archangelic  Orders,  sub-
consciously at first, consciously as teachers, and Super-consciously as 
semi-Gods.
3. The Centres
Centre 1 – The Centre of the Great Divine Triangle
The upright Great Holy Triangle symbolises the Absolute BE-ingness 
in Its Absolute Expression – The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit 
– as far as it is possible for humans to understand It.
The small Inverted Triangle in the middle of the Great Triangle divides 
the Great Triangle into Three Smaller Triangles in golden-yellow light.
The Upper Lesser Triangle in the Great Triangle symbolises the Absolute 
BE-ingness, God the Father, and on the human body it is situated as 
an etheric centre above the head.
The Right  Lesser  Triangle  symbolises  the  Pan-Universal  Logos  and  
meets Centre 2, which consists of the Holy Monads. Macrocosmically, 
it  is  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  in  its  Omnipresence,  yet  to  descend  in  
Centre 6 as the Pan-Universal Christ Logos.
The Left Lesser Triangle  symbolises  the  Omnipotent Holy Spirit  and  
meets Centre 3, where all the Archangelic Orders can be found: Thrones, 
Principalities, Orders, Michaels, Raphaels, Gabriels, Uriels, and many 
more known and unknown to us, in their Archangelic Hypostasis and 
in the formless Holy Spirit. 
The Central Inverted Triangle with the black colour on the top and the 
red and purple colours underneath is the starting point for the path 
of  descent  of  God  the  Father  into  Creation.  From  here,  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness descends in Its Will-Pleasure (God in Expression), within 
Its Divine Selfhood (God in Its Causal State). This first path begins at 
the top of the Central Inverted Triangle, from the area of the Static black 
colour. The path continues downwards until it reaches Centre 6, the 
central  position  of  the  Noetic  Sun  symbolised  as  a  Six-pointed  Star  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
96
with a red Cross. In the human body it corresponds to our heart.
This  Inverted  Triangle  also  corresponds  to  the  two  hemispheres  of  
the brain in the human body. The right hemisphere is the Logoic side 
of the brain and the left is the Holy-Spiritual side of the brain. The 
dark parts divide Self-awareness and Consciousness at the Absolute 
BE-ingness level, so that our memories of past experiences are forgotten 
from incarnation to incarnation, thus activating the merciful Law of 
Oblivion.  The  events  are  forgotten  but  not  lost,  since  we  can  access  
them again in the first stages of Theosis.
Centre 2 – The Centre of the Holy Monads
Holy Monads beyond number represent the Multiplicity or Plurality of 
the Absolute BE-ingness and are depicted as Red Spots with a central 
Black Dot. The Black Dot is the Static State of the Absolute BE-ingness, 
and for Man it symbolises our Innermost Self (the Spirit-Ego Self ). The 
Red Spot symbolises our Eternal Hypostasis, which derives from our 
Hypostatic  Nature,  i.e.  our  Natural  ability  to  express  our  Innermost  
Self in Creation. These two spots are united as one Holy Monad.
Every Holy Monad projects billions upon billions of immortal Holy 
Monads into the Worlds of Creation – all the Archangelic Orders and 
Archangel Man.
The path between Centres 2 and 3 is bisected by the Central Column, 
thus forming for the ascending Man the Third holy Cross (if viewed 
from Centre 10 towards Centre 1).
The  Centre  of  the  holy  Cross  is  not  visible.  It  unites  our  higher  and  
lower nature. In our body it corresponds to the cerebellum.
Centre 2 is connected to three Paths: 
(a) The Horizontal  Path  (2→3),  towards  the  left;  the  burning,  
Archangelic Path. 
(b) The Vertical Descent (2→5); the Path of Light, from which the 
Holy Monads will descend. 
(c) The Diagonal  (2→6),  towards  Centre  6;  the  Path  of  Fire  and  
Light.  This  Path,  in  principle,  is  only  for  ascending  from  
Centre 6 towards Centre 2.
Centre 2, on the human body, is situated above the right shoulder in 
our etheric body.

Centre 3 – The Centre of the Great Lightning
In  this  centre,  the  Holy  Spirit  and  the  Archangelic  Orders  conceive  
of the Will-Pleasure of the Absolute BE-ingness to manifest Itself in 
Itself.  Thus,  they  co-vibrate  their  own  free  Will-Pleasure  with  the  
Great  Work  to  be  undertaken.  The  Great  Lightning  is  the  Mind  as  
Super-Substance  that  is  about  to  invigorate  the  majestic  World  of  
Ideas, Laws, Principles and Concepts of Centre 4, so as to manifest the 
Forms and subsequently the multitude of living forms beyond number.
From this Holy-Spiritual Centre, there are no entities for incarnation. 
But there are Brother Archangels from the Order of the Thrones, one 
for each of us, who will pass from Centre 3 back to Centre 2 and thus 
become a ‘Metathronios’ - an Archangel after the Throne, in order to 
guide us and be with us in our incarnations as our Guardian Archangel. 
Additionally, Seven more Archangels, each one belonging to a different 
Order, will accompany us as ever faithful workers sustaining all our 
bodies  throughout  the  entire  cycle  of  our  incarnations:  a  Michael,  a  
Raphael, a Gabriel, a Uriel and three more Archangels. 
Centre 3, on the human body, is above the left shoulder in our etheric 
body. 
Centre 4 – The World of Ideas, Laws, Principles, Concepts and
Forms
The  Great  Lightning  has  descended  into  this  centre  and  the  Holy-
Spiritual Monads are co-vibrating with the World of Ideas and all that 
is within Creation, in order to unceasingly manifest the multitude of 
forms  in  all  kingdoms  of  Life.  Here,  the  Holy  Spirit  works  directly  
and not through the Archangels.
This Holy-Spiritual Centre 4, on the human body, is situated under 
the left armpit.
Centre 5 – The Centre of the Idea of Man or Heavenly Man
Here,  we  encounter  the  Idea  of  Man,  the  Archangel  Man,  in  Its  
Hypostatic Nature, meaning our Nature in Expression. This centre is 
in  golden-yellow  light  like  all  the  other  centres  on  the  Right  Logoic  
Column, and consists of a Red upright Triangle with a red Cross in it.
The  Triangle  is  the  Triadic  Nature  of  Man,  reflected  as  the  Triads  of  
Spirit-Soul-Personality   and   of   Noetical-Psychical-Gross   Material   
Bodies.  The  Cross  symbolises  the  Four  Elements  (Ether,  Fire,  Water  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
98
and  Earth)  in  a  harmonic  union  and  balance  (here,  they  are  only  in  
their Noetical State).
From  this  centre,  we  receive  our  Permanent  Atom,  comprising  the  
Triad  our  Permanent  Noetical  Atom  (Fire),  our  Permanent  Psychical  
Atom (Water) and our Permanent Material Atom (Ethereal). Note that 
the Permanent Atom is One in Three and yet the Three are One. 
From the right vertical path, we come to Centre 8, dressed as Permanent 
Atoms with all the vibrations of matter; not to incarnate yet, but for 
creation, to build-up our Self-aware state.
Centre 5, on the human body, is situated under the right armpit.
Centre 6 – The Centre of the Christ Logos as a Six-pointed
Star – The Centre of the Heart and of the Permanent
Personality Self-aware Self
Centre 6 is the symbol of the Pan-Universal Christ Logos, the Noetic 
Sun denoted as the golden-yellow Six-pointed Star with a red Cross in 
it. It is also the Centre of the Heart and of our Permanent Personality 
Self-aware Self. The symbol is bathed in a white-rosy light.
The  Sun  signifies  the  warmth  of  the  Unconditional  Love  of  the  
Pan-Universal  Logos,  whereas  the  warm  white-rosy  light  denotes  
the Unconditional Love of the Pan-Universal Christ Logos, as it was 
expressed by Joshua Immanuel.
The  upright  Triangle  of  the  Six-pointed  Star  symbolises  the  Holy  
Trinity  in  Its  Divine  State,  whereas  the  inverted  triangle  is  the  
manifestation of the Holy Trinity in Creation.
The  red  Cross  stands  for  the  Law  of  Tetractys  (the  Law  of  the  Four  
Elements)  in  expression  in  the  third,  fourth  and  fifth-dimensional  
world,  and  beyond.  The  Cross  –  every  Cross  –  also  symbolises  the  
balance  between  Self-awareness  and  Consciousness.  Similarly,  we  
have  to  balance  the  concept  of  all  pairs  of  opposites  such  as  Good  
and Evil or Pain and Pleasure etc., by maintaining a mid-point stance 
between  the  two  opposing  poles.  Thus,  the  balance  between  our  
material,  psychical  and  noetical  bodies  is  accomplished.  This  work  
may also be symbolised as a perfectly balanced equilateral triangle.
Here,  on  the  Cross,  the  Second  Crucifixion  will  take  place;  we  will  
come  into  ‘At-one-ment’  with  the  Pan-Universal  Christ  Logos,  after  

99
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
receiving the Baptism of Fire. We will enter ‘Christo-eno-aesthisia’ (a 
composite Greek word ‘Χριστοενοαισθησία,’) which means to become 
One  with  the  Christ  Logos,  to  become  assimilated  with  the  Christ-
Consciousness. We will be able to express our Permanent Personality 
Self-aware Self. This is the work of many incarnations; to unite the 
Higher Noetical with the Lower Noetical World via the balancing of the 
Four Elements. Here, the present-day personality is attuned with the 
Ego Super-consciousness, and this is the triumph after the crucifixion. 
This  process  is  represented  in  the  Old  Testament;  Moses  (the  Ego-
Soul Self ) will unite with Rebecca (the unity between the present-day 
personality and the Permanent Personality). 
Here, we will also find Hermes Trismegistus. In the heart, there will be 
the transformation in Spirit and Fire.
The  First  Resurrection  of  our  present-day  personality  took  place  on  
the First Cross at the middle point of Path 7↔8, on our way to Centre 
6 from Centre 9. At our First Crucifixion, we denounced our time and 
place ‘petty little self’, our weaknesses and unbridled desires. 
Macrocosmically,   Centre   6   symbolises   the   Noetic   and   Noetical   
Universes.
Mesocosmically, it represents the noetical counterpart of planet Earth, 
and all the noetical counterparts of other Solar Systems, Galaxies etc., 
which vibrate according to the Four Elements.
Microcosmically,  this  centre  symbolises  our  noetical  body  and  its  
etheric double. 
Centre 6, on the human body, is the material heart.
Centre 7 – The Centre of the Seven Flames
In this centre, the Seven Red Flames symbolise the Seven Archangelic 
Orders working in the mundane and in our bodies.
The  Holy-Spiritual  energy  descends  from  the  Left  Purple  Column  
into  this  Centre  of  Fire.  According  to  Greek  mythology  here  is  the  
workshop of Hephaestus.
Through  this  centre,  the  Holy-Spiritual  expression  of  Life  sustains  
our material body. From here the Holy Spirit transfers Etheric Vitality 
through our etheric body to both our material and psychical bodies. 
The etheric Centre 7 is situated in the area of the spleen.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
100
Centre 8 – The Centre of the Soul
Inside it is a small Red Circle and a Black Spot in the middle. This Red 
Circle is tangential to a Red straight horizontal Line. It is the symbol 
of our Soul, as well as of Man before his incarnation.
The Black Spot is our Divine Nature, our Spirit-Ego Self.
The Red Circle symbolises the Eternity of our Hypostasis.
The  two  ends  of  the  Red  Line  indicate  our  Divine  Nature  and  our  
Human Existence. The Red Line per se denotes the three worlds of the 
mundane. 
So, a combined interpretation of the symbol signifies that our Spirit-
Ego Self, clothed in an Eternal Hypostasis, is expressed in the Noetical, 
Psychical and Gross Material Worlds, bearing our Divine Nature and 
our Human Existence.
Centre 8, on the human body, is situated in the area of the liver.
Centre 9 – The Centre of the Five-pointed Star and the Crescent
Moon – The Centre of our Present-day Personality
From Centre 8, our Spirit-Self descends to incarnate in Centre 9 of the 
Psychical World, to dress the psychical body.
Macrocosmically, it symbolises the Psychical Universe.
Mesocosmically, it represents the psychical counterpart of planet Earth, 
and  all  the  psychical  counterparts  of  other  Solar  Systems,  Galaxies  
etc., which vibrate according to the Four Elements.
Microcosmically,  this  centre  symbolises  our  psychical  body  and  its  
etheric double. 
In Centre 9 we enter into our Self-aware Hypostasis, into the emerald 
kingdom  of  our  Psychical  World,  which  is  surrounded  by  the  sky-
blue light of Gabriel (Kha-Vir-El). Here, we have the 49 sub-planes of 
the Psychical World.
In Centre 9, we will find the blue Crescent Moon as the Law of Duality 
and  the  Five-pointed  Star  symbolising  our  present-day  personality  
self-aware self. It is situated in the solar plexus of our body. 
The Five-pointed Star is under the domain of the Archangel Gabriel.
The upright white triangle of the Star symbolises our Divine Nature 

101
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
and the other four golden-yellow triangles denote our Logoic Nature.
Here, we have the five wise and five unwise virgins of the parable.
The Crescent Moon gives us the perception of two opposing states; the 
dark and the light, the hells and the paradises in the Psychical Worlds, 
which we enter through the Five-pointed Star.
Here, our present-day personality self-awareness will live through its 
first experiences in the Psychical Worlds.
In this centre, in the etheric double, we have the subconscious, which 
concerns  the  present-day  personality  self-awareness  with  all  the  
world of elementals.
Most  of  the  work  is  done  in  the  solar  plexus.  Here,  forgiveness  and  
purification of the present-day personality self will take place.
Moving up from Centre 9 towards Centre 6, we must balance within 
us  the  number  7  (4+3),  the  Tetractys  and  the  Triangle,  once  we  have  
first overcome the unfavourable influences of Number 5, according to 
the parable of the five wise and five unwise virgins.
Centre 10 – The Centre of Gross Matter and of our Material Body
From Centre 9 we will descend through the Central Path to Centre 10, 
the lowest centre. Here, we will be finally clothed in matter and obtain 
our material body. Now, our Descent into the Gross Material World 
is complete.
In this centre, we can find a Four-sided Pyramid and two triangles; one 
upright and the other inverted. This is the Law of Tetractys (the Law 
of the Four Elements) in expression in the three-dimensional world. 
The Four-sided Pyramid will eventually become our workshop.
Macrocosmically, it symbolises the Gross Material Universe.
Mesocosmically,  it  represents  planet  Earth  in  its  etheric  double,  and  
all  the  other  Solar  Systems,  Galaxies  etc.,  with  their  etheric  doubles  
which vibrate in relation to the Four Elements.
Microcosmically,  this  centre  symbolises  our  material  body  and  its  
etheric double. Here, we have a body and a conscious existence, but 
not yet self-awareness. Now in Centre 10, Man is in his material state 
in the three-dimensional world.
Centre 10, on the material body, is situated in the area of the genitals.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
102
In Centre 10 the Three Columns of the Symbol of Life converge, acting 
upon us, but also serving as ascending scales.
Here, we can see the positive and counter-positive currents as electric 
and magnetic fields. The red right side is the electric and the purple 
left side is the magnetic energy. Here, the two electromagnetic currents 
meet and dominate, Fire and Light merge together.
Regarding our ascent from Centre 10, bear in mind that when we pass 
through  the  various  steps,  we  are  not  moving  in  place,  but  through  
states.  For  example,  on  the  three  steps  on  our  way  from  Centre  10  
to  Centre  9,  we  have  to  become  masters  of  our  etheric  double,  of  
meditation and reason. 
We also have our ascent from the right side, from Centre 10 to Centre 
8.  This  ascent  concerns  the  Twelve  Labours  of  Heracles  (Hercules-
Ἡρακλῆς,  in  Greek)  where  our  job  is  to  purify  our  present-day  
personality. We will come back to this later.
Finally, on the left column, we encounter the Twelve Stair Ladder of 
Jacob  (Path  10→7).  This  is  a  difficult  ascent  towards  the  Archangelic  
Orders  of  Fire.  On  this  path,  we  will  come  into  contact  with  the  
Powers,  which  are  in  our  etheric  doubles.  We  have  to  overcome  the  
various trials and initiations these Powers bestow upon us and thus be 
able to attune with them. We will encounter the Divine Power of the 
Archangels and we will gradually meet Them on the Path from Centre 
10 to Centre 7, which begins at the left side of our pelvis and ends at 
the left side, at our armpit.
So, Centre 10 is, let us say, the point of departure for our present-day 
personality’s ascent through the etheric double, that will develop and 
be  expressed  in  the  following  Centre  9,  which  is  the  solar  plexus;  
the main accumulator of our etheric double, which is situated in the 
etheric double of our Material World.
Inevitably, Man must use all the paths in order to obtain experience.
4. The Right Path 10→8 of the Labours of Heracles
Centre 10 to Centre 8 is an ascending scale with twelve steps. We have 
to pass many different tests or tribulations. Each step is a purification 
of our psycho-noetical body.
Each  step  is  a  task  and  a  trial  which  ends  in  victory  throughout    

103
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
our  continuous  struggle  for  the  development  of  our  present-day  
personality.
Ever  standing  by  our  side  is  our  Guardian  Archangel.  On  the  first  
steps, Archangel Gabriel is always present, whilst on the last steps, we 
will meet Archangel Michael.
Therefore, this is a process leading to the purification of our present-
day personality, which in ancient Greek mythology is symbolised by 
the Labours of Heracles.
To  begin  with,  let  us  see  who  Heracles  was.  The  hero  was  the  son  
of  Zeus  (the  Absolute  BE-ingness)  and  of  Alcmene,  who  symbolises  
the Idea of Man and its manifestation in the Worlds of Duality and 
Separateness. Therefore, Heracles is the manifestation of an Immortal 
God  clothed  with  the  Idea  of  Man.  Heracles  is  our  Innermost  Self,  
after passing through the Idea of Man. 
The first spiritual event in his life is the confrontation with the two 
snakes, which are the two electromagnetic currents that arise from the 
Sacred Fire at the base of the spine, at the coccyx. When intertwined 
and  in  combination  with  the  Central  Column,  they  comprise  the  
Caduceus of Hermes, the symbol of the mystic.
The  strangulation  of  the  snakes  in  the  cradle  indicates  the  hero’s  
Divine Nature, through which he becomes the master of the two Paths; 
the Logoic and Holy-Spiritual – even though he is still in the lowest 
centre, Centre 10.
Ancient Greek mythology points out that Heracles sinned by wishing 
to  incarnate,  and  therefore  he  was  under  the  command  of  his  first  
cousin  Eurystheus  and  had  to  carry  out  his  every  wish.  Eurystheus  
was the King of Mycenae, representing the Absolute BE-ingness in Its 
Will-Pleasure as a Logoic expression, as well as the Keeper of the Law 
of Duality and Separateness in the worlds of the mundane.
Heracles is destined to reach a State of Theosis, to leave his ‘petty little 
self’  behind  and  to  reach  immortality,  his  Divine  Nature.  We  are  all  
Heracles.
Ancient Greek mythology distinguishes twelve labours. However, we 
as Researchers after the Truth in the gross material plane concentrate 
on  the  first  ten  labours,  for  the  fulfilment  of  our  ascent  on  the  right  
side.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
104
5. The Twelve Labours of Heracles
1. The First Labour (killing the ferocious Nemean Lion) refers to the 
annihilation of anger, wrath and rage.
This   labour   concerns   Man’s   struggle   to   prevail   over   his   
incapacitating  habit  of  anger.  The  lion  represents  anger.  Anger  
does  not  belong  to  psychical  states,  but  is  a  kind  of  expression  
of  our  present-day  personality.  It  is  a  negative  state  which  gains  
life from our egoism. There is no excuse for anger. Anger is not a 
power,  but  a  weakness.  Real  power  is  to  be  calm  and  to  proceed  
with our development. When we become angry, we do not succeed 
in any way.
This  labour  pertains  exclusively  to  the  present-day  personality.  
We  will  have  no  support  from  our  Guardian  Archangel.  The  
hero  will  find  the  lion  in  a  cave,  which  means  our  body  and  its  
subconsciousness. From inside the cave, which is in a dark forest, 
we  can  hear  the  roaring.  Heracles  uses  both  his  hands  to  kill  
the  lion  by  strangulation.  The  hands  symbolise  the  noetical  and  
psychical bodies (reason and emotion, which are controlled by our 
Soul-Self ). We will use these to ‘kill’ the egoism of our present-day 
personality.
Heracles then skins the lion-anger and wears its pelt as an armour. 
Although  we  have  ‘killed’  our  anger,  because  of  the  environment  
we live in, we must wear the lion’s pelt as a disguise. Since we no 
longer  express  anger,  we  must  not  lead  others  into  thinking  that  
we are weak. The pelt will give us protection.
If anger is the characteristic of the uninitiated, then the lion’s skin 
is the dignity of the initiated; the dignity of our Innermost Self.
2. The Second  Labour  (killing  the  multi-headed  Hydra  of  Lerna)  
relates to the control over our desires. 
3. The Third Labour (killing the Stymphalian Birds) concerns work 
on a special type of elemental dwelling in our subconscious. 
4. The Fourth   Labour   (capturing   the   Golden-horned   Hind   of   
Ceryneia, which was sacred to the Goddess Artemis) concerns our 
material body; we have to become masters of our material body, 
by carrying it as the Law of Cause. 
5. The Fifth Labour (capturing the Erymanthian Boar) addresses our 
uncontrolled egoism.

105
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
6. The Sixth  Labour  (cleaning  the  Stables  of  Augeas)  concerns  our  
subconsciousness (which is the stables), where dirt in the stables 
corresponds to the stains in our subconsciousness. We must clean 
out these ‘stables’ by diverting the ‘two rivers,’ into passing through 
the stables, and thereby, clean the ‘dirt.’ The two rivers symbolise 
the  two  electromagnetic  currents  and  the  water  is  psycho-etheric  
energy, which will cleanse our sub-consciousness.
7. The Seventh  Labour  is  to  capture  the  Cretan  Bull.  Here,  the  bull  
again symbolises egoism, in this case the ego-personality. The sea 
or Poseidon symbolises the Psychical World. 
8. The Eighth Labour (capturing the man-eating Mares of Diomedes) 
concerns  our  egoism,  which  is  Diomedes,  and  the  four  mares  
(horses),  which  are  the  Four  Elements  in  a  destructive  state.  The  
mares’ feet symbolise the Law of Tetractys. Man has to learn not 
to misuse the Four Elements in his bodies, because this brings a 
lot of pain. 
9. The Ninth Labour is about obtaining the Girdle (belt) of Hippolyte, 
the Queen of the Amazons. The Amazons symbolise our psycho-
noetical centres. Hippolyte symbolises the present-day personality. 
The golden belt is the connection between our three bodies via their 
corresponding  etheric  doubles.  This  belt  symbolises  our  control  
over  the  Etheric  Vitality  in  our  three  bodies  and  our  mastery  of  
Energy in the solar plexus. Once we have become masters of this 
belt, beyond the domain of our bodies and etheric doubles, we will 
then become masters of the ability to perceive eternity.
10. The Tenth Labour (driving the Cattle of Geryon) is similar to that 
of  the  capturing  of  the  mares  of  Diomedes.  Geryon  symbolises  
our egoism in its three expressions in the Material, Psychical, and 
Noetical  Worlds.  When  our  present-day  personality  abuses  our  
Ego, desire drives our Ego crazy. This turns our Ego into egoism or 
selfishness. We as the ‘hero’ have to capture but not kill our egoism 
and make it harmless.
11. The Eleventh  Labour  is  about  obtaining  the  Golden  Apples  of  
Hesperides. The apples symbolise Planets, Stars and Solar Systems. 
We  must  become  masters  of  exosomatosis  beyond  the  psychical  
and noetical planets. 
12. The Twelfth and Final Labour is to capture, but not kill, Cerberus, 
the watchdog of the Underworld. Cerberus had a dog’s body with 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
106
three heads and a dragon’s tail, with emerging poisonous snakes. 
This labour is the most difficult, the most horrifying initiation of 
all. We must descend to the Underworld to meet Pluto, the Ruler of 
the Underworld, and ask for his permission to capture Cerberus, 
the loyal and ever faithful keeper of the gates of this world.
Now,  what  does  Cerberus  symbolise?  The  Law,  which  restricts  
re-entry,  once  we  have  entered  into  the  Psychical  and  Noetical  
Worlds. Cerberus restricts us from re-entering our material body 
and therefore symbolises the keeper of our incarnations.
As mystics we must become the master of our inherent ability of 
Self-conscious  expansion.  We  must  unite  the  memories  between  
incarnations,  between  our  expansions  and  our  exosomatosis,  in  
the Psycho-Noetical Worlds.
Christ said, “If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death” 
(John 8:51), and also “But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing 
here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Kingdom of 
God” (Luke 9:27).

Fundamental Meditation on the Symbol of Life
Preliminary Meditation – Balancing the Bodies
All  exercises  within  this  book  should  begin  with  the  Preliminary  
Meditation which enables us to shake off the burdens of everyday life, 
balance our bodies and prepare ourselves for entrance into higher states 
of consciousness. When practiced alone, the Preliminary Meditation is 
a beneficial morning exercise to centre the personality, energise the body 
and prepare ourselves for the challenges of the coming day.
Preliminary Meditation Exercise
Relax completely and feel your material body.
We have to love and respect our bodies. They are a gift from our 
Father.  Concentrate  and  feel  your  toes...  Be  fully  aware  that  you  are  
now in your toes... Breathe deeply and move very slowly up to your 
knees. Feel and see your etheric double... See it sparkle in and around 
your material body... It is Life!
From  your  knees  move  slowly  up  into  your  abdomen,  into  
your  solar  plexus,  which  is  behind  the  navel...  Breathe  deeply  and  
concentrate on this centre. Inhale and see pure sky-blue light-energy 
radiating from within your solar plexus throughout your whole body. 
Exhale. See all fear, doubt and darkness leave your body. 
Now, move up to your chest... See white-rosy light radiating from 
the place of your heart. Silence your emotions and your desires... Feel 
only love in your heart. Love Life... Love yourself... Love all Human 
Beings. Especially focus your love on those who believe they are your 
enemies. Expand the white-rosy light to cover the whole planet... It is 
your temporary home. As a personality you live on this planet, but as 
a Spirit-Soul the planet lives in you.
Move upwards and see a golden sun in and around your head... 
Clear  your  thoughts.  There  are  only  creative  thoughts  in  your  mind  
now.  See  how  the  entire  etheric  double  of  your  material  body  is  
shining and sparkling in white light... Look carefully and observe all 
the aforementioned colours within the white light. Breathe deeply and 
wish good health for your body.

Working within a Psycho-Noetical Four-sided 
Pyramid – Archangelic Attunement
In many exercises the Preliminary Meditation is followed by Archangelic 
Attunement. In this exercise we construct a psycho-noetical Four-sided 
Pyramid. To build the pyramid, we visualise a large square on a floor 
emitting white light, with an isosceles triangle extending horizontally 
from each side. Each side of the square should be 3-4 metres long. We 
close the pyramid at a point well above our head by pulling up the four 
triangles. The pyramid should be three times your height! Gradually, 
you will become familiar with the construction of the pyramid and it 
will not be necessary to go through all the preliminary assembly phases. 
Then,  you  will  simply  enter  the  Four-sided  Pyramid  and  commence  
working. 
The power of names explicitly describes the work to be undertaken here: 
Pyramid  is  a  composite  Greek  word  (Pyramis-Πυραμίς).  Pyr-Πῦρ  
is  Fire,  Mind-Fire  in  all  states  of  expression;  from  the  flame  of  a  
candle  to  the  superb  Super-Noetic  Inextinguishable  Fire.  Amis-Ἀμίς  
is  the  container,  the  vessel.  Consequently,  Pyramid  –  every  type  of  
Pyramid, and there are many – is the holy vessel of Mind-Fire. So, 
we have to become masters of the Super-substance of Mind-Fire; the 
Holy Outpouring of the Absolute BE-ingness God. This is our ultimate 
objective when we assume work at our starting point in the Four-sided 
Pyramid.

115
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
The  pyramid  has  been  evoked  across  the  ages  in  many  cultures  as  a  
sacred  place  and  a  protective  workshop  for  communion  with  Divine  
BE-ings.  In  Archangelic  Attunement  we  learn  to  cooperate  with  our  
Brothers, the Archangels of the Elements. In many cases, Archangelic 
Attunement is followed by more specific work.
Archangelic Attunement Meditation
Begin with the Preliminary Meditation and continue as follows. 
Look at the floor with your etheric eyes. Use the white light of your 
etheric double to create a square on the floor. See, feel and hear energy 
flow from the fingers of your etheric hand as you fill the square with 
white light. Stand in the middle of the square. Use your etheric hand 
again to create a triangle in front of you... Create another triangle on 
the right side... One on the left... And finally, one behind you. Bring 
the  four  triangles  together  to  form  a  pyramid.  It  is  three  times  your  
size, filled with white light.
Breathe deeply... Look in front of you and see golden light rising 
within the triangle. This is the Light of the Logos. Bend your head in 
reverence before this glorious light.
On your right side see red flames rising within the triangle. This 
is  the  Archangel  Michael.  Open  your  palms  to  receive  a  red  flame.  
Breathe deeply. Your etheric double is slowly filled with Michael’s red 
light. This light does not burn, but instead purifies our blood. Thank 
Michael for His help.
Look to the left side and see violet flames rising in this triangle. 
This  is  the  Archangel  Raphael.  Open  your  palms  to  receive  a  violet  
flame.  Breathe  deeply  and  see  your  etheric  double  become  violet.  
Raphael  gives  you  the  Etheric  Vitality  and  energy  you  need.  Thank  
Raphael for His help. 
There is no need to turn around to see the sky-blue triangle behind. 
The Archangel Gabriel gives you His blessings abundantly.

Our Archangelic Garment or Form
Within God, all BE-ings are equal and differ little from one another. 
Before and beyond our expressions in Creation we, along with all other 
BE-ings, are Holy Monads. From our common home, some assume the 
human form, while others join the Archangelic Orders. In this sense, we 
and the Archangels are Brothers.
When  we  dress  ourselves  with  our  Archangelic  Garment,  our  higher  
consciousness will enable us to better comprehend the human experience, 
become  masters  of  our  bodies,  see  the  heavens  within,  and  perform  
spiritual work.
Many people believe that Archangels have feathery wings that allow them 
to fly. These wings are actually rays and streams of pure energy. In 
assuming our Archangelic Form, we will create these wings. It is Man’s 
prerogative to do so, since he is an Archangel too. He is Heavenly Man, 
he is the one who passed through the Idea of Man, he is Archangel Man. 
Then, our Brethren in Heaven rejoice...
Our Archangelic Garment or Form
Begin with the Preliminary Meditation and continue as follows.
Breathe  deeply.  With  your  etheric  hands  together  out-stretched  
before  you,  mark  a  point  on  the  floor  that  emits  white  light.  From  
this point, use your left hand to slowly draw a straight line of golden 
light along your left side to a point behind you. See, feel and hear the 
light pouring from your hand. Now with your right hand, construct 
an  identical  line  along  your  right  side.  Breathe  deeply  and  visualise  
the golden light forming a third line, which connects the two points 
behind  you.  You  are  now  standing  in  the  centre  of  an  equal-sided  
golden triangle, each side measuring about 3-4 metres in length. It is 
radiating pure golden light... Yet, the floor remains white.
Visualise golden flames rising from the right-side of the triangle 
on  the  floor.  They  embrace  your  right  foot,  come  up  through  your  
right leg and approach your solar plexus from the front, where they 
cross over to the left side of your body. See and feel them rise towards 
your left shoulder, go under the left armpit, turn to the back of your 
body  and  move  in  a  straight  line  to  your  right  shoulder.  From  your  
shoulder, they spread out and upwards as three vibrating, wing-like 
golden flames.

117
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
Now, see golden flames rising from the left-side of the triangle on 
the floor. They embrace your left foot, come up through your left leg 
and approach your solar plexus from the front, meeting the previous 
right  fiery  current.  Hence,  the  flames  cross  over  to  the  right  side  of  
your  body.  See  and  feel  them  rise  towards  your  right  shoulder,  go  
under your right armpit, then turn to the back of your body and move 
in a straight line to your left shoulder. From the shoulder, they spread 
out and upwards as three vibrating, wing-like golden flames. Breathe 
deeply and comfortably.
Raise your etheric arms and place them inside these golden fiery 
wings.  From  the  rear  of  the  triangle  white  flames  begin  to  rise  and  
touch  your  legs  from  behind.  They  ascend  between  your  feet,  pass  
through the genitals, climb up the spine, then finally go up through 
your head, and spread six inches above the top of your head to form a 
brilliant lotus flower. Breathe deeply. From within the lotus a silvery-
white  serpent  wakes-up,  emerges  and  arches  its  head  out  over  your  
forehead, looking forward. Experience this state.
Slowly return to your human form. Dissolve the triangle and pray: 
“God of Life, Love and Mercy. Enlighten our minds to understand You 
as the Truth. Clean our hearts to reflect Your Love towards You and 
towards all other Human Beings! Bless our steps to follow Your Way. 
I  know  the  gifts  You  gave  me.”  Compose  yourself.  Breathe  deeply  
and  slowly  feel  your  material  body:  your  head...  chest...  abdomen...  
thighs... and feel your knees down to your feet.
Further Explanation of the Archangelic Form
(a) We  have  the  golden  flames  coming  from  the  right  and  left  
golden  sides  of  the  triangle  on  the  square  white  floor.  These  
currents of fire and light create the two golden fiery wings on 
our form.
(b) We  have  the  white  light  coming  from  the  backside  of  the  
triangle,  ascending  through  our  feet  to  the  spinal  column,  
resembling  a  torch  of  white  shining  light.  It  opens  up  above  
the  head  like  a  lotus  flower.  From  within  the  lotus  flower,  a  
silvery light rises that looks like a silvery serpent.
(c) We have our body radiating white light.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
118
What are the snow-white body, the golden fiery wings, the inner 
torch  of  shining  white  light  and  the  silvery  serpent  that  vibrates  in  
exultation?  The  different  levels  of  subconsciousness,  consciousness  
and Super-consciousness:
(a) The  lower  part  of  the  body  near  the  solar  plexus  is  instinct,  
subconsciousness and consciousness.
(b) When  the  torch  of  white  light  passes  behind  the  heart,  it  is  
pure emotion, beautiful unconditional Love.
(c) Ascending,   it   becomes   pure   clear   thought   and   generates   
complete Self-awareness.
(d) Above  the  head,  this  white  light  projects  the  fully  awakened  
mystic into the unfathomable realms of Super-consciousness.
Then, we have a bright line of light uniting the two shoulders. Two 
lines of light from the shoulders descend and unite on the solar plexus, 
giving  us  a  downward  pointing  triangle  in  snow-white  light.  In  the  
middle of this triangle is the white-rosy disc of the heart, the cradle 
of Logoic Love, the dwelling of the Christ Logos. Here, the Researcher 
becomes One with the Logos within us (Christo-eno-aesthisia), within 
every Human Being and with the Logos in His Omnipresence.
We have to bring Heaven to Earth. This is the natural course of 
things. The way up, or rather the avenue of our return Home, is very 
well  lit,  as  my  father  used  to  reassure  me  on  many  occasions.  We  
simply have to walk our way back by using our own two feet...

The Colours Around the Symbol of Life in the 
Different Worlds – More on the Three Columns 
“A
S I have said many times, Life is the Absolute BE-ingness, Life is 
Creation, it is we ourselves, and we will study it macrocosmically 
and microcosmically. We cannot understand and perceive the Absolute 
BE-ingness,  Life,  except  through  symbols.  We  should  try  to  do  so  
through our human intellect as much as it is possible. 
We notice the Symbol of Life surrounded by black colour. This is 
the Symbol of Life in the Material World. However, we will also study 
the Symbol of Life in the Psychical, Noetical and Noetic Worlds.
In  the  Psychical  Worlds,  the  Symbol  of  Life  is  not  surrounded  
by  black  colour,  but  by  sky-blue  colour.  In  the  Noetical  Worlds,  it  
is  surrounded  by  a  canary-yellow  colour,  and  in  the  Noetic  Worlds  
(State)  it  is  surrounded  by  golden  colour.  Yet,  the  Symbol  of  Life  
remains the same in all the worlds.
Our Symbol of Life differs from all other systems. It is not coloured 
by  any  superstition  or  by  religious  obsession.  When  we  study  the  
Symbol of Life, we are drawn into the Truth. 
As I mentioned above, we see the Symbol of Life surrounded by 
the  colour  black.  This  is  our  perception  in  the  Material  World.  It  is  
through our intellect and our five senses that we perceive. That is why 
we see the Symbol surrounded by the colour black. However, through 
our intuition, we will see the Symbol of Life surrounded by a sky-blue 
colour in the Psychical Worlds, by a canary-yellow colour in the Noetical 
Worlds and by a golden colour in all the other worlds. We envision 
the Symbol of Life according to our human intellect and perception.”
When  he  said  that,  I  wondered  how  the  different  Archangelic  
Orders see the Symbol of Life. Do all the Archangelic Orders see it in 
the same way? 
“No,”  was  the  answer,  “each  Order  sees  it  from  its  own  vantage  
point. We see it from the lower circle, which symbolises the Earth, as 
we  see  our  Earth  having  deep  green  and  brown  colours.  The  angels  
and Archangels see it from their own circle of existence.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
120
Now,  from  the  Material  World  we  see  the  Symbol  surrounded  
by  black  colour,  which  gives  us  the  Static  State  of  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness.  A  Static  State,  which  encompasses  movement  without  
anything moving..., but we see the Light ascending.
‘And God said, Let there be light: and there was light’ (Genesis 1:3).
Now,  take  a  good  look  at  the  upper  part  of  the  Symbol  of  Life  
and observe the Primary Motion, which gives us Light. Abstractly, it 
makes  a  curve,  a  Great  White  Arch,  and  initiates  the  Triple  Tremor  
as Motion-Vibration-Oscillation. Then the Light becomes expression, 
thus  manifesting  light  in  various  degrees  of  vibrations  and  colours.  
Please observe carefully Centre 1 and the Great White Arch.
We  observe  the  Five  Lesser  Arches  and  the  Two  Semi-Circles  in  
contact with the corners of the Great Divine Triangle at the top of the 
Symbol of Life. There are two Lesser Arches on the right and two on 
the left, while the fifth one covers the apex of the Holy Triangle (that of 
God the Father) and is common to both the Logoic expression and to 
the Holy-Spiritual expression. Under the Five Arches, we see the Two 
Semi-Circles directly adjoining the apex with the right and left corner 
of the Divine Triangle. Thus, the Trinity of the Father, the Son and the 
Holy Spirit further manifests the multiform and inconceivable aspects 
of  Light,  in  order  to  descend  into  the  spheres  or  discs  of  Creation.  
Here, we can recognise the Triple or Triadic expression in One.
On  the  right  side  we  have  the  Logoic  Self  Super-Conscious  
expression touching Centre 2 with the golden-yellow colour, and on 
the left side the Holy-Spiritual Super-Conscious expression vibrating 
and bathing Centre 3 with the violet colour. 
We  now  discern  the  Holy  Triangle  at  the  top  of  the  Symbol  of  
Life, which is the expression of the Absolute BE-ingness in Creation. 
Although it is one big triangle, it is composed of three smaller upright 
triangles and a fourth inverted one. This inverted triangle is divided 
into two parts by the Great Central Pathway of the Absolute BE-ingness, 
as it commences its downward course. 
We see the First and Primary Path of the Central Column, emerging 
from the inverted triangle within the Divine Triangle of the Absolute 
BE-ingness. God the Father is descending directly as the Creator of the 
Worlds.

121
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
The black colour in this inverted triangle denotes the Static State 
of the Absolute BE-ingness. One Holy Triangle, One Trinity, One God; 
in this way, our human intellect will be able to perceive the Trinity, as 
long as we understand the Lord as the Creator of the multi-dimensional 
Universe.
Now,  look  at  the  right  side  of  the  triangle,  which  symbolises  
the  Pan-Universal  Logos.  In  the  lower  part  of  the  triangle  lies  the  
disc  (Centre  2),  which  contains  the  Divine  Holy  Monads.  The  Holy  
Monads  are  in  red  and  their  centre  point  is  black.  The  black  colour  
represents the Static State of the Absolute BE-ingness and symbolises 
our Innermost Self. 
See  the  Divine  Holy  Monads.  Each  one  of  these  Divine  Holy  
Monads will send out many Archangels into the Worlds of Creation, 
including Archangel Man; All being Logoic Archangelic Orders.
Observe the first disc (Centre 2). It is the Logoic expression of the 
Pan-Universal Logos or of the Absolute BE-ingness in Its Logoic Self-
aware Nature. 
See the inverted triangle, which divides the big triangle into three, 
touching the Logoic triangle on the right side. Observe the black colour 
and the red colour. The red colour symbolises the blood of Men who 
will become Souls, Divine Living Entities, our Inner Selves.
On the left side, we see the triangle that symbolises the Holy Spirit 
and  the  disc  with  the  violet  light  that  belongs  to  the  Holy  Spirit.  In  
it  we  see  the  Lightning,  Fire.  There,  the  rulers  are  the  Archangels  of  
Fire (not the Archangel, but the Archangels of Fire). Which Fire? Can 
we call Fire the energy, the vibration that will give us combustion in 
certain material things or the flame, which is the result of combustion?
Pay  attention,  Fire  is  one  thing,  but  flame  and  combustion  are  
something else. Fire is in the Static State of the Absolute BE-ingness, 
as the Archangel Michael in two conditions. We have movement that 
will give us fire, and we have movement that will give us combustion, 
the lightning, which is the expression of the element of Fire.
Here, in Centre 3 are the great Archangels of Fire, the Lords who 
are  purely  Holy-Spiritual.  Between  Centres  2  and  3  we  see  the  Path  
of the Logoic Self-aware Nature, which separates the downward Path 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
122
(the Central Column) and gives us the First Cross from the descending 
point of view. Path 2→3 continues until it meets the disc that symbolises 
the Holy-Spiritual Super-conscious Nature of the Holy Spirit. Do you 
know what that means? In the Logos, we have the Absolute Self-aware 
Nature. You may wonder if the Holy Spirit has a Selfhood or not. Do 
the Archangels not have their own Self-aware Nature? The answer is 
both ‘Yes and No.’
Our Self-aware Nature is individuated when we pass through the 
Idea of Man or Archangelic Man. What does individuated mean? Are 
the Archangels of the different Orders not individuated? The answer 
again is ‘Yes and No.’ What is the difference between Them and us?
All the Archangels are Divine, Eternal BE-ings like the Archangel 
Man, but with one difference. When Archangel Man passes through 
the  Idea  of  Man  and  becomes  individuated  he  acquires  a  separate  
existence, while the Archangels, individuated through the Holy Spirit, 
do  not  have  a  separate  existence.  They  are  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  
in  expression;  even  though  each  one  of  the  Archangels  is  a  separate  
BE-ingness,  They  are  not  aware  of  it.  They  know  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness  as  Their  Self.  This  is  what  gives  the  Archangels  Their  
Holy-Spiritual Nature. They are our Brethren, who did not leave the 
Father as us Prodigal Sons did.
We  descend  from  the  Centre  of  the  Holy  Monads,  which  is  on  
the Right Path, to the centre with the upward pointing triangle, with 
the  Cross  in  the  middle  (Centre  5).  There  lies  the  Idea  of  Man  and  
our threefold Nature. Just like God is threefold as God the Father, the 
Pan-Universal Logos and the Holy Spirit, so we are threefold as well. 
As above in the Heavens, so below on Earth.
What  does  the  Cross  in  the  disc,  in  Centre  5,  symbolise?  It  
represents the Four Elements: Ether, Fire, Water and Earth. The symbol 
of  the  Cross  existed  long  ago,  before  the  crucifixion  of  our  Beloved  
One  on  the  wooden  cross.  It  appears  among  the  ancient  Egyptians,  
Aztecs,  Incas  and  Hindus,  and  symbolises  the  harmonious  union  of  
the Four Elements in Creation.
We see that the Path continues downwards and now takes on the 
red colour (which is not visible). This red colour eventually creates our 
blood. We descend and see the symbol of Man before his incarnation 
(Centre 8).

123
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
Therefore, we see three stations on the right side. These concern 
the descending process along with hidden powers.
Now, looking at the Middle Path, we encounter the path descending 
from the big upward pointing triangle. On the right side, it descends 
through the black colour and the red colour, which again symbolises 
blood. On the left side we see the black colour, the Static State of the 
Holy Spirit, and the violet colour which symbolises the Holy Spirit.
Focus  on  the  Central  Column;  it  gives  us  the  triangle  of  the  
Absolute  BE-ingness  in  its  first  Absolute  Expression.  Then,  we  see  
again the Static State through which the path descends, reaching the 
position  where  we  face  the  Noetic  Sun  (Centre  6).  Its  symbol  is  the  
Six-pointed Star, with the Cross in the middle again. If we observe, we 
will see that this centre has many paths leading in different directions.
From Centre 2, from the Divine Logos, we spot the path descending 
from our Absolute Conscious Self-aware Nature straight down. This 
path is the colour yellow. The Path of the Absolute BE-ingness from 
the Middle Column downwards is also yellow. On the left side from 
the Holy-Spiritual Sphere and Nature, we see light violet, deeper violet 
and  brownish  colours  descending.  These  three  Paths  are  the  sacred  
aspects of our Nature.
However, we can also view other Paths descending from Centres 8 
and 7. One Path from Centre 8 to Centre 9 is purely Self-aware (Logoic), 
and  thus  it  relays  our  Self-awareness  from  the  Idea  of  Man  (Centre  
5), via our Soul-Self (Centre 8) into the present-day personality self-
aware  self  (Centre  9).  The  other  Path,  from  Centre  7  to  Centre  9,  is  
purely Holy-Spiritual. Observe the colours, they are almost similar. If 
we proceed on the Middle Path with the yellow colour below Centre 6, 
we will see Centre 9 in emerald green colour with the Crescent Moon 
and the Five-pointed Star in it.
There lies the symbolism of our present-day personality self-aware 
self. Our Permanent Personality Self-aware Self is above in Centre 6 of 
the Noetic Sun. Our material body resides at the lowermost point of 
the Symbol of Life, Centre 10.
On  the  Central  Column  of  the  Symbol  of  Life,  we  have  seven 
positions.  Which  are  these  seven  positions?  On  the  Symbol,  we  can  
only spot five.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
124
The first two are indistinguishable and belong to the Great Divine 
Triangle: 
The first  position  is  at  the  mid  point  of  the  base  of  the  inverted  
triangle within the Divine Triangle. On our gross material body and 
its etheric double it corresponds to the seventh sacred disc above our 
head.
The second position relates to the centre of the First sacred Cross 
between Centres 2 and 3, which is also the mid point of the base of the 
Great  Divine  Triangle.  This  position,  although  invisible  to  the  plain  
eye on the Symbol of Life, is the centre of the Cross which unites our 
Higher Nature with our lower nature.
If we place the form of Man on the Symbol of Life, this invisible 
position will be situated at the cerebellum, ‘The flaming bush which 
is not burning.’ Our head is above the First holy Cross. Now, see our 
head  in  the  downward  pointing  triangle.  On  the  Logoic  and  Holy-
Spiritual side, these two positions give us the two lobes of our brain. 
The  one  part  of  our  brain,  the  right  part,  is  on  the  Logoic  side,  and  
the other part of our brain, the left part, is on the Holy-Spiritual side. 
Yet, because the Symbol of Life constantly oscillates, we have its right 
part corresponding to the left side of our material body and vice versa, 
according to the position of the oscillation. It is as if we are wearing 
an oscillating Symbol of Life.
The other five distinguishable positions on the Central Column of 
the Symbol are:
1. The  middle  point  of  Path  4→5,  corresponding  to  the  thyroid  
gland and the throat
2. Centre 6, corresponding to the heart
3. The middle point of Path 7→8, that corresponds to the common 
locus of the abdominal and thoracic discs, i.e. the lower part 
of the sternum
4. Centre 9, corresponding to the solar plexus
5. And finally Centre 10, corresponding to the genital area
Now, let us return to the Holy-Spiritual Super-consciousness in 
Centre 3 which touches the triangle of the Holy Spirit at its lower left 
apex. Here, we see the symbol of the Lightning, the expression of Fire. 
Here,  in  this  centre,  we  will  see  all  the  Archangelic  Orders.  All  are  

125
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
there, but it is through the Path towards the Self-aware Nature of the 
Logos (3→2) where we will see Archangels passing and entering into 
the Divine Holy Monads, and from there commencing Their work in 
the human body-bodies.
Therefore,  the  Archangels  in  their  pure  and  Absolute  Nature  are  
in  Centre  3,  which  gives  the  Holy-Spiritual  Super-consciousness.  
Thrones,  Principalities,  Authorities,  Michaels,  Gabriels,  Raphaels,  
Uriels  and  all  other  Archangelic  Orders  reside  here  in  their  pure  
BE-ingness, before passing and entering to work in Creation.
Observe Centre 2 of the Symbol of Life. In the Self-aware Absolute 
Nature of the Pan-Universal Logos, we see red spots, and their centre 
point in black, symbolizing the Holy Monads. These Divine Monads 
have  Their  own  form  of  BE-ingness  because  They  are  Self  Super-
consciously aware Divine Monads, BE-ings, Entities. They are complete 
Entities. They will project to manifest and express Themselves in the 
different  worlds.  Archangels  will  also  project  from  the  same  Divine  
Holy Monad towards the left Holy-Spiritual side.
In Centre 4, the centre below Centre 3 of the Great Lightning, we 
encounter Lightning once again and everything we find in Creation: 
Animals,  plants,  birds,  etc.;  all  is  of  Holy-Spiritual  origin.  Moving  
down, we see the Holy-Spiritual Centre 7 with the Seven Flames. ‘God 
who  maketh  his  angels  spirits;  His  ministers  a  flaming  fire’  (Psalm  
104:4).
We see three main Paths of descent:
1. On  the  right  side,  the  Absolute  Self-awareness  of  the  Pan-
Universal Logos
2. In  the  Middle  Path,  the  direct  descent  of  God  the  Father,  
providing all levels of Consciousness and Self-awareness
3. On the left side, the descent of the Holy Spirit in expression, 
as the provider of all phenomena in Creation, including all our 
bodies
Now,  we  see  and  study  the  Symbol  of  Life  from  two  different  
vantage  points;  both  macrocosmically  and  microcosmically.  What  
exists in nature, also exists in Man because Man, as a material body 
and in all his other expressions, is similar to the Absolute BE-ingness 
even in his expressions in Creation.

We  have  to  study  every  position  or  centre  separately,  mainly  in  
our  material  body.  If  we  place  the  form  of  Man  on  the  Symbol  of  
Life, we see the right part of the head in the Absolute Super-conscious 
Self-aware Nature of the Pan-Universal Logos, the middle point of the 
First sacred Cross on the cerebellum and the left part of the head in the 
Absolute  Holy-Spiritual  Super-conscious  Nature  of  Man.  Therefore,  
right from the very beginning we are Logoic and Holy-Spiritual.
Christ Logos is the Life-giver, ‘By whom all things were made,’ the 
Logos,  the  Light  which  enlightens  every  Human  Being  coming  into  
the world. But the Holy Spirit is also a Life-giver, ‘the Lord and Giver 
of Life.’
Which  is  our  position  in  the  big  upward  pointing  triangle  that  
symbolises the Absolute BE-ingness in Its first expression? Our head 
does  not  touch  the  upper  part  of  this  triangle;  the  triangle  is  above  
our  head.  See  the  two  lobes  of  the  brain,  Holy-Spiritual  on  the  left  
and Logoic on the right... However, the head does not touch the two 
centres;  on  the  right  we  have  the  Absolute  Self-aware  Nature  of  the  
Pan-Universal  Christ  Logos  (Centre  2),  and  on  the  left  the  Absolute  
Holy-Spiritual Super-consciousness (Centre 3). These two centres and 
the upper triangle of the Great Triangle on the Symbol of Life do not 
touch the material body, but are situated above the shoulders.
Our first Self-conscious contact with Life is at the first holy Cross, 
where the two Paths between Centres 2 and 3 unite with the third Path, 
the Descending Path on the Central Column. This point corresponds 
to the cerebellum. 
When  Man  develops  and  ascends,  he  will  hear  the  Voice  of  his  
Lord, his God, and he will see the flaming bush that is not burning.
Do you remember what I said to you a long time ago about Moses? 
Decode the symbolism. When Moses ascended the mountain to talk 
to his God, was he alone or with his wife Rebecca? What does Rebecca 
symbolise?  The  present  and  Permanent  Personality  Self-aware-Self,  
and Moses symbolises the Ego-Soul Self-aware Self.
  According  to  the  story,  we  see  that  Moses  had  protection  from  
the  seven  daughters  of  the  king  of  the  desert,  but  he  got  married  to  
Rebecca,  the  eldest.  The  Seven  Sisters  symbolise  the  Seven  Centres.  
Count them; Centres 4-5-7-8-9-10 and Centre 6. Rebecca symbolises 
love,  material  love,  the  present-day  personality  self-aware  self,  and  

127
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
this is in Centre 6, in the heart. Consequently, Centre 6 is the centre 
with  the  upward  pointing  triangle  and  the  Cross  in  the  middle  
balancing the Elements. 
From Centre 6, the Ego-Soul Self with the present and Permanent 
Personality  will  ascend  directly  up  through  the  Middle  Path  and  
reach the cerebellum, the flaming bush, which never burns. When the 
personality is purified, it unites with the Ego-Soul Self-aware Self. 
Coming down, we see the Centre of the Crescent Moon and the Five-
pointed Star, Centre 9. On the human body, this centre corresponds to 
the  solar  plexus.  Further  down,  we  find  the  whole  body  of  Man  in  
Centre 10. 
Gradually,  you  will  learn  how  to  spread  your  hands  in  the  
Symbol of Life and get blessings. You will learn through meditation, 
observation  and  creative  thinking  how  to  go  through  the  holy  Paths  
and ascend to Christ-Consciousness and Theosis. 
Every one of us as a phenomenon of Life will work on the Symbol 
of  Life  until  we  see  the  Sun  of  Life  rising  up  within  us,  no  longer  
through our human intellect, but through Divine Ecstasy. We will not 
come  to  know  the  Symbol  of  Life  through  noetical  perception,  but  
through assimilation and oneness with our Higher Nature. Until then, 
we must make contact with all the Archangelic Powers working in our 
material  body.  They  unceasingly  build  our  material  body  for  us,  in  
which currently we live by mercy and not by right.
When we know our Brethren the Archangels in Their expression, 
we will then realise how much They love and care for us. It is because 
of Their work, that we live and we will ascend. We belong to the race 
of  Men.  The  Archangels  are  a  System,  and  so  is  the  Holy-Spiritual  
expression in Its entirety. If you can recollect, once I told you that the 
Holy-Spiritual Nature of the Absolute is and is not individuated. I had 
pointed out the need to distinguish self-awareness and consciousness. 
You cannot know the difference, unless you experience it from within 
as  self-awareness  and  as  consciousness,  because  you  have  both  
conditions within you. There are so many things I wish to share with 
you about the Symbol of Life!”
That moment a thought crossed my mind: The one who descended 
from Heaven is already an eternal BE-ingness. How can this Self be 
liberated from its noetical expression in time and place?

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
128
We should always remember that the existence of the present-day 
personality has a beginning and an end...
It  seems  my  father  was  reading  my  mind  again  because  he  
instantly explained, “We have mentioned in a lesson that the present-
day  personality  is  an  expression  in  time  and  place.  This  expression  
will not be saved, but it will remain as memory in the Pan-Universal 
Consciousness, in the Pan-Universal Mind.
We descended from Heaven. But we will be ‘saved,’ meaning that 
we will return! The Prodigal Son will eventually return and he will not 
wear the dirty, filthy clothes of a swine guard anymore, since he will 
be dressed with ‘The First Form or the First Garment.’ He will leave 
behind what is unclean. Time and place dirt will be dissolved because 
they are not real, they are mere shadows.
Light  casts  a  shadow,  as  long  as  there  is  an  object  in  front  of  it.  
When  the  surface  on  which  the  shadow  can  be  seen,  does  not  exist  
anymore,  what  remains  is  pure  Light.  It  is  this  Light  which  shall  
ascend. The material body will not return. Flesh and blood will not be 
saved and inherit the Kingdom of God, nor will the shadow be saved.”

Centres and Paths of the Symbol of Life
O
N another occasion my father gave this lesson to me, elaborating 
further on the Symbol of Life.
“We  have  to  see  the  Symbol  of  Life  in  the  different  worlds,  that  
is in the Material World, in the Psychical World and in the Noetical 
World. Beyond these worlds it is no longer a Symbol, but Life itself. 
We see the Symbol of Life surrounded by black colour. The black 
colour is not darkness, but Light. The black colour is a vibration we 
are  not  able  to  perceive  through  our  optic  nerves.  It  is  Super-Light.  
When  I  say  Super-Light,  I  do  not  mean  psychical  or  noetical  Light,  
but the Light beyond.
Centre   10   in   the   Material   World   symbolises   planet   Earth.   
Macrocosmically,  Centre  10  also  symbolises  other  planets,  other  
heavenly  bodies  similar  to  our  planet.  For  this  reason,  do  not  think  
that  macrocosmically  only  planet  Earth  is  in  Centre  10.  On  us,  this  
centre  symbolises  the  body;  specifically  the  pelvic  area,  the  genital  
organs and the feet.
Even  though  it  is  the  lowest  centre,  it  stands  for  creation  in  the  
Material  World.  Here  we  will  see  duality.  Upon  saying  duality,  I  do  
not mean the positive and negative state, but the positive and counter 
positive one. These two different and apparently opposing aspects of 
duality cooperate in absolute harmony.
Let  us  take  for  example  our  left  and  right  foot.  Our  two  feet  
give  kinesis  and  movement  to  the  body  by  constantly  interchanging  
polarities. Suppose that we want to walk. We lift our right leg and take 
the first step with our right foot, while the other one is carrying all our 
body weight. Then all our body follows our right leg and gradually the 
centre of gravity is displaced and our weight is transferred to the right 
foot. Upon completion of this step, the left foot that was assuming our 
weight is relieved of its burden and takes over the process of walking. 
The  same  cycle  is  repeated  many  times.  Should  we  decide  to  run  or  
walk at a different pace, then the rate of exchange of the two polarities 
accelerates  or  decelerates  accordingly.  When  we  choose  to  stand  
still, then both feet equally assume the burden of our weight and the 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
130
two  polarities  remain  in  a  latent  state,  until  the  moment  we  choose  
to  move  again.  This  is  just  one  pattern  of  motion  in  Centre  10,  its  
characteristic being kinesis and movement in the three-dimensional 
world of duality.
We also have duality in the two sides of the pelvis. We find it in 
the genital organs as well. In men, the two testicles represent duality 
and the penis in the middle, as a third factor, promotes equilibrium 
between the other two. Thus, we a have union and harmonisation of 
opposites through a third state. Similarly, in women, the two ovaries 
represent  duality,  and  the  womb  makes  for  equilibrium.  We  find  
duality  and  a  third  factor,  to  give  us  perfect  balance  by  acting  as  a  
mediator between opposing poles.
Hence,  we  realise  that  the  triple  manifestation  of  the  Symbol  of  
Life in the worlds of the mundane begins at Centre 10. What work is 
undertaken here? Centre 10 is dual. In the front of this centre we have 
the genital organs and at the back we have the Sacred Fire. Therefore, 
the Sacred Fire in the coccyx is in this centre, but remains invisible. 
Centre 10 is the seat of material Life. People fail to understand the 
importance of this centre and have the tendency to underestimate and 
scorn the Gross Material World. Here, the Absolute BE-ingness God 
presents the  ultimate  manifestation  of  the  Worlds  of  Ideas-Laws  and  
Causes. Holy Matter is the consolidated reflexion of all higher Universes 
that act upon it. Centre 10 resembles a fertile field where all sorts of 
beautiful  flowers  and  trees  grow  in  abundance.  But  where  do  these  
phenomena  of  Life  or  living  forms  derive  from?  The  essence  of  this  
humble field is to all receive, accept and assist growth. So, observe and 
study all living forms beyond their three-dimensional expression...
The Absolute BE-ingness, the Holy Spirit and the Christ Logos are 
ceaselessly supervising this centre. If we look, we will see three paths 
connected  with  this  centre.  On  the  right  side,  in  pure  golden  light,  
there is the influence of the Christ Logos. Christ said, ‘I am the way, 
the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me’ 
(John 14:6). The Way, the Truth and the Life refers to the Descent into 
Creation,  since  these  three  are  essential  for  the  manifestation  of  the  
phenomenon  of  Life  on  Earth.  But,  for  Man,  they  also  represent  the  
Ascent to God the Father, the return of the Prodigal Son from Centre 
10 up the Central Pathway of the Symbol of Life, via the Christ Logos 
at Centre 6.

131
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
The Middle Path descends directly from the Absolute BE-ingness, 
and again is of pure golden light. The Left Path with the emerald green 
colour, and higher up, the brown-reddish or violet colour gives us the 
expression of the Holy Spirit in descent. 
In  Centre  10,  Three  Powers  meet.  These  Three  Powers  are  the  
Absolute BE-ingness, the Logos and the Holy Spirit. The Central Path 
with  its  Centres  represents  real  Life  and  the  phenomenon  of  Life.  It  
is  Self-awareness  and  Consciousness  (Centre  6,  Centre  9  and  Centre  
10). The three centres on the left side and on the right side pertain to 
Power-Energy, Purpose, and Logoic and Holy-Spiritual expression. 
I want you to focus on the Middle Path, which represents the spine 
in  your  material  body.  Ascend  from  your  pelvis  to  the  next  centre  
and  find  the  golden  light  in  the  Five-pointed  Star  that  symbolises  
the  present-day  personality  self-awareness.  Here,  is  the  seat  of  your  
personality self; you see the deep blue Crescent Moon. In your material 
body this centre is represented by the solar plexus. Here, is your first 
contact with the planes and sub-planes of the Psychical World. 
Concentration on the point behind your navel, in the solar plexus, 
allows  your  personality  self-awareness  to  be  projected  into  the  
Psychical World. Pay attention to the quality of your vibrations. You 
might face unpleasant conditions, which you have previously created 
and which Divine Mercy has kept locked, to give your personality-self 
the chance to progress.
Macrocosmically, in this centre are the ‘paradises’ and the ‘hells’ 
in the Psychical World. Remember what I have said to you: In order to 
have the Material World and its psychical counterpart, there must be 
the Psychical World. Nevertheless, if the Material World, the material 
planet, or the material body is dissolved, the Psychical World with its 
planes and sub-planes will remain intact.
In  the  same  way,  when  our  material  body  decomposes  after  its  
so-called  death,  our  personality  self-aware  Self  will  retire  into  our  
psychical  body  residing  in  Centre  9.  Centre  9  gives  us  the  Psychical  
World as an expression, but not as the Principle or State from which 
this world derives.
Now,  move  up  the  Middle  Path  as  far  as  the  golden  light  goes.  
Ascending, we will see that this path is divided in two and gives us the 
First Cross, the First Crucifixion. This is our cross, but we will proceed 
to Resurrection after being crucified. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
132
Resurrection  will  take  place  in  the  next  centre,  Centre  6,  which  
is  symbolised  by  the  Sun.  There  we  will  find  the  Six-pointed  Star.  
Concentrate more on the upward pointing triangle with the Cross in 
the middle. The Cross symbolises the balance of the Four Elements, 
Fire, Water, Air and Earth. The clear red colour stands for purification, 
but also symbolises our blood.
In  the  previous  centre,  in  the  solar  plexus,  Centre  9,  we  have  
consciousness and the lower part of our consciousness, which is our 
subconsciousness.  However,  here  in  Centre  6  we  have  pure  Logoic  
Self-awareness. 
Here, we attune to our real Ego-Self. We can call it Super-conscious 
Self-awareness. Going up the Central Column, where will it lead us? 
It will not lead us to any centre. Here is the Second Cross of salvation, 
which leads us where? To Theosis!
I would also like you to observe the two Paths (6→5 and 6→4), on 
the  right  and  on  the  left,  in  relatively  darker  colours.  Additionally,  
observe  another  two  Paths  (6→2  and  6→3)  on  the  right  and  on  the  
left of Centre 6 that cross the Rectangle underneath the Great Divine 
Triangle, which is defined by Centres 2, 3, 4 and 5. The red colour on 
the right side of the Rectangle adjacent to Centres 5 and 2 symbolises 
blood,  as  well  as  our  Hypostasis.  On  the  left  side  of  the  Rectangle  
contiguously to Centres 4 and 3 there is the violet colour, symbolising 
power  and  energy.  Colour  black  at  the  upper  part  of  the  Rectangle  
denotes our Absolute Nature.
We now realise how much work must be undertaken in Centres 
9  and  6  in  order  to  attain  full  attunement  with  the  Noetic  Sun  that  
resides in Centre 6.
In Centre 9, we will work towards the purification and balancing of 
our present-day personality. Moving up to Centre 6, after purification, 
great triumph comes. Here, we become attuned to our Soul-Ego Self 
and  ascending  upwards  into  the  golden  light  of  the  Logos,  we  will  
become the living symbol of the Six-pointed Star of our Soul-Self. We 
will  be  in  ‘At-one-ment’  (absolute  attunement  and  unification)  with  
the Absolute BE-ingness, the Logos, the Holy Spirit, the Archangelic 
Orders, the World of Ideas, Principles or Concepts.
Going  from  Centre  6  to  Centre  5  on  the  Right  Path  with  the  red  
light,  we  find  the  triangle  with  the  Cross  in  the  middle.  Here,  we  
see Heavenly Man; the Idea of Man. Higher up (in Centre 2), we see 

133
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
the  World  of  the  Holy  Monads  from  which  we  have  emanated  and  
descended. The two Centres 5 and 2 are full of golden light. As we can 
observe, there is no path towards the Absolute BE-ingness. From up 
there, there is only descent, but no ascent.
Our ascent is the Middle Path, from the Earth upwards. We can 
move  on  the  Right  Path,  which  is  purely  Self-aware  and  Logoic.  It  
is  our  way,  our  home.  We  can  also  move  on  the  Left  Path  with  the  
emerald  green  and  later  the  violet  colour-light,  but  this  is  a  very  
difficult  path.  The  Holy  Spirit  uses  this  path  to  descend  into  our  
material body. We can ascend this path and enter the Holy-Spiritual 
Fire. However, not so very often. We can also see the path, which leads 
us  to  Centre  7,  the  Centre  with  the  Seven  Flames.  This  centre  is  the  
workshop  of  the  Archangelic  Powers,  specifically  of  the  Archangels  
Michael,  Gabriel,  Raphael  and  Uriel.  In  Greek  mythology  it  is  the  
workshop of Hephaestus, the God of Craftsmanship and Fire.
Going up from Centre 7 to Centre 4, we see the Holy Spirit working 
directly, and not through the Archangels. Here in Centre 4, the Ideas 
are  expressed  by  the  various  Archangelic  Orders.  We  see  animals,  
plants and every living form; all are purely Holy-Spiritual. All these 
living  forms  irrespective  of  size  are  granted  by  the  Holy  Archangels  
a  kind  of  instinctive  consciousness  or  sensitivity,  but  definitely  not  
self-awareness. 
Higher up, Path 4→3 is more difficult than the previous one (7→4), 
since it is used for the descent and the expression of the Holy Spirit 
in the Worlds of Creation. We will not deal so much with these paths 
in our material body.
Undeniably, very demanding is the path that leads to Centre 3, the 
Great Lightning and Fire. Here, is the Lord of Hosts after the Throne; 
He is conceived of as something between the Archangel Michael and 
the  Absolute  BE-ingness.  We  can  call  him  the  Archangel  after  the  
Throne. 
Some  earthly  teachers  have  ascended  and  descended  this  Path  
4→3, being consciously in contact with the Archangelic Orders. Thus, 
they have consciously become Children of Fire.
All of us must consciously become such teachers, become Children 
of Fire and receive Holy-Spiritual Grace. If we want to become teachers 
like them, our main work is first in Centre 9, which is the solar plexus 
in our material body. We have to come into contact with our present-

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
134
day personality self-awareness, namely that part of ourself, which is 
called subconsciousness. There is a lot of work to be done there. 
Now, look at the right side of our material body where the liver 
is. It corresponds to Centre 8, the centre of the Soul bathed in golden 
light. Then, look at the left side of our material body where the spleen 
is. It corresponds to Centre 7 with the Seven Flames. The spleen is the 
relatively darker centre on the Left Holy-Spiritual Column. The Holy 
Spirit  uses  this  centre  to  transfer  Etheric  Vitality  from  our  etheric  
double to our material body. From the aspect of the Material World 
we  perceive  this  centre  as  darkish,  because  we  cannot  yet  grasp  the  
Super-Light. 
Now look. Under our right and left armpit, there are two Centres 
(5  and  4)  we  can  concentrate  on  for  certain  work.  However,  the  two  
upper centres, Centres 2 and 3, do not touch our material body. They 
are on our etheric double, above our shoulders on the right and left 
side of our head.
Our head centre is Logoic as well as Holy-Spiritual. Feel the two 
lobes of your brain. The one on the right side is in the Logoic golden 
light, but also in the red light of the triangle that points downwards 
and  separates  the  path  in  the  Great  Divine  uppermost  Triangle.  The  
one on the left side is in the Holy-Spiritual golden light, but also in 
the violet light of the downward pointing triangle that separates the 
path  in  the  Great  Holy  Triangle.  Below  at  the  middle  point  of  this  
path, between the two lobes of our brain, is the cerebellum; this is the 
Tree of Life, the burning bush that does not burn and is not consumed 
by Fire.
Look at the two black parts of the downward pointing triangle in 
the Great Holy Triangle. Here, according to the Law of Oblivion, Self-
awareness  and  Consciousness  are  separated  so  as  to  ensure  that  the  
knowledge of our past experiences in the different worlds will not be 
transferred to our present waking consciousness. If we want to have 
access to our past life experiences, we have to bridge the gap between 
the worlds, and the only way to do it is through meditation.
We should focus on the Middle Column of the Symbol of Life and 
work on the three main centres. In this way we will become the master 
of the centres and the paths, and move through them freely.
I hope that one day we shall be able to repeat His words, ‘All power 
(authority) is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth’ (Matthew 28:18).”

135
Centres and Paths 2 and 3 
Our Guardian Archangel 
Balancing the Holy Numbers 3, 4, 5 and 7
“O
N the right side of the Symbol of Life, in Centre 2, there are the 
Holy  Monads.  The  Holy  Monads  are  the  Multiplicity  of  the  
Pan-Universal Logos. In each of these Divine Monads reside countless 
BE-ings beyond number. Hence, in the Divine Holy Monads we find 
the Multiplicity of the Christ Logos. As is the Father, so is the Son. 
As we see, in Centre 2 there are three paths. The one path on the 
right side with the golden light, is the path through which the Holy 
Monads will descend to pass through the Idea of Man, to be humanised 
and incarnated in the Material World. 
On the other fiery path towards the left, from Centre 2 to Centre 3, 
there are the different Archangelic Orders - BE-ings, projections of the 
same Holy Monads, just like us. Then, there is the path from Centre 2 
to Centre 6, of Light and Fire, which is not a path for descent, but for 
ascent from the Noetic Sun in Centre 6, up to Centre 2.
On the left side, the Holy-Spiritual side, there are again countless 
Divine  Monads,  Archangelic  Orders.  They  remain  invisible  and  
unexpressed.  That  is  why  the  Holy  Spirit  is  impersonal.  We  do  not  
find  Divine  Holy-Spiritual  Monads  for  incarnation.  However,  each  
one of us has an Archangelic Brother from the Order of the Thrones, in 
Holy-Spiritual Centre 3. This Archangelic Brother stands by our side, 
helps us and loves us, but He does not suffer as we do because He is 
not dressed in psychical super-matter. We will meet Him at the time 
of our Theosis. 
When we project from our Divine Holy Monad and start to descend 
as  BE-ings,  our  Guardian  Archangel  will  come  across  the  fiery  path  
from the Holy-Spiritual side, from Centre 3 to Centre 2, to accompany 
us and henceforth be identified as a ‘Metathronios’ Archangel. Such is 
His love for us, that He will be ‘Egofied’; in other words He will attain 
a perfect attunement with our Spirit-Ego.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
136
Descending, we will be connected with our Guardian Archangel. 
At the time of our descent as a BE-ing for incarnation, this brotherly 
BE-ing descends with us, but He is not the same as us, although He is 
‘Egofied’ with us. He is our Guardian Archangel. From the time of our 
descent to the time of our ascent, for ages on end, He will co-exist with 
us. He will stand by our side, He will help us and feel our sorrows.
You may say, ‘But above you mentioned something different.’ Yes, 
he is not dressed with psychical super-matter so as to be attuned to 
the emotions of our personality. He is dressed with the human form. 
This means that He knows and feels our emotions, but He does not 
experience them like we do.
If we meet our Guardian Archangel, we will see him in a human 
form.  We  will  discover  that  He  looks  exactly  like  us  because  He  is  
always  coordinated  with  us.  We  descend  together,  like  twins.  But  
which  one  has  the  leading  role,  we  as  a  BE-ingness  descending  for  
incarnation or our companion, the Guardian Archangel? It is we who 
will go through Paths 2→5→8→10 of descent, so we have the leading 
role.  Yes,  He  will  descend  with  us  as  a  Guardian,  a  Protector  and  a  
Companion  all  the  way  down  to  Centre  10,  but  simultaneously  He  
will  directly  descend  as  an  Eternal  BE-ing  -  God  from  the  Central  
or  Middle  Column.  He  will  enter  Creation  via  the  Majestic  Central  
Column, the Way of Descent of the Great Ones: Joshua Immanuel the 
Christ, the Virgin Mary, Father Yiohannan and many other known and 
unknown to us Divine Entities. Our Beloved One described explicitly 
this Divine State of Descent: ‘For I proceeded forth and came from God; 
neither came I of myself, but He sent me’ (John 8:42). 
In doing so, our Guardian Archangel maintains a dual role: Firstly, 
He is fully attuned with us and our mundane life in all our bodies, and 
secondly (deriving from His direct descent from the Middle Column) 
He is the Keeper of the Archetypes and the Laws within us. Thus, He 
works  in  the  present-day  personality  by  always  presenting  what  is  
right  and  just  as  seen  from  a  Divine  vantage  point,  in  comparison  
with the deeds of our petty self. At times, when our unbridled egoism 
runs riot, His usual soft and discreet guidance is transformed into an 
austere  reprimand  that  we  call  ‘the  stings  of  consciousness.’  In  this  
way balance is restored, but only temporarily, until we reach the point 
when finally our egoism is under control.

137
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
What is the benefit of the Guardian Archangel accompanying us 
on our way? What will His benefit be? Will he receive something from 
us? Has he ever left Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total Love? Has He 
ever been sullied? No. But see what happens. Our Guardian Archangel 
co-vibrates  with  the  Logoic  Total  Love  springing  out  from  us  and  
from the people we love. It is not a small thing for Him to be given the 
opportunity to love and to sense happiness! The first characteristic of 
the Christ Logos is Total Love. He is the King of Love. Consequently, 
the benefit for our Guardian Archangel is to love us. 
Later, when we know Him well, we will also love Him once again. 
He will not have any gain from this. However, we will gain by loving 
Him because the one who loves derives the benefit, not the one who 
is loved. 
This is the point where many people make a huge mistake. They 
think that when others love them, they gain. No, we gain only when we 
love. If someone loves us and we cannot love that person on the same 
level, it is harmful because we cannot coordinate with this person and 
subconsciously  we  feel  that  we  are  in  an  inferior  position.  What  is  
valuable, is to love. To be loved? Well, first see if we are worthy of that 
love. If someone loves us and we are not worthy of that love, we will 
become a dissonance in the Universes and in the Divine Logos.”
With these words, I realised Father meant that if someone loves us 
unconditionally, and we love this person egoistically, because of our 
behaviour we are not worthy of that love.
“Thus, together with our Guardian Archangel we will descend on 
the path from Centre 2 to Centre 5. One can say that in Centre 5 (the 
Triangle with the red Cross) we come to express Heavenly Man or the 
Idea of Man, which is already within our Monadic Nature as Spirit-
Ego Self in Centre 2. The red Cross symbolises the Four Elements in 
both  Noetic  and  Noetical  States.  There  we  will  develop  the  Noetical  
Permanent  Atom  as  Noetical  Fire,  the  Psychical  Permanent  Atom  as  
Noetical Water and the Permanent Gross Material Atom in its Ethereal 
State. After passing through the Idea of Man, we will be dressed with 
all the vibrations of matter: material, psychical and noetical. We will 
descend to Centre 8, not to become a BE-ing, but to be in a self-aware 
condition. Centre 8 does not give us our BE-ingness; we are already an 
Eternal BE-ing in the Pan-Universal Logos, in our Holy-Monadic Self. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
138
Pay  attention  to  the  paths  when  we  come  to  Centre  8.  The  outer  
Path 8→10, from the standpoint of the Logos in expression, is only for 
descent, and not for ascent. Then, there is the path towards the left side 
with the reddish light, connecting Centres 8 and 7. From Centre 7, our 
Brethren the Archangels, will come directly to Centre 8 by using Path 
7→8, and each one will endow us with their gifts before we descend 
for  materialization.  Our  Archangelic  Brethren  will  enter  Centre  8  to  
welcome  us.  As  a  result,  in  Centre  8  our  first  subconscious  contact  
with the Archangels takes place as Self-awareness. 
Now,  let  us  take  a  look  at  the  left  side  of  the  Symbol  of  Life,  at  
Centre 4. There, we will see all kinds of forms. We will see a dark form 
of man, animals, plants, birds and serpents as Ideas and Archetypes 
of that species, purely Holy-Spiritual. On the Left Path, this form of 
man descended subconsciously to become the so-called ‘animal man.’ 
Animal  men  were  the  first  cavemen.  They  did  not  have  right  
thinking at their disposal, but only violent emotions. They descended 
and incarnated as cavemen. They were hermaphrodite, and therefore 
not separated into different sexes. 
The sons of God and the Sons of Man descended on the Right Path. 
The Ego-Self of Man passed through the Idea of Man and descended 
as a semi-God according to Greek mythology. They are the members 
of  the  human  race  on  planet  Earth,  who  make  good  use  of  Mind-
thought  as  reason.  They  descended  at  that  time,  they  descend  now,  
and they will always descend on planet Earth and on all other planets. 
What  I  am  telling  you  has  always  been  happening,  and  will  always  
happen at all levels.
In the book of Genesis 28:12 Jacob said, ‘And behold a ladder set up 
on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of 
God ascending and descending.’ In other words he described his vision 
of seeing Gods, Archangels and angels descending and ascending the 
Holy-Spiritual Path 7↔10.
Additionally,  pay  attention  to  the  symbolism  of  Prometheus  
in  Greek  mythology.  Prometheus,  is  the  one  who  descended  to  
teach  animal  man  and  condemned  himself  before  Zeus,  the  Lord  of  
Lightning,  by  giving  these  men  the  Element  of  Fire  in  order  to  help  
them develop into reasoning existences. Fire symbolises the noetical 
and noetic substance and Super-Substance respectively.

139
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
The story says that the Lord of Lightning, Zeus, bound Prometheus 
to a rock, and every day a black eagle came to eat his liver. His liver 
grew  back,  and  the  next  day  the  eagle  returned  to  feed  on  it  again.  
Notice the symbolism. When Zeus bound Prometheus to the rock, it 
meant reincarnation in a human body. The rock symbolises the spinal 
column  and  the  bones,  as  well  as  planet  Earth.  The  ropes  to  bind  
him symbolise the nerves, the arteries and the veins. The black eagle 
represents  Man’s  mishandling  of  the  Five  Attributes  of  Mind-Light,  
inherent in the Law of Separateness and Duality.
Heracles and Prometheus are one and the same person in double 
expression,  the  Ego-Self  and  the  personality.  This  is  the  work  
pertaining to the Twelve Labours. Prometheus exists every moment, 
and Heracles frees Prometheus at any given moment.
In  mythology  we  see  that  Heracles,  the  one  who  descends  from  
Heaven (the Right Descending Path) was the son of Zeus, son of the 
Absolute BE-ingness. His mother was not Goddess Hera (Zeus’ wife) 
but  Queen  Alcmene,  the  Idea  of  Man  in  gross  matter.  When  he  was  
a  baby  he  strangled  the  two  snakes,  which  symbolise  the  two  final  
points of the Left and Right Paths and the mastery over them in Centre 
10.  Thus,  he  became  master  of  electromagnetic  energy  and  so  began  
his initiations on Path 10→8 with the Twelve Labours.
I give you advice to work on ascending the Central Path and the 
Right Path simultaneously. Later, when you reach the degree of a great 
teacher  you  will  be  able  to  ascend  Jacobs’  Ladder  more  easily.  But  
before, you have to gain the right to ascend this ladder. (Maybe, Father 
meant it for us to ascend this ladder as an Archangel).
We  know  that  the  Right  Path  is  separated  into  twelve  parts  or  
Twelve  Labours.  I  want  us  to  study  them  one  by  one  very  carefully  
and to meditate on them. In this way we will gain a lot in our material 
body, but also in our personality self. This is why I said that we have 
to  work  simultaneously  on  both  paths.  Working  on  the  Right  Path  
our  material  body  will  gain,  and  working  in  the  Middle  Path  our  
personality self will gain.
Ascending through the Middle Path we enter the emerald kingdom 
of our Psychical World and the Five-pointed Star. We work there to 
make our personality self a part of eternity. Ascending higher up towards 
Centre  6  and  beyond,  we  balance  Number  7  within  us,  which  is  the  
union of Number 3 and Number 4. Thus, the equal sided uppermost 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
140
Divine  Triangle  symbolises  Number  3  and  thereby  the  Holy  Trinity,  
whereas the Great Square enclosed by Centres 4, 5, 8 and 7 symbolises 
Number 4 and the Law of Tetractys. By balancing the triangle i.e. the 
mundane reflexion of the Holy Triangle, in our personality self-aware 
Self as its three lower bodies (material, psychical and noetical), we will 
be able to move to the Right Path and the Left Path, and consequently 
enter into the meaning of Number 7. Reaching this level means that 
first we have managed to overcome the opposing influence of Number 
5, as a personality petty self. Remember that the five wise virgins had 
enough oil in their lamps when they awaited the bridegroom, while 
the  five  unwise  ones  did  not  have  enough  oil  at  their  disposal.  Oil  
symbolises Mind Super-substance as right thinking and reason. We 
have to place these lamps in our personality self and keep them lit.
In  this  work,  we  will  not  only  see  the  symbolism  of  Greek  
mythology, but also the parables of the beloved Christ. Do you know 
that the Godman Joshua the Christ was aware of Greek mythology? He 
did not come to abolish anything, he came to explain and complete.
Our  work  is  to  balance  the  four  triangles*  comprising  the  Great  
Square  between  Centres  5,  4,  7  and  8,  but  this  work  has  also  to  be  
undertaken down in the Pyramid of Centre 10.
This is the initial work to be done in Centre 10. At the base of the 
Four-sided Pyramid we will feel the bright white radiation. From the 
triangle  on  the  right  side  of  the  pyramid  pours  the  fiery  energy  of  
Archangel Michael (Ma-Kha-El); from the triangle on the left side of 
the pyramid pours the Holy-Spiritual violet light-energy of Archangel 
Raphael  (Ra-Pha-El);  from  the  triangle  at  the  back  of  the  pyramid  
pours the white light-energy of Archangel Uriel (U-Ra-El), and from 
the triangle in front of us pours the golden light and Love of the Logos. 
We feel the Logoic influence in us.
(Note: In order to avoid confusion, please be aware that in some 
meditations  the  light  emitted  from  the  triangle  at  the  back  of  the  
Four-sided Pyramid may be the white light-energy of Archangel Uriel,
* The four triangles composing the Great Square between Centres 5, 4, 7 and 
8 share a common apex; Centre 6 of the Christ Logos. These triangles are: 
Triangle 6, 5 and 4, Triangle 6, 4 and 7, Triangle 6, 5 and 8 and Triangle 
6, 7 and 8. When studied three-dimensionally, this Square is to be perceived 
as a Four-sided Pyramid, similar to the one in Centre 10.

141
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
whereas in other exercises it is the sky-blue light of Gabriel (Kha-Vir-
El). This depends on the work to be assumed.)
When we stand in the bright white light of the floor in the middle of 
the Four-sided Pyramid with our material-etheric body, we are under 
the influence of the energy of Michael, Raphael and Uriel, and directly 
under  the  influence  of  the  Logos.  Where  is  Gabriel?  Everywhere  the  
sky-blue light is. As a personality self we are swimming in His Light. 
Look,  it  is  confined  between  the  Logoic  and  Holy-Spiritual  Path.  In  
the sky-blue kingdom of Gabriel we know what rest and peace mean. 
Now, see the phenomenon of Life in the fiery kingdom of Michael. 
Sense the circulation of the blood in your material body, and feel how 
His energy enriches the blood cells of your body through His warmth 
and balance.
See  the  construction  of  your  material  body,  of  your  veins,  
arteries and of your heart in the kingdom of Raphael. See how many 
Archangelic Orders cooperate in the building of this temple of God, so 
that you can live in it.
I  want  you  to  realise  that  these  are  all  phenomena  in  time  and  
space-place in order for you to become masters of Fire and Ether. But 
do not forget that our nature as a personality self is the Five-pointed 
Star, swimming in the sky-blue light of Gabriel. From there we start 
to live and develop as a personality self-aware Self. In our personality 
self we feel the energy of Michael and Raphael. Pay attention, aim to 
balance  their  energy  in  your  personality  self,  otherwise  it  will  turn  
from creative energy to dissolving energy, to anger and rage.
Step by step, I will guide you to a deep study of the two faces of 
each form of energy, the creative and the dissolving, so that you will 
learn to balance them.”

The Significance of the Law of Tetractys
“T
HE  lowest  centre,  Centre  10,  represents  the  Sacred  Fire  in  our  
material body, but it also represents our whole material body 
as existence in the Material World. Here, Man will be first initiated 
into the great mysteries of the Divine Law of Tetractys. The Tetractys 
or  Τετρακτύς  in  Greek  literally  means  the  congregation  of  the  Four  
Rays.  This  term  was  introduced  by  the  great  mystic  Pythagoras  and  
denotes the gathering and manifestation in supreme harmony of the 
Four Elements (Ether, Fire, Water, Earth) under a Fifth State. 
Initially, we may perceive the Law of Tetractys as:
(a) The Number 4
(b) The symbol of the Cross
(c) The symbol of the Square and of the Four-sided Pyramid. 
Later on, we will realise that this Great Law is also to be found in 
other symbols and numbers less explicitly. At this point, we should be 
able to simultaneously interpret the field of Divine Mathematics, Holy 
Geometry  and  Divine  Symbology  in  conjunction  with  the  World  of  
Ideas, Causes, Laws and Archetypes. What follows, is an elementary 
approach to a complex subject:
Some Symbols of the Tetractys
The Holy Number 4
The Number 4 relates to the 4
th
 letter of the Greek alphabet Δ Delta 
or Δέλτα in Greek. Delta (Δ), relates in a direct way the Number 4 with 
the  letter  Δ,  the  sound  of  the  letter  Δ  and  its  shape  of  an  isosceles  
upright triangle. Observe that these Four are One.

143
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
By further analysing the triangle of letter Δ we may geometrically 
represent it as the gathering of the first four Holy Numbers: 1, 2, 3 and 
4. If you add them up Number 10 derives. Number 1 – the Absolute 
BE-ingness manifests Itself in the Cosmos (0).
The Congregation of the First Four Holy Numbers
The Cross
The  Cross  represents  the  Law  of  Tetractys  or  of  the  balance  of  
the  Four  Elements  in  expression.  Every  Cross  is  composed  by  the  
interception  of  a  vertical  and  a  horizontal  line.  Generally  speaking,  
the  vertical  line  signifies  the  downward  expression  of  Absolute  
BE-ingness in space-place, whereas the horizontal line pertains to the 
concept of time as past, present and future. Yet, if we are to place the 
Four Elements on the Cross, Ether is the upper vertical and Matter the 
lower vertical arm. On the horizontal axis Fire is on the right (when the 
cross is placed on us) and Water on the left. Consequently, we observe 
two  opposing  pairs:  Ether-Matter  and  Fire-Water.  Surprisingly,  the  
Four  Elements  not  only  cooperate  but  they  share  a  common  point  
–  the  centre  of  the  Cross  or  the  Fifth  Divine  State,  from  which  they  
originate. So, although each arm or Element of the Cross appears at a 
distance to or in opposition to its opposite arm, the origin and nature 
of  the  Four  Elements  is  common  to  all  –  it  is  Number  1  the  Father  
and  Mother  of  all  Numbers.  They  came  forth  from  Number  1  so  as  
to  present  Number  4.  The  common  end  is  the  Divine  origin  of  the  
Elements,  or  otherwise  the  Fifth  State  we  mentioned  above,  and  the  
four  apices  represent  their  mundane  expression  in  the  third,  fourth  
and fifth-dimensional world, and beyond. Remember that beyond the 
mundane, the Four ‘opposites’ in reality are One.
Therefore, when we travel on the Symbol of Life we will encounter 
several  Crosses  formed  on  the  Central  Column  where  it  bisects  the  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
144
multiple horizontal lines connecting the opposing centres of the Right 
and Left Columns. We will not then only encounter the symbol of the 
Cross in Centres 5 and 6 but also elsewhere...
Always  bear  in  mind  that  whenever  you  encounter  this  symbol,  
the  same  task  has  to  be  undertaken  but  each  time  from  a  different  
perspective.  We  have  to  balance  the  Four  Elements  as  we  manifest  
them  in  our  present-day  personality.  We  express  the  Four  Elements  
all the time and in all our bodies. Fire dominates in our noetical body 
as thought, Water reins in our psychical body as emotion and Ether 
relates to our etheric body as energy and power. Ether also governs the 
higher noetical body. On planet Earth all Four Elements are present in 
various combinations.
Regarding  the  use  of  the  Elements,  Man  has  the  option  to  use  
them like our Brethren the Archangels do for the benefit of the world 
or combine them in harmful ways. For instance, Fire may be used by 
us to project our thought as reason or it may be used in a harmful way 
against  us  and  others  by  enslaving  it  in  wrath  and  anger.  Water  as  
emotion needs to be tempered with Fire as thought so as to maintain 
equilibrium  between  these  apparently  opposing  forces.  On  planet  
Earth, Matter is eager to consume us and transform us into ‘swine’ as 
in the myth of Odysseus, where Queen Circe (in Homer’s Odyssey) is 
the fascination of Matter. We can only rule over Matter by exercising 
our will over higher Elements, such as Ether, Fire and Water that act 
upon  Matter.  Matter  is  acted  upon  by  all  the  above  Elements.  Just  
remember that elementals are called so, because they are composed of 
all Four Elements. Similarly, we have to balance all pairs of opposites 
such as Good and Evil or Pain and Pleasure etc., which is the drive to 
form an elemental. The choice is ours. 
In  our  life  we  are  free  to  adopt  any  interpretation  we  choose  in  
relation to the various opposing pairs of concepts. We may perceive 
something as evil, whilst another person will adopt a different cognitive 
approach  towards  the  same  thing.  This  decoding  mechanism  of  
personality provides the seed of each elemental we construct. Hence, 
we have to enhance our ‘vision’ so as to discern correctly. Balance is 
maintained if we keep close to the mid-point stance between the two 
opposing poles. We should be indifferent to the enchanting voices of 
the ‘sirens’ of this world, and this most difficult task is achieved if we 
can learn to balance Self-awareness and Consciousness on the Cross 

145
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
or rather Crosses. When we make the sign of the Cross, among other 
things, we also invoke the Divine Law of Tetractys to implement order 
amongst the Four Elements in our present-day personality.
The Square and the Four-sided Pyramid
These  are  additional  symbols  of  the  Law  of  Tetractys.  But  first  
let us examine how they correlate. The Square and its diagonals is a 
two-dimensional  symbol,  but  if  we  examine  it  three-dimensionally,  
the Four-sided Pyramid appears. So, in reality we are referring to the 
same symbol.
Since the Law of Tetractys comes directly from the Holy Trinity, let 
us apply Divine Mathematics and Holy Geometry to acquire a better 
understanding. The symbol of the Trinity is the equal-sided triangle. 
In order to obtain a square, the apex of the triangle opens up giving a 
U shape. Then by God’s Will another Law emerges that unites the two 
loose ends – The Divine Law of Duality and Separateness. Thus, the 
Square is formed in Heaven as the vehicle of the Four Elements, the 
Law of Tetractys. Each side of this Square correlates to an Element.
Henceforth,  all  Elements  that  are  outpourings  of  the  Mind,  will  
gradually  descend  into  this  vehicle  presenting  the  same  Law  of  
Tetractys  in  various  stages  of  expression.  On  our  way  back  to  the  
Father, we have to trace and follow these stages or steps in a reverse 
way so as to return home.
The  Square  and  consequently  the  Four-sided  Pyramid  contain  
the  Cross  in  a  non  apparent  way;  the  diagonals  of  the  Square  form  
an  equal-sided  Cross.  Additionally  to  all  that  has  been  mentioned  
relating to the Cross, the Square presents other properties. It has two 
pairs of opposing or parallel sides and four angles that are the union 
of two sides. So, we have a vertical and horizontal opposition and four 
dual  conjunctions.  All  these  Principles  govern  the  expression  of  the  
Four Elements. The Law and the Principles are eternal and absolute, 
thus it is not permitted to distort the Square into another shape. 
We can see this aspect of the Law of Tetractys on the Symbol of 
Life in Centre 10 and in the Great Square of Centres 4, 5, 8 and 7.
Apart for the Law of Tetractys, in Centre 10 we have all the other 
centres  in  energy,  function  and  expression.  However,  we  see  their  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
146
own distinct characteristics in each one. We must be aware of a Great 
Truth: 
All Centres ARE in all the other Centres as well. We will find 
each and every one of them in all the other Centres, carrying special 
roles with diverse functions. 
For  us,  the  Symbol  of  Life  appears  to  be  surrounded  by  a  black  
background,   symbolising   the   Absolute   BE-ingness   in   Its   Static   
State.  Yet,  we  will  encounter  the  Absolute  in  manifestation  in  All 
Centres. The Absolute BE-ingness is the Central Point of each Centre 
of the Symbol of Life, and of all Ideas, Laws, Principles, Causes and 
Concepts.  Therefore,  this  also  applies  to  the  various  symbols  of  the  
Tetractys, like the Square and the Four-sided Pyramid, that we have 
just  elaborated  on.  Furthermore,  whatever  exists  in  any  one  of  the  
centres  as  a  different  living  form  is  the  expression  of  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness God and obeys the Central Point.
In  Centre  10  we  behold  the  whole  material  body  (as  well  as  the  
Gross Material World) as a manifestation of the Tetractys. Our body 
is a conscious existence, but pay attention, not a self-aware existence. 
When we are in Centre 10, we see the Right Logoic Path. We know 
we have descended, since we are in our material body. In order to meet 
our Self-aware existence, first we have to pass through the Right Gate 
of  the  Tetractys  in  the  Four  sided  Pyramid  leading  to  Path  10→8  of  
the Christ Logos in pure, bright canary-yellow light. We must dare to 
enter the fiery kingdom of Michael in the colour red, through the right 
triangle of the base of the pyramid. In our meditations we must work 
towards  our  ascent  by  mastering  ten  out  of  the  twelve  Logoic  steps,  
which are the Labours of Heracles.
On  the  other  hand,  the  left  Gate  of  the  Tetractys  leads  us  to  the  
Holy-Spiritual  Path  10→7  towards  the  Archangelic  Orders  of  Fire  
working  in  Centre  7.  Here,  at  the  twelve  steps  of  Jacob’s  Ladder  
we  see  the  violet,  brown  and  deep  blue  colours.  In  our  studies,  we  
should  be  able  to  separate  the  different  vibrations  of  these  colours  
in our material body. We need to ascend these twelve Holy-Spiritual 
steps  to  enter  our  Archangelic  Nature.  From  Centre  7  our  conscious  
existence, as well as all the functions of our material body derive and 
are ceaselessly supervised by the Holy Spirit. From this Path (7→10), 
the  creative  ether  flows  down  into  the  Material  World  but  also  into  
our material body.
Entering  Centre  10,  we  partake  in  the  lower  part  of  the  Great  

147
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
Inverted  Triangle,  which  is  formed  by  Centres  7,  8  and  10.  This  is  
the  Holy-Spiritual  and  Logoic  entrance  to  Life  and  Truth.  Thus  the  
mundane  manifestation  of  the  Tetractys  in  Centre  10  relates  our  
existence  to  our  Nature,  by  conjunction  to  higher  manifestations  of  
the same Law in other Centres.
Now, we will not engage ourselves with the downward* pointing 
triangle within Centre 10 symbolising our ultimate descent into gross 
matter,  because  we  are  already  consciously  living  in  our  material  
body. This concerns the work of great mystics who want to come into 
contact with certain kingdoms of existence within planet Earth...
We must focus on the square base of the Four-sided Pyramid, on 
the  Tetractys,  which  symbolises  the  Four  Elements  from  a  slightly  
different point of view. The lower side of this square symbolises Earth 
and Matter. The right fiery side symbolises Warmth and Heat, as well 
our  Self-aware  existence,  but  now  as  Power  and  not  as  expression.  
Eventually, we have to walk outside the Pyramid, on our way towards 
Centre  8.  The  left  side  symbolises  a  state  of  Power  and  Energy  we  
name  ‘Holy-Spiritual  Water,’  our  conscious  existence  as  conscious  
expression. The upper side stands for the Logoic Fire. From the upper 
part of the Tetractys, via the Middle Path, we will enter and proceed 
towards the upward* pointing triangle.
You  must  always  bear  in  mind  that  our  Self-aware  existence  is  
on the right side, whereas our Holy-Spiritual existence is on the left 
side. When we start to meditate on these two sides and on the upper 
triangle,  we  will  see  where  we  stand  as  Self-aware  existence  and  as  
conscious nature and existence. We will then realise the extent of our 
Self-aware  connection  to  the  Christ  Logos  and  our  Holy-Spiritual  
connection to the Holy Spirit. 
We  will  work  a  lot  on  the  Great  Square  (Centres  8-7-4-5),  also  
symbolising  the  Law  of  Tetractys,  on  the  Great  Inverted  Triangle  
(Centres  7-8-10),  on  the  square  base  of  the  Four-sided  Pyramid  in  
Centre 10 that also symbolises the Tetractys, as well as on the upward* 
pointing triangle.
* In Centre 10, outside the square base of the Four-Sided Pyramid, there is an 
upward and a downward pointing triangle. These two triangles are not visible 
on the standard edition of the Symbol of Life, but they are depicted on the two 
unpublished paintings in pages 111 and 112.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
148
In the Great Inverted Triangle (Centres 7-8-10), we will concentrate 
on the middle point (Centre 9) and give glorification to the Logoic side, 
as well as to the Holy-Spiritual side; because the middle point of this 
triangle (corresponding to the middle point of the Five-pointed Star) 
is  the  source  of  Light  of  the  Christ  Logos,  who  gives  Light  to  every  
Human Being coming into the world. This is what concerns us as a 
material  body  and  as  a  living  Entity  before  we  enter  our  Self-aware  
existence. Here, we are still in a subconscious condition.
Yiota, some years ago, you could exit your body through your five 
senses, and come back, receiving impressions through the five senses 
again. Now, you consciously work on introspection in the Kingdom of 
the Heavens, which is within you.
I mentioned that the lowest centre, Centre 10, is sacred and holy, 
as  are  all  the  other  centres  we  know  in  our  material  body  and  its  
etheric double. Additionally, we must also gain abundant knowledge 
relating to all the centres on our psychical body and its etheric double, 
and  on  our  noetical  body  and  its  etheric  double  because  we  work  
simultaneously in all our bodies.
In  the  lowest  Centre  10,  which  is  the  seat  of  the  Sacred  Fire,  
we  give  thanks  and  glorification  to  the  Absolute  BE-ingness,  to  the  
Christ Logos and to the Holy Spirit. Then, we enter into the Tetractys. 
Progressively,  I  will  reveal  to  you  how  to  concentrate  on  the  Four  
Elements:  Earth,  Fire,  Water  and  Ether.  Of  course,  your  first  contact  
will come as knowledge. Later, when you see the Tetractys in the other 
centres, you will come into contact with the angels and Archangels of 
the Four Elements.
Certainly,  this  needs  preparation,  concentration  and  meditation.  
Do not be in a hurry; you must proceed reasonably, consciously and 
in  a  safe  way.  Being  your  teacher,  I  will  watch  over  you,  and  I  will  
create  an  angelic  elemental  to  guide  you  when  you  exercise.  Always  
remember that your Heavenly Teachers observe you and help you. 
‘Joy  is  to  the  angels  and  Archangels  in  the  Heavens,’  seeing  a  
mortal being consciously proceeding towards immortality.
What we need is reason and silence. 
We  have  to  work  on  the  Middle  Path  rising  up  the  three  steps,  
which  lead  to  the  Psychical  World.  We  descend  and  ascend  on  the  
Middle  Path  to  know  our  subconsciousness  and  our  present-day  

149

personality self. When we go higher up, we enter into the Five-pointed 
Star and assume more complex work. 
Simultaneously, we descend and ascend on the Right Path, on the 
twelve steps towards the Logos, towards the Light, which gives light to 
every Human Being coming into the world. We will get to know our 
Ego-Self there.
Proceeding on the left side, to our Holy-Spiritual Nature, we will 
subconsciously  encounter  the  angels  and  Archangels,  who  already  
know us Consciously and Self Super-consciously.
If  our  fervent  wish  is  to  proceed  and  enter  the  Kingdom  of  the  
Heavens  within,  we  ought  to  concentrate  and  meditate  every  single  
day on these issues.”

The Return of the Prodigal Son – The Fifteen 
Steps Leading from Centre 10 to Centre 6
I 
would like to share with you more details concerning the return of 
Man,  the  Prodigal  Son,  to  the  Father,  in  relation  to  the  four  lower  
Centres 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Symbol of Life, as per my father’s private 
sessions.
“Panayiota  dear,  Joshua  Immanuel  the  Christ  gave  us  the  most  
valuable  parable  of  the  Prodigal  Son,  in  order  to  shed  ample  light  
on the Truth pertaining to the Descent of Man into Creation and his 
inevitable Ascent. This was the major theme of my doctoral thesis, ‘Via 
Crucis, Doloris, Pestis, Restitutionis que’ - ‘The Way of the Cross, Pain, 
Pestilence (Sorrow) and Reinstatement.’ I was always deeply inspired 
by this parable. So, thirty years ago I decided to write a one thousand 
page volume, analysing in every detail the advent of the Human Race 
on planet Earth, its deeds amid sorrow, pain and calamities, and our 
efforts throughout the centuries to gain our way back to Theosis. First, 
we are going to read this parable once more, and then we will relate it 
to the Symbol of Life in an applied manner.
‘And He said, A certain man had two sons: And the younger of 
them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth 
to me. And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after 
the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far 
country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. And when 
he  had  spent  all,  there  arose  a  mighty  famine  in  that  land;  and  he  
began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that 
country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would 
fain  have  filled  his  belly  with  the  husks  that  the  swine  did  eat:  and  
no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How 
many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and 
I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say 
unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, And 
am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired 
servants. And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a 

151
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and 
fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him, Father, I 
have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy 
to be called thy son. But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the 
best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes 
on  his  feet:  And  bring  hither  the  fatted  calf,  and  kill  it;  and  let  us  
eat, and be merry: For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he 
was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. Now his elder son 
was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard 
musick and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and asked what 
these things meant. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and 
thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe 
and sound. And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his 
father out, and intreated him. And he answering said to his father, Lo, 
these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy 
commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make 
merry with my friends: But as soon as this thy son was come, which 
hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted 
calf. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that 
I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: 
for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is 
found.’ (Luke 15:11-32).
In  this  parable  the  ‘Father’  is  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  God  the  
Father,  our  Heavenly  Father.  The  ‘Sons’  are  the  Spirit  BE-ings  in  Its  
Oneness. The ‘Portion of Goods’ is the Life-Light and the Mind Super-
substance.  The  ‘Lost  or  Prodigal  Son’  is  that  reflexion  of  our  Spirit-
Ego-Self, which is by Its own free will and God’s consent, humanised. 
The  ‘Prostitutes’  are  the  prodigalities  in  life.  The  ‘Swine’  represent  
the  base  elementals  in  our  present-day  personality  that  are  made  of  
Mind  -  the  gift  of  Absolute  BE-ingness.  The  ‘Fatted  Calf ’  which  is  
killed, is our gross material body and the ‘Ring’ symbolises eternity 
and our ability to perceive eternity. Our Heavenly Father, most loving 
and  merciful,  waits  expectantly  for  the  return  of  His  Prodigal  Sons.  
And when one of us returns Home, ‘There is joy in the presence of the 
angels of God over one sinner that repenteth’ (Luke 15:10).
Now, let us apply this Truth to the Symbol of Life.”

The Descent
‘One God came into being in time primeval’
‘He will be incarnated after coming from the world beyond the 
magnificent world of God’ (Ankh-en-Aton and Khor-Aton)
“At the beginning of the Right Column of the Symbol of Life we 
encounter  Centre  2,  which  macrocosmically  is  everywhere  wherever  
we find the concept of Space and Time. Although Space is one aspect 
of God’s Nature, time as past, present and future is a concept, a mere 
reflexion of the Eternal Present in the Worlds of Duality. The concept 
of time and space-place originates here. Centre 2 is also the Plurality 
of the Absolute BE-ingness; the Pan-Universal Logos and the Divine 
Holy Monads.
The  Divine  Monads  in  Centre  2  are  macrocosmic  in  expression.  
These  Divine  Monads  project  Eternal  Monads,  Divine  BE-ings  –  
Archangels and Men.
The  Archangels  move  from  Centre  2,  on  the  Path  2→3,  towards  
Centre  3.  Although  the  Nature  of  the  Archangelic  BE-ings  is  Logoic,  
moving  over  to  Centre  3  They  relinquish  Their  capacity  of  Self-
awareness and are clothed with Holy-Spiritual Super-consciousness. 
However,  our  Spirit  in  the  Divine  Holy-Monadic  Self  maintains  Its  
Absolute Self-aware Nature, since Human Beings retain their inherent 
capacity for Self-awareness even after incarnating.
Then,  we  descend  on  the  Logoic  Path  from  Centre  2  to  Centre  
5,  the  centre  with  the  upward  pointing  Triangle  and  the  red  Cross  
in  the  middle  –  the  Centre  of  the  Idea  of  Man,  of  Heavenly  Man  or  
of  Archangel  Man.  In  Centre  5,  the  Triangle  symbolises  our  Trinity  
as  Spirit-Soul-Personality,  and  the  red  Cross  represents  the  Four  
Elements  in  perfect  balance.  In  Centre  5  we  are  still  Spirit,  ready  to  
pass through the Idea of Man.
We  can  separate  the  Idea  of  Man  into  two  states,  Nature  and  
Expression.  The  Nature  of  the  Idea  of  Man  is  within  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness  in  the  Super-Noetic  World  and  beyond.  It  is  also  an  
eternal  attribute  of  our  Spirit;  we  have  always  had  within  us  the  
tendency  to  become  a  Human  Being.  In  reality,  the  entire  World  of  
Ideas originates from the uppermost Great Triangle of the Symbol of 
Life of the Absolute BE-ingness. Subsequently, the Idea of Man within 
us as Spirit passes through Centre 2 of the Divine Holy Monads and 

153
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
descends into Centre 5 of Heavenly Man – the Centre of the Expression 
of the Idea of Man - in order to become a Human Being. 
Then, we descend from Centre 5 to Centre 8. In Centre 8, Heavenly 
Man becomes Soul Self-awareness, a BE-ingness now ready to become 
a phenomenon of Life. The circle in Centre 5 is our eternal BE-ingness; 
the black spot in the circle is our Spirit-Self; the red line on which the 
circle rests, gives us our Divine Nature and earthly existence.
Then  from  Centre  8,  through  the  pathway  to  the  Centre  of  the  
Psychical World, Centre 9, we will be dressed with our psychical body, 
the  body  of  our  emotions.  We  will  descend  according  to  the  Divine  
Will  through  the  path  between  the  Psychical  Centre  and  the  Gross  
Material Centre 10, which is still pure and clean. We are still in the 
golden light in Centre 8, and moving further down to Centre 10, we 
will be clothed in a dense material body and incarnate on Earth.
Something  similar  takes  place  macrocosmically  on  the  opposite  
side, the side of the Archangels. They descend to create. From Centre 
7  they  help  to  build  our  psychical  body,  and  the  Psychical  World  
through  Centre  9.  Furthermore,  from  Centre  7  they  work  to  give  us  
our material body, and the material Universe in Centre 10. 
Macrocosmically, we have the centres within us. We will start our 
work  from  the  lowest  centre,  Centre  10.  What  path  are  we  going  to  
ascend? We are going to ascend all three paths to gain experience.
I,  being  your  earthly  teacher  will  help,  inspire  and  guide  you  
to  ascend  the  paths  through  the  gates  where  you  enter  and  exit  the  
different  centres.  You  will  see  and  follow  the  symbolic  numbers  of  
the various steps, especially in the Middle Column. You have to pay 
attention  because  from  the  lowest  centre,  Centre  10,  all  the  way  up  
you will see the numbers on the path, and you will work separately on 
each step. You also have to observe the colours on the paths because 
they carry their own meaning.
Now, we will deal with the Middle Path, which is a double path 
because  it  concerns  our  descent  towards  materialization  and  our  
ascent back to Theosis. Our descent is finally accomplished in Centre 
10. Through the physical union of two Souls, man and woman, a new 
Soul or personality self-awareness will enter the world of matter. The 
descent of Man is complete!”

The Ascent
 “Feel that you are in Centre 10, the lowest centre of the Symbol of 
Life. In this centre we see varying colours. If we place the Symbol of 
Life on us, looking at it from Centre 10, on the right side we will see 
the  red  colour  and  the  brown  colour.  The  red  colour  symbolises  the  
blood, and the brown colour symbolises matter. On the left side the 
violet light dominates giving energy and power.
Mesocosmically,  this  centre  symbolises  gross  matter  on  planet  
Earth  and  everything  material  co-vibrating  according  to  the  Law  of  
the  Four  Elements.  Also,  beyond  planet  Earth,  other  Planets,  Solar  
Systems, Galaxies and everything that exists in time and place in the 
Macrocosm  and  in  the  Microcosm.  For  us  Human  Beings,  it  is  the  
whole gross material body as well as the genital organs in space-place. 
However,  do  not  forget  that  although  microcosmically  in  time  and  
space-place  we  live  on  planet  Earth  as  present-day  personalities,  in  
reality it is the planet that lives in us as a Soul-Ego Self. 
In Centre 10 we observe both macrocosmically and microcosmically 
an  intense  procreative  motion-movement-vibration;  here  we  have  
all  phenomena  of  Life.  We  already  know  these  phenomena  in  the  
Material  World  in  Gross  Matter,  in  the  Liquid-Water  Element  on,  
around and inside the planet, in Air and in Fire. Air and Fire are not 
easily detectable in this centre, but exist along with a Fifth Element, 
the Ether, which constitutes the Ethereal World inside and around the 
material Earth.
Now, on the material body of a man or a woman, we find two feet 
and the genital organs. If a person stands as if wearing the Symbol of 
Life, we will see in the Middle Column for the man the penis and the 
two testicles. The penis is the vehicle for the descent of Life, which is 
purely of the Absolute BE-ingness. The left testicle is Holy-Spiritual 
and the right testicle is Logoic. At a later stage, I will further elaborate 
on  how  the  Life  currents  interchange  their  polarity  from  Logoic  to  
Holy-Spiritual.
The same counts for a woman. The womb is the seat of Life, which 
is purely of the Absolute BE-ingness. The left ovary is Holy-Spiritual 
and the right ovary is Logoic. Under the blessing of Divine Providence 
governing our gross material body, the four lower Centres (7, 8, 9 and 
10) and the corresponding organs (spleen, liver, solar plexus-abdomen 

155
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
and the genitalia) are predominantly under the supervision of the Holy 
Spirit. Man instinctively recognises them and eventually learns how 
to use them in collaboration with the Divine Will of the Holy Spirit. 
As mentioned previously, in Centre 10 in our body, we identify three 
distinct, yet cooperating organs that constitute three diverse states of 
interaction. Henceforth, we are going to name them as the Three Steps 
in Centre 10. 
Be aware, as a general rule, we will not concentrate on the different 
organs, but we will work on the Steps pertaining to the organs!
Let us now examine the Three Paths connecting Centre 10 to other 
centres  from  the  viewpoint  of  our  ascent  to  the  Father,  the  Divine  
Triangle of Centre 1. 
The  Middle  Path  of  canary-yellow  or  golden  colour  is  both  
descending and ascending. It belongs to the Absolute BE-ingness. It is 
the Path of Direct Descent of God the Father to the Material World. For 
us living in Centre 10 it is the majestic Path of Ascent of the Prodigal 
Son.
The  Logoic  Right  Path  of  canary-yellow  or  golden  light  is  also  
descending,  as  well  as  ascending.  Descending  is  the  Light  of  Christ  
Logos that gives Light to every Human Being coming into the world. 
This Logoic Light transmutes our Nature as Absolute Holy-Spiritual 
Super Consciousness and Absolute Logoic Self Super-Consciousness 
into our Human Hypostasis in the worlds of the mundane. Henceforth, 
we are able to express consciousness and self-awareness – a reflection 
now of our Nature as Spirit. However, for us living as a present-day 
personality it is a Path of Ascent. 
The  Left  Path  of  purple  light  is  the  Holy-Spiritual  descent,  and  
for us it is also a Path of Ascent. It is Jacobs’ Ladder with the twelve 
different steps that we have to slowly and prudently ascend, because 
each step is a whole world. 
Consequently,   in   the   lowest   centre   Three   Paths   of   Ascent   
commence. We have to pay attention to the pathways. When we start 
our  work,  we  must  be  in  a  positive  state  of  mind.  We  notice  that  
on  every  path  there  is  an  entrance  from  a  higher  centre  to  a  lower  
centre and vice versa. We exit the lower centre and gradually ascend 
towards the Great Uppermost Triangle of the Holy Trinity. We move 
upwards  passing  through  Centres  9  and  6.  We  ascend  in  stages  that  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
156
correspond to our psycho-noetical development. During this voyage, 
we must know that every path we encounter is either descending and/
or ascending, and constitutes a gate either to enter and/or to exit. In 
Orthodox Liturgy just before reading the Gospel the priest counsels in 
a loud voice, “The Gates, the Gates, let us attend to them in wisdom!” 
The Gates symbolise the Ten Centres of the Symbol of Life.
While  working  to  ascend  the  Middle  Column  of  the  Symbol  of  
Life, we are constantly illuminated by ample golden light all the way 
up  to  the  Absolute  BE-ingness.  Furthermore,  after  exiting  Centre  10  
of  Gross  Matter,  we  first  encounter  another  Three  Positions  or  Steps 
on the Central Column between Centre 10 and Centre 9. These Three 
additional Steps, added to those that are within Centre 10 make a total 
of Six  Steps.  In  Centre  9,  the  Centre  of  the  Crescent  Moon  and  the  
Five-pointed Star that symbolise our personality self-aware Self, we 
find another Three Steps we have to master. On the material body, this 
centre  corresponds  to  the  solar  plexus.  It  is  where  our  present-day  
personality self-aware Self lies.
So,  the  material  body  is  in  Centre  10,  but  our  present-day  
personality  self-awareness  in  this  material  body,  dwells  in  the  
centre of the etheric double called the solar plexus. In Centre 9, it is 
the  subconscious  and  the  entire  world  of  elementals,  as  well  as  our  
psychical body, which will concern our present-day personality self. 
The work on the Five-pointed Star and the Three Steps in this centre 
will be done mentally under guidance.
However,  there  is  a  strict  prerequisite:  We  only  gain  entrance  to  
Centre 9 through the mastery of the two lower converging Paths: The 
Logoic Path 10→8 on the right side and the Holy-Spiritual Path 10→7 
on the left side. Therefore the work we are about to undertake is both 
Logoic and Holy-Spiritual!
Leaving  Centre  9,  we  see  Three  Paths.  The  Central  Path  9→6 
reaches Centre 6, the Centre of the Christ Logos Sun, symbolising the 
material  heart  in  our  material  body.  On  the  line  connecting  Centre  
9  and  6,  and  Centres  8  and  7,  we  see  the  First  Cross.  The  other  two  
Paths commencing from Centre 9 are: One going to the left side (Path 
9→7), leading us to a particular Holy-Spiritual expression of Cosmic 
Fire,  and  another  one  going  to  the  right  side  (Path  9→8),  leading  us  
to  a  Logoic  expression  that  provides  us  with  the  Divine  Vehicle  of  
the  Soul.  These  two  also  represent  conditions  of  our  present-day  

157
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
personality  self-awareness,  of  our  Logoic  Self-aware  Nature  and  of  
our Holy-Spiritual Consciousness. The seat of our Subconsciousness 
is rather located on the left side.
Again, in Centre 6 we see two ascending Paths towards Centres 4 
and 5 (Paths 6→4 and 6→5), and two descending Paths towards Centres 
7 and 8 (Paths 6→7 and 6→8). 
Let  us  now  further  elucidate  some  similarities  amongst  Centres  
10, 9 and 6: Regarding the two Paths that extend from Centre 10, the 
one on the right side joins Centre 8 (Path 10→8), and the other one on 
the left side meets Centre 7 (Path 10→7). This means that we have to 
ascend from Centre 10 to Centres 8 and 7 through our material body 
and its etheric double. Similarly, we have to ascend from Centre 9 to 
Centres  8  and  7  through  our  psychical  body  and  its  etheric  double  
(Paths 9→8 and 9→7). In the same way, we have to utilise our noetic 
and noetical bodies dwelling in Centre 6 in order to descend to Centres 
8  and  7  (Paths  6→8  and  6→7).  Hence,  the  Centre  6  of  the  Soul  and  
the  Centre  7  of  the  Seven  Flames  are  approached  from  Centres  10,  9  
and  6  by  mastering  our  corresponding  bodies  and  following  certain  
pathways. 
It is from Centre 9 that we can come into direct contact with the 
Holy-Spiritual Archangelic Orders on the left side in Centre 7. On the 
other hand, our contact and ascent from Centre 9, the solar plexus, to 
our Self-aware Nature at Centre 8 on the right side, is our first Self-
conscious contact with our Ego-Self. 
So, let us try to calculate the Stages or Steps required for our spiritual 
upliftment  in  order  to  transmute  our  present-day  personality  self-
aware self into our Self-aware Permanent Personality Self-aware Self, 
our ‘I-ness.’ From Centre 10 of gross matter, to Centre 9 of the solar 
plexus, up to Centre 6 of the Heart and beyond, we encounter many 
steps:
(a) There are Three Steps within Centre 10
(b) On the Path between Centres 10 and 9 there are another Three 
Steps; 
in total Six Steps
(c) Within Centre 9 Three more Steps; in total Nine Steps
(d) Additionally, Three  more  Steps  are  up  to  the  middle  point  of  
the First Cross which is situated at the point of intersection of 
the Central Column and Path 7↔8; 
in total Twelve Steps

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
158
(e) And another Three Steps up to Centre 6 of the Heart; in total 
Fifteen Steps
Then,  from  Centre  10  up  to  the  Centre  6  of  the  Heart  there  are  
altogether 
Fifteen Steps or Initiations. The end result of this process 
is the 
Baptism of Fire, under the Christ Logos Himself. Rest assured 
that this is not the end of our return journey. From Centre 6 upwards, 
the Steps or Initiations are more difficult and demanding. We have to 
become as clean and pure as possible in order to ascend them. 
In this lesson I did not elaborate on the Three Steps within Centre 
6, neither on the Three Steps after Centre 6 leading to the Cross defined 
by the point of intersection of the Central Column and Path 4↔5 and 
beyond... 
The Baptism of Spirit has commenced...
Let  us  pause  here,  because  each  of  the  aforementioned  Fifteen 
Steps  must  be  attended  by  a  series  of  meditations.  In  our  work,  we  
will  engage  the  Holy  Mind  and  the  Divine  Art  of  Visualisation,  so  
as to be assured that the different noetical images we shall create are 
not  mere  creatures  of  our  fantasy,  but  the  sound  foundations  of  our  
endeavour.  We  need  to  be  engaged  in  the  study  of  the  symbols,  to  
understand and feel our Self in our material body and in our present-
day  personality.  Moreover,  we  will  ascend  to  Centre  6  of  the  Heart,  
which is the Centre of the Pan-Universal Christ Logos. There we see 
the Six-pointed Star with the red Cross imprinted in its centre, which 
symbolises the balancing of the Four Elements, the Crucifixion of the 
personality self-awareness and its Resurrection higher up. At first the 
Christ Logos will give us inspiration for higher deeds and the strength 
to  proceed  further,  then  gradually  aspiration  towards  His  Divine  
Attributes  of  Total  Love  and  Mercy  and  finally  He  will  lead  us  into  
becoming One with Him by assimilation and ‘At-one-ment.’ His voice 
that now sounds in our hearts is not just void words; ‘I am the Way 
and the Truth and the Life.’ We as Researchers after the Truth walk 
His Way Consciously and Self-consciously. The voice of our Beloved 
One guides us constantly:
We  have  to  work  progressively  to  become  masters  of  matter,  
masters of etheric substance, masters of psychical and noetical super-
matter  and  substance  respectively;  to  become  the  masters  of  Mind  
with  which  the  present-day  personality  is  built.  Gradually  we  will  
be able to come into contact with the Heavenly Powers. If we want to 
achieve that, we have to be able to project ourselves macrocosmically.”

TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
A Mediation on Mastering the First Three Steps
“Now, let us practice contemplation and visualisation:
The  Material  World  (Centre  10)  is  a  relatively  dark  world  if  
viewed from great height, from the aspect of Mind Super-Substance; 
yet  it  is  very  bright  for  us  who  live  in  this  Material  World.  Do  not  
underestimate this world because it is the world in which the Absolute 
BE-ingness expresses Its Plurality at the lowest level, in Gross Matter. 
And  when  Absolute  BE-ingness  expresses  this  Plurality  through  the  
Holy Spirit and the Christ Logos, It does that perfectly. If we perceive 
imperfection in this world, this comes from our inability to understand 
the Divine Plan. We are merely shortsighted, since our vantage point 
is most of the time self-centered and furthermore our current memory 
is  incomplete  and  incoherent.  So,  we  are  unable  to  correlate  events,  
circumstances, and come to correct conclusions. ‘The light of the body 
is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full 
of light: but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness’ 
(Luke 11:32). 
If we examine a shell from the bottom of the sea, we see harmony, 
beauty and perfection in the smallest form, i.e. in the microcosm. We 
see perfection in a Galaxy, in a Sun, in a Solar System, and we find it 
also in an atom. We see Divine Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total 
Love and Goodness in the Material World everywhere around us in all 
forms of Life, both mobile and immobile. All are expressions of Life. 
Macrocosmically, we see the glorious manifestation of the Absolute 
BE-ingness in Nature, as well as within us. Microcosmically through 
introspection, we also find it in our material body. When we start our 
investigation on the cells and organs in our material body, we are on 
the Three  Steps  in  Centre  10.  Therefore,  the  work  on  the  first  Three 
Steps will be in our material body. 
Notice the Path from Centre 7 to Centre 10. Centre 7 corresponds 
to the spleen in our material body. From the spleen the Holy-Spiritual 
expression of Life maintains our material body. The Centre of Fire on 
the left is the spleen. The same applies to our psychical body, giving 
us the psychical spleen. The spleen is of great importance. It is vital 
for the economy of the material body. It is the seat of Fire. From there, 
the blood is fashioned and obtains its creative qualities from the Holy 
Spirit to maintain our atoms, cells and organs. An illness of the spleen 
is responsible for all kinds of anemia. Blood is Fire!

On  the  right  side  we  have  our  Self-aware  Nature.  Centre  8  
corresponds  to  the  liver  in  the  material  body,  which  consists  of  two  
parts. Why? 
During  a  lesson,  I  mentioned  that  a  long  time  ago,  before  the  
separation  of  the  sexes,  before  beings  became  men  or  women,  Man  
was a hermaphrodite. Hence, the process of reproduction and delivery 
were  not  as  they  are  now.  At  some  stage,  a  lump  was  created  at  the  
side of the liver and continued to grow. Eventually, the being entered 
into a state of semi-hypnosis, one part of its liver was rejected and a 
new plasma would emerge; this is how a new being was born many 
aeons ago. The new plasma was fed by the electromagnetic condition 
and  the  humidity  of  the  planet,  and  so  was  independent  from  its  
father-mother  parent.  When  reproduction  occurred,  one  part  of  the  
liver dropped down to become the new being, another part of the liver 
began to regenerate from the bottom upwards. Man multiplied in this 
way at that time. This dual condition has always been in the material 
body of Man.
The material body of the Human Being with all its organs is Holy-
Spiritual. Some organs that are inactive in women are active in men, 
and vice versa. Have you ever thought why? Why God endowed man 
with something He did not give to a woman, and why God endowed 
a  woman  with  something  He  did  not  give  to  a  man?  God  planned  
it  in  this  way  to  promote  the  connection  between  men  and  women;  
their cooperation and union, through the process of the repetition of 
procreation  as  creation.  We  have  the  ultimate  honour  of  becoming  
co-creators with God.”
Guidelines on the Mastery of the Steps
“As I said, the Central Path on the Symbol of Life is both Logoic Self-
awareness and Holy-Spiritual Consciousness in expression under the 
blessing of Absolute BE-ingness, God the Father. So, under the Will-
Pleasure of the Almighty Its combined Nature and Expression descend 
as  Life-Energy;  Self-aware  Life-Energy  on  the  right  side  and  Holy-
Spiritual  Life-Energy  on  the  left  side.  Start  recognising  and  feeling  
this  Life-Energy  in  your  body  and  everywhere  in  nature.  Feel  LIFE!  
See LIFE, listen to LIFE, smell LIFE, enjoy LIFE everywhere in the vast 
space, in the Omnipresence of Absolute BE-ingness. Feel GOD as LIFE 
within you. You are LIFE and our Father in Heavens is THE LIFE. We 
are ONE. Feel the attraction of this Great Truth, and begin to wake-up...

TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
When   we   work   more   diligently   and   intentionally   on   the   
(bidirectional)  paths,  all  the  work  will  be  done  first  on  the  noetical  
level, creating noetical images, and later on the noetic level. The means 
we have to use is the Mind. Provided we purify it from the phantasies 
of our subconscious, we will obtain creative thought and use it for the 
formation of our constructive noetical images.
Acquire the habit of being observant. See and feel all the varying 
colours and hues on the different paths. These colours are Archangelic 
expressions,  a  manifestation  of  Archangelic  Life.  Try  to  attune  your  
self to these vibrations of Mind.
Of course, not all of us will meet and see the same things on these 
paths. It depends on the development of the personality of each one of 
us. Nevertheless, the principal points are the same and the symbolism 
is identical. 
Please  keep  notes  of  the  experiences  you  have  on  the  paths  and  
in  the  centres  when  you  do  the  exercises  and  meditations.  The  goal  
is  the  same  for  everyone,  but  our  individual  needs,  predispositions  
and experiences vary considerably. Everyone will feel or face different 
difficulties on the paths. Although the Way is common to all of us, the 
journey per se is individualised and unique.
The  most  important  thing  is  to  work  with  your  teacher  and  to  
unhurriedly  pass  through  the  paths  in  a  safe  and  protected  manner.  
The  Christ  Logos,  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  Guardian  Archangel,  your  
invisible  teachers  and  the  many  Archangelic  Orders  will  watch  over  
you  from  on  High;  for  according  to  the  Great  Pharaoh-Hierophant  
Akenaton (Ankh-en-Aton) and the Highest-Priest Khor-Aton, ‘You are 
safe, you are protected and guarded through Eternity.’
Gradually  you  will  come  into  contact  with  our  Brothers  the  
Archangels  and  may  even  be  able  to  converse  with  them  in  Their  
Divine  Language.  However,  not  all  of  you  will  hear  the  same  things  
because not all of you have the same needs.
I  will  give  you  a  piece  of  advice:  Each  one  of  you  must  work  
individually.  Should  you  need  help,  consult  your  Brother-guide.  In  
this  way  you  will  make  progress.  Share  your  experiences  with  your  
teacher  or  with  people  you  trust  and  love.  Be  careful  with  whom  
you  share  these  teachings  I  am  giving  you.  If  someone  is  thirsty  to  
know  and  work,  then  help.  But  these  lessons  are  not  for  chattering  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
162
The Return of the Prodigal Son
and  small  talk.  Do  not  confess  your  experiences  without  exercising  
due  discrimination,  especially  with  people  who  do  not  share  your  
spiritual path, because they will not understand you, and you might 
also confuse and harm them instead of helping them.
Do not give solid food to babies; you might kill them. You have to 
give milk to babies and solid food to adults. This is my advice to you.”

The Great Triangle of Centres 7, 8 and 10
“O
N the lower part of the Symbol of Life, we see the big inverted 
triangle  formed  by  Centres  7,  8  and  10.  The  two  downward  
paths on either side represent our feet, and on the lowest point, Centre 
10, we have the genital organs of both man and woman, the seat of the 
Holy Spirit in creation. Centre 10 is both Holy-Spiritual and Logoic. 
The one who descends from the right side to become a living Soul, 
a present-day personality self-awareness, will express his Logoic Self-
aware existence. Simultaneously, angels and Archangels cooperate to 
create his material body consisting of atoms, cells and organs. They 
not  only  create  it,  but  sustain  it,  and  make  it  grow.  Comprehend  
the  great  Holy-Spiritual  role  in  the  material  body,  in  what  is  called  
catabolism and anabolism. These two apparently diverse procedures 
are the indispensable components of metabolism, the holy instrument 
of pure balance in our body.
The Holy Spirit works in the material body to transform it into 
a  temple  of  God.  The  first  inhabitant  in  this  temple  is  the  Christ  
Logos,  our  Self-aware  existence,  the  light-giving  Light  to  every  
Human  Being  coming  into  the  world.  The  next  inhabitant  is  our  
Holy-Spiritual existence, which is conscious Life in a form; the seat 
of subconsciousness and later Super-consciousness.
On the right fiery side of Centre 10, we notice the expression of the 
Christ Logos Himself. The Archangel Michael is in charge here; He is 
the authority. In reality Centre 10 is not circular but spherical.
We can see that from the right inner side of Centre 10, our Self-
aware existence is in contact with the sky-blue light of the Archangel 
Gabriel (Kha-Vir-El).
Enter  the  Centre  of  the  Four-sided  Pyramid.  In  this  pyramid  we  
have both Logoic and Holy-Spiritual work. Here, we find everything. 
We are in the Centre of the Pyramid as material existence and as gods, 
Children of the Almighty.
Turn to the left side and see the electromagnetic violet light. The 
pure  kingdom  of  the  Holy  Spirit  lies  there.  The  Archangel  Raphael  
is in charge, He is the authority. We can see that from the left inner

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
164
side of Centre 10, our Holy-Spiritual existence is in contact with the 
sky-blue  light  of  Archangel  Gabriel,  who  plays  a  double  role.  It  is  
the Archangel Gabriel, who is in charge of our incarnations, since He 
offered the Virgin Mary the Six-pointed Star, a lily for the incarnation 
of the Christ Logos Himself.
Furthermore, we also have Him on the left side of the Symbol of 
Life as our protecting Archangel, apart from our Guardian Archangel. 
Jacob’s Ladder with the twelve steps and the Archangelic descent is on 
the Left Path.
I will mention again the five positions, which are:
1. On the right side, the Path downwards (8→10)
2. The Fire element of Michael in Centre 10 on the right side
3. The Centre of the Four-sided Pyramid
4. The  Electromagnetic  element  of  Raphael  in  Centre  10  on  the  
left
5. The upward and downward Archangelic Path on the left side 
(7→10)
These  five  positions  will  lead  us  through  the  three  steps  of  the  
Central  Column  to  Centre  9,  the  Five-pointed  Star  and  centre  of  the  
solar plexus.
The departure point of the present-day personality self-aware self 
through its etheric double is the lowest point, Centre 10. From there it 
will develop and express itself in Centre 9 above.
In  Centre  9  there  are  five  outward  rays-triangles.  By  uniting  the  
base  of  these  triangles  with  five  lines,  an  inner  pentagon  is  formed  
within  the  Five-pointed  Star.  Rays  from  the  centre  of  the  pentagon  
travel to its five apices, shaping five more inward triangles.
According to one of the parables of Christ, they symbolise the five 
wise and the five unwise virgins. The five wise virgins had enough oil 
in  their  lamps,  meaning  they  had  adequate  quantities  of  the  Super-
substance of Mind. On the contrary, the five unwise virgins were short 
of oil in their lamps.
A great deal of work must be done by us as a present-day personality 
in Centre 9, in the Five-pointed Star. 

165
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
Now, returning again to Centre 10 we see the Four-sided Pyramid 
with the five apices, the four triangles of the pyramid and two other 
triangles, one pointing upwards and one pointing downwards (please 
consult the two unpublished paintings by Daskalos on pages 111 and 
112).
I  have  mentioned  that  we  come  from  the  right  side,  the  Right  
Path.  See  it  separated  into  two.  Our  descent  is  a  pure  Conscious  
and  Self-aware  Logoic  expression.  During  this  holy  procedure,  we  
are  accompanied  by  our  Guardian  Archangel  and  the  Christ  Logos  
Himself. However, we have to work to ascend the twelve steps from 
Centre 10 towards Centre 8. We must commit ourself to a lot of work 
on the right ascending path, so as to ascend the twelve steps to the top.
Our very wise ancestors gave twelve degrees of initiations to the 
so-called  semi-God  Heracles.  The  Twelve  Labours  of  Heracles  are  
nothing  else  but  degrees  of  initiation  and  levels  of  perfection  of  the  
present-day personality self.
You must occupy yourself daily with completing your exercises, 
without missing even one. You must wear your Archangelic Garment 
or  Form  before  entering  the  fiery  side  of  the  pyramid.  You  will  
encounter  the  twelve  steps  on  the  right  inner  path.  At  their  highest  
point, they come into contact with the sky-blue light of Gabriel.

The  Archangel  Gabriel,  the  sweet  and  compassionate  Archangel  
of  Mercy,  is  in  charge  and  presents  Himself  in  each  labour  we  do.  
However,  we  will  not  always  have  Him  by  our  side.  There  will  be  
times when we will have the law and control of Archangel Michael, 
the fiery condition. When we ascend to the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth 
Labour, we will see that we come into contact with Fire and enter into 
it. We will have more control, but the ascending process will be more 
difficult.  We  realise  that  Archangel  Gabriel  withdraws,  and  that  the  
purifying work of Archangel Michael becomes more intense.
When  we  look  at  the  Symbol  of  Life,  we  must  not  think  that  
it  is  simply  a  symbol.  It  is  our  Life,  our  initiations  and  levels  of  
Consciousness  and  Self-awareness  between  Centre  10,  the  lowest  
centre, and the Upper Centres on the Middle Path or Column.
On  the  first  step  of  the  Middle  Path,  Heracles  killed  two  snakes  
when  he  was  still  a  baby.  These  two  snakes  symbolise  the  two  
electromagnetic currents, which are located at the lower angle of the 
Great  Inverted  Triangle  (Centres  7-8-10).  In  our  material  body,  they  
ascend through our feet.
The two currents ascending upwards to the left and right through 
the spinal column, alternately interchange their routes to give us the 
Caduceus of Hermes; another symbol we find in Centre 10.
We have to become an earthly Hermes (Master), a Hermes in the 
Psychical World and a Hermes in the Noetical World, to finally obtain 
the  degree  of  Hermes  Trismegistus.  This  is  why  he  is  called  Three-
times Great.
Our Inner Self as god-Hermes, confronts the labours as triumphs 
in the three centres: In Centre 10, in Centre 9, which is the solar plexus 
with the Five-pointed Star, and in Centre 6, which is the Six-pointed 
Star in the Noetical World. Yet, the real triumph to become Hermes, 
the Three-times Great, will take place in Centre 6. 
This will happen when we unite the Higher Noetical World with 
the  Lower  Noetical  one.  When  we  ultimately  unite  the  downward  
pointing triangle with the upward pointing triangle of the Six-pointed 
Star, and balance the Four Elements, symbolised by the Cross in the 
middle of Centre 6.
But if we pass as Soul Self-awareness through the Fiery Path from 
Centre 6 to Centre 5, will we not also find the triangle, which symbolises 

167
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
the Deity, and the Cross in the middle – the symbol of the balance of 
the Four Elements? We must find the common points between Centres 
6 and 5 and discover our Permanent Personality and Soul-Self. A lot 
of work must be done to ascend higher.
You may wonder if all Human Beings will finally ascend. Is the 
one who descended not going to ascend again? Joshua Immanuel the 
Christ  gives  the  answer,  ‘And  no  man  hath  ascended  up  to  heaven,  
but he that came down from heaven’ (John 3:13). Our Inner Self will 
definitely ascend!”

Man in Creation – Preparing to Ascend
Path 10→8 of the Twelve Labours
“T
HE  Symbol  of  Life  we  meditate  and  work  on,  symbolically  
represents the Macrocosm, the Mesocosm and the Microcosm. 
We should be aware that we need to work extensively on the Symbol 
of Life. But how are we going to continue with this engaging activity? 
We have to keep doing it in the right way!
Absolute  BE-ness  is  Eternal  Life.  We  are  aware  of  two  major  
characteristics  of  the  Nature  of  Absolute  BE-ingness:  Divine  Self-
Sufficiency and Will-Pleasure. These two States are equal and no one 
is inferior to the other. The one is contained within the other, and they 
are inseparable. When Absolute BE-ingness vibrates Its Divine Will-
Pleasure to manifest Itself in Itself in a specific space-place within the 
Absolute Space, the Idea of Mind becomes the tool of Creation. From 
that moment on, Mind in all stages of expression comes forth.
We should know that Mind is neither the Christ Logos nor the Holy 
Spirit. Mind is the means through which the Absolute BE-ingness, as 
the Christ Logos in Its Absolute Logoic expression, conveys Itself as 
the Pan-Universal Logos. And Mind is also the means through which 
the Absolute BE-ingness, dynamically now as Holy Spirit, will express 
Its Divine Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total Love and Goodness.
Pay  attention  now.  The  Holy  Spirit  will  express  Divine  Total  
Wisdom, Total Power and Total Love and Goodness through the Mind. 
The  Christ  Logos,  the  Pan-Universal  Logos,  will  express  the  
Absolute BE-ingness in Its Divine Total Wisdom, Total Power and Total 
Love and Goodness, but now Total Goodness assumes another form, 
the Logoic expression. The Pan-Universal Logos now utilises the Total 
Wisdom of Mind to be expressed as Total Love and Total Goodness. 
He  who  is  the  Light  that  gives  light  to  every  Human  Being  coming  
into the world, passes the eternal Divine BE-ings (His projections as 
well as radiations of the Holy Monads) through His Light, in order to 
present themselves as Logoic existences.

169
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
The  other  kingdoms,  both  animal  and  vegetable,  are  expressed  
through  the  Holy  Spirit.  The  Holy  Spirit  does  not  give  Absolute  
Self-aware  Nature,  but  Absolute  Conscious  Nature.  All  the  animals  
and plants express this Absolute Conscious Nature as instinct, while 
Heavenly  Man,  the  Archangel  Man,  is  the  Absolute  Archangelic  
Eternal Soul Self-awareness.
The  animals  and  plants  are  not  Souls.  They  only  have  Divine  
Breath.  The  Soul  is  the  Spirit.  The  Spirit  passes  through  the  Idea  of  
Man,  and  then  becomes  a  living  Soul.  All  the  other  kingdoms  are  
expressions of the Archangels through Their angels. The angels are the 
elementals of the Archangels, but they do not have Self-aware Nature.
Each and every Man is an Archangel. He passes through Heavenly 
Man, the Idea of Man, the Archangel Man. Eternally, he is the one who 
descends from Heaven, and he is the one who will inherit Eternity.
Christ said, ‘He who descended from Heaven will ascend, and return 
to  his  Divine  Nature.’  We  see  it  in  the  parable  of  the  Prodigal  Son.  
We  know  that  even  with  the  imperfections  of  our  personality  self,  
we  are  similar  to  the  Macrocosm.  Therefore,  we  need  to  discern  the  
emanation of our Eternal Self, which is the image and likeness of God. 
This Eternal Self will teach our present-day personality self.
We  recognise  this  personality  self,  this  time  and  place  self.  It  is  
our  material  body,  our  psychical  body,  the  body  of  our  wishes  and  
desires, and our noetical body, the body of our thoughts. We should 
aim to make these three bodies cooperate and co-exist harmoniously, 
so that they no longer serve our personality self, but the Inner Self or 
our Soul Self-aware Self. Because, as we know, these bodies make up 
our personality self. As personality self-awareness we are the material 
body, the psychical body and the noetical body. Are these three bodies 
with  their  etheric  doubles,  the  connecting  links  and  the  means  of  
expression of these bodies, our Self? No, they certainly are not!
Mind is the means of our expression. Mind itself is the means of 
expression of the Holy Spirit and the Christ Logos, as well. 
Our  personality  self  is  the  connection  and  synthesis  of  all  the  
vibrations  of  Mind  in  time  and  place  through  which  we  express  
ourself. But pay attention, what self? Our real Self!

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
170
The total unity of Mind which we call the material body, is made 
up of gross matter. What we call the psychical body is made of super-
matter.  What  we  call  the  noetical  body  is  made  of  substance  and  
the noetic part of ourself is made of Super-Substance, in a formless 
condition of Mind.
All  these  bodies  consist  of  Mind.  Think  upon  this:  Do  they  not  
dispose a kind of existence beyond our own existence? Of course they 
do, because Mind contains within it Life in all the expressions of Life. 
Do not ever think that Mind is devoid of Total Wisdom, Total Power 
and Total Love and Goodness. 
For this reason, we are responsible when we give form to noetical 
images.  We  enslave  Total  Wisdom,  Total  Power  and  Total  Love  and  
Goodness in an elemental, which now expresses Mind as cleverness, 
as  the  human  expression  of  love,  or  as  other  conditions  like  hatred,  
which  are  erratic  expressions  of  Goodness.  Mind  used  in  all  these  
ways requires a lot of energy.
When  we  consciously  create  noetical  images-elementals  and  
observe  them  constantly,  we  will  realise  that  they  have  a  lot  of  
intelligence,  but  not  intellect,  in  them.  They  bear  the  intelligence  of  
their creator and they act according to the purpose of their creation. 
Since  they  do  not  possess  self-awareness  they  are  unable  to  express  
intellect,  the  capacity  for  conscious  knowledge.  Do  not  forget  that  
elementals   have   a   psychical   component   that   contains   psychical   
super-matter  and  a  noetical  component  bearing  noetical  substance.  
Nevertheless, the mystic can endow his angelic elementals with higher 
forms of Mind. Elementals may potentially contain all forms of Mind!
Remember in a lesson I had mentioned that from a mere atom or 
Sun  to  a  perfectly  formed  cell  or  Galaxy,  everything  contains  Total  
Wisdom,  Total  Power,  Total  Love  and  Goodness,  and  the  individual  
Circle of Possibility and Probabilities that governs each phenomenon 
of Life and Man. Regarding the Human Being, all the above are not 
related  to  our  intelligence  or  intellect,  but  are  included  within  the  
Mind manifesting in our bodies.
We are Divine BE-ings in the Absolute BE-ingness, projections of 
Divine Holy Monads. On the other hand, Mind is Super-Substance in 
the Noetic Worlds, the Worlds of Ideas-Laws and Causes; and exists, 
we can say, as Divine Substance in a lower degree of vibration. Through 
this vibration, Ideas acquire form and exist. Which form do they get 

171
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
indeed?  It  is  not  yet  a  solid  form.  At  a  lower  degree  of  vibration  we  
will find psychical super-matter, which is again substance, and which 
contributes towards the expression of elementals. Our psychical body 
derives from the Permanent Psychical Atom of Heavenly Man and it 
can therefore embrace such mundane existences as the elementals.
The elementals, the noetical and psychical images that Man creates, 
do  not  take  on  gross  matter.  The  Absolute  BE-ingness  has  deprived  
Man of the authority of creative ether because Man abused it in past 
ages. Consequently, Man may think creatively but his elementals are 
not allowed to directly acquire material form.
The  Archangelic  Orders  on  the  other  hand  have  not  lost  this  
authority, since they never misuse the Mind. They give form and life 
to the Ideas they project and materialise. We can observe the results 
in the Material, Psychical and Noetical Worlds. All of us dwell within 
Archangelic  creations.  Nothing  exists  that  is  not  an  Archangelic  
expression. All forms of Life in every kingdom (mineral, plant, animal 
etc.), from the smallest to the biggest, derive from the Divine World 
of  Ideas,  Laws,  Principles  and  Causes  and  assume  a  material  form  
through the work of the Holy Archangels.
Can  we  understand  now  what  Form  is?  It  is  an  materialised  
projection  of  an  Idea.  Only  the  blind  in  mind  cannot  see  God,  the  
Absolute BE-ingness, in the Universes.
With all our might, we need to endeavour to search and find this 
Total  Wisdom  and  Total  Power.  Upon  finding  it,  we  should  express  
Total  Love  as  Love  to  our  fellow  Human  Beings,  and  also  to  the  
Universes, to His Creation. We have to express this Love everywhere. 
You  may  be  wondering  how?  By  giving  form  to  Mind  Super-
Substance!  What  else  are  the  phenomena  of  Life  around  us,  but  
materialised Mind?
First, we have to undertake the serious task of studying the Ideas, 
the  forms  and  the  materialization  of  forms  as  noetical  images.  This  
is  because  the  sum  total  of  our  present-day  personality  self-aware  
self,  is  none  other  than  these  noetical  images,  which  constitute  our  
conscious and subconscious self. 
Closely  examine  what  psycho-noetical  images  comprise  your  
subconscious! Then, draw them up and see what needs to be dissolved. 
While  you  study  them,  live  knowing  and  understanding  that  we  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
172
co-exist with our lower self. Observe and know yourself more through 
the three mirrors of gross, psychical and noetical matter, and come to 
realise how much you abuse this pure Divine Substance. Purify your 
personality self and proceed to see your beautiful, bright Self, which 
is not enchanted by anything. 
We know that the life of Man in the Material World, is all about 
finding  out  what  he  really  is  as  a  present-day  personality.  Not  what  
he  thinks  he  is,  but  he  is  not.  Man  must  learn  how  to  purify  Mind  
and make good use of it as matter, super-matter and substance. There 
is  no  imperative  need  for  Man  to  know  Mind  as  Super-Substance  
because once he ascends through the heights of ecstasy, he will be in 
the presence of his Real Self. In this state, he will know who and what 
he truly is. 
Now,  our  whole  task  on  the  Symbol  of  Life  is  to  give  form  to  
the proper noetical images, and to penetrate and enter reality through 
them on the different centres. Do not think of this as trivial work. Do 
not regard this Symbol you see in front of you as a mere captivating 
symbol  on  a  surface,  for  it  is  Life  itself!  It  is  the  different  levels  of  
Life,  the  different  schools  of  Life,  through  which  you  will  become  
acquainted with your Real Self. You will come to know how to contact 
the  Archangelic  Orders  and  Higher  BE-ings  through  the  Paths  and  
Centres.
Most  people  do  not  know  yet  how  to  be  in  proper  contact  with  
other  Human  Beings  who  live  near  them  or  with  whom  they  meet.  
They are not able to communicate even on talking terms. So, one must 
be naive to think that people will automatically be able to contact the 
Super-Intelligences, the Archangels. 
Our first obligation is to get in touch with our fellow-men through 
right thinking, feeling and talking. Then, we will hear His voice saying, 
‘Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over 
a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter into the 
joy of thy Lord’ (Matthew 25:21).
The ‘Joy of our Lord’ is the knowledge of reality, the knowledge 
of the Truth, which will free us from time and place ignorance, from 
feelings of dissatisfaction with life. It will give us the knowledge that 
each one of us is a Child of the Highest, a Child of Spirit and Light.

Now, look again at the lowest centre, Centre 10. It is separated into 
three parts. In the middle equidistant part, is the square with its two 
intersecting diagonals. Its base represents the Law of Tetractys. 
Bear in mind that this is merely a two-dimensional depiction of 
the square and its diagonals. If we examine them three-dimensionally, 
we  see  the  two  diagonals  forming  four  upward  pointing  triangles,  
which  meet  at  a  point  at  the  centre  of  the  square,  that  now  gives  us  
a Four-sided Pyramid. On the right side, is the kingdom of Michael 
(Ma-Kha-El) in red colour. Farther out to the right, outside the right 
triangle of the red light in expression, is the Primary Fire. On the left 
side, is the kingdom of Raphael (Ra-Pha-El) in violet colour. Farther 
out to the left, outside the left triangle of the violet light, is the Primary 
Holy-Spiritual Fire.
For the time being, we have to work in the Four-sided Pyramid. We 
will pass through the Fire on the right side, which is Mind-knowledge, 
and reach the first step of the Logoic Ladder, which is separated into 
twelve  steps.  We  already  know  what  this  ladder  is.  It  is  the  Twelve  
Labours  of  the  semi-God  Heracles.  If  we  do  not  endeavour  to  work  
through all the above, we will not be able to proceed any further.
We  are  familiar  with  the  first  step,  the  First  Labour.  We  have  to  
symbolically  kill  the  Nemean  Lion,  meaning  rage  and  anger.  When  
we kill the lion, we have to remove its skin, clean it well and wear it 
as a vestment. There are people living in ignorance or darkness, and 
they  will  try  to  take  advantage  of  us,  taking  our  gentle  kindness  as  
weakness.  When  we  wear  the  clean  lion  skin,  it  will  represent  the  
dignity of our Self-aware Self. Then, even as a present-day personality, 
we will know how to react properly in each case.
How  will  we  be  able  to  kill  the  lion?  The  whole  work  on  the  
labour  needs  to  be  carried  out  noetically.  By  entering  into  the  real  
meaning of things, we have to start with a healthy autosuggestion. I 
explained before what suggestion and autosuggestion is, so I will go 
on to present how exactly we will use Total Wisdom, Total Power and 
the Total Love of Mind, and work with it. I have mentioned again that 
Mind  as  matter,  as  super-matter,  as  substance  and  Super-Substance  
contains  Total  Wisdom,  Total  Power  and  Total  Love.  We  find  it  in  
every atom and cell; anywhere we look, we will see Mind as Form – 
Divine  Thought  in  manifestation,  something  that  is  not  done  by  us.  
When we are able to do that, we will materialise Mind.

Previously, I mentioned that you need to write on a white piece of 
paper in red ink, ‘I will not be angry with any person for any reason.’ 
There  is  no  excuse  for  anger.  Others  may  be  unjust  with  you.  They  
may slap you. Turn the other cheek, as well. There may be a reason for 
this behavior, but there is no excuse for you to be angry. You will not 
achieve anything by being angry. Anger and rage are not power, but 
weakness. To keep calm and peaceful is power. 
If you want to make things easier for you at the beginning, create 
an elemental of yourself and give it a solemn order to interfere every 
time you are about to be angry. You will see the elemental of yourself 
appear  like  your  personality  self.  After  all,  is  your  time  and  place  
self, which is upset this moment, different from that elemental? You 
already know that the total of all elementals you create compose your 
personality self. Therefore, this elemental will now be under your own 
will and intention. 
Archangels  and  angels  are  watching  over  us,  and  if  we  request  
help, they will give it to us. Our Church urges us to ask for help from 
our  Divine  Father  and  our  Guardian  Archangel  who  is  the  guardian  
and  protector  of  our  Souls  and  bodies.  Even  the  Church  asks  us  to  
come into conscious contact with the Archangelic Orders.”

More on the First Three Labours of Heracles
“T
HE First  Labour  is  the  killing  of  the  Nemean  Lion,  which  
symbolises  anger.  This  is  the  first  beast  that  appears  in  the  
present-day  personality  self.  It  starts  to  manifest  at  the  moment  the  
newborn baby perceives the world around him.
We  see  a  baby  getting  angry  and  starting  to  shout  and  cry.  This  
is  a  primary  expression,  which  is  created  from  a  need  or  from  a  
subconscious  wish.  If  we  study  the  behaviour  of  ten  babies,  we  see  
in these babies anger at varying levels. We then realise that each one 
of us carries different experiences from previous lives, the essence of 
which form what we call our ‘character’ and affect the expression of the 
present-day personality on both a conscious and a subconscious level. 
Pay  attention,  ‘character’  is  not  a  psychical  condition.  Many  people  
may mistakenly consider it a psychical condition, but it is not. 
In this labour, we see Eurystheus who symbolises a Logoic aspect 
of  the  Will-Pleasure  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness,  in  expression  on  
Earth as the Lord of Separateness. He asked Heracles to kill the lion 
and to perform all Twelve Labours. In so doing, Eurystheus’ intention 
and  role  on  Earth  was  to  ‘kill’  Heracles,  but  by  also  being  a  Logoic  
agent and a close relative of the hero, he inevitably wants us to become 
what  we  already  are:  joint  heirs  with  the  Absolute  BE-ingness,  the  
Logos  and  the  Holy  Spirit.  Heracles  had  to  reach  Theosis.  He  was  
destined to return home as the Prodigal Son of the parable, and become 
a semi-God.
Heracles had to kill the lion, that is anger-wrath, through his will 
and reason. Do not think Heracles achieved his purpose just by giving 
the  lion  a  blow  on  the  head  with  his  club.  A  lot  of  work,  very  hard  
work is needed to annihilate the lion-anger.
After killing the lion, Heracles meticulously cleaned its skin and 
wore it, but he did not become the lion. He simply had to wear the skin. 
We have to wear the lion skin because we are living in the Material 
World.  Unfortunately,  in  this  world  people  interpret  kindness  as  
weakness, and may try to take advantage of us thinking that we are 
weak. This is the use of the lion skin in a corrective or defensive context.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
176
Never become angry! However, when you see people around trying 
to take advantage of you, or harm you or others, you will know how to 
defend yourself and the others, if need be, by energising the lion skin 
but not the lion!
The  Godman  Joshua  Immanuel  the  Christ  gave  us  an  example  
when he took up the whip in the temple to put things in order. What 
were the last words He said when He was on the cross? ‘Father forgive 
them,  they  do  not  know  what  they  are  doing.’  Yet  Christ,  the  God  
of  Love,  took  up  the  whip  and  threw  out  those  who  tried  to  make  
business  premises  outside  His  Father’s  home.  This  is  what  wearing  
the lion’s pelt means; the ability to use certain fiery vibrations to make 
a point or to defend someone if necessary but without feeling anger 
or resentment.
You cannot allow anyone to take advantage of the temple of God, 
which is your noetical body, the body of your thoughts; your psychical 
body, the body of your emotions; or your material body. If you have 
to take the whip to put things in order, you have to do it in the spirit 
of love, and you must be convinced of the rightness of your behaviour 
and actions. 
But, remember what you promised to yourself, ‘I will never become 
angry with any person for any reason, but if it is necessary to raise my 
voice to put things in order, I will do so in the spirit of love without 
losing the peace of my heart.’ 
The Second Labour is the slaying of the Hydra of Lerna.
The  hydra  lived  in  the  marsh  of  Lerna,  which  was  considered  a  
gateway to the Underworld. Water symbolises the so-called psychical 
element, not the Soul. It is what we call the psychical body, the body 
of wishes and desires. The swamp contains stale and filthy water and 
thus it represents this part of our subconscious that encompasses evil 
elementals.  The  Hydra  of  Lerna  is  an  exact  representation  of  desire.  
We cut off one head of the hydra, and spontaneously two other heads 
appear in its place. We satisfy, fight, or try to annihilate a desire, and 
two other more intense and more demanding ones will take its place.
Heracles  had  to  find  another  way  to  accomplish  his  labour.  But  
then, in this labour, he was not alone. This time, he had his friend and 
nephew Iolaos (Iolaus) with him, his Guardian Archangel, who in the 
myth represents the Law of Reason. Indeed, as Iolaos is a close relative 

177
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
of the hero, similarly our beloved Guardian Archangel is our closest 
relative, companion and friend in our descent into the Cosmos.
When Heracles cut one head off, Iolaos gave him fire to burn the 
site of the wound. The Archangel gave him a fiery substance and the 
super-substance of Mind to use as right thinking and reason.
A desire can be destroyed or rather de-energised through the Mind. 
Consequently, if we want to annihilate a desire, we must do it through 
reason and will.
You may think that by killing the Hydra of Lerna you will not have 
desires  anymore.  You  will,  but  now  your  desires  will  pass  through  
reason, they will not be uncontrolled. You will no longer create spirits 
dumb  and  deaf,  as  Christ  said.  No  more  desire-thought  elementals,  
but instead thought-desire elementals.
All our desires, which arise out of need, must succumb to our right 
thinking. According to mythology, while Heracles was cutting off the 
heads of the hydra, a big crab wanted to defend the hydra, attacking 
and biting the feet of Heracles and Iolaos, and wounding them. The 
crab  symbolises  our  personal  egoism.  The  crab  must  be  killed  first.  
Heracles did this before he continued his work. 
We must annihilate the egoism of our present-day personality self 
to make it easier for us to continue and finish the work. I do not follow 
the sequence of the labours as it is given in the books of mythology. I 
give them to you in a way that offers coherence in our work.
The Third  Labour  we  should  pay  attention  to,  concerns  the  
Stymphalian  Birds.  Again  in  this  labour,  we  find  a  pond,  which  
symbolises the Psychical World, the world of emotions. And what are 
the Stymphalian Birds? They are exactly the elementals Man creates, 
those  that  Christ  called  dumb  and  deaf  spirits.  The  cunning  spirit  
coming out of man passes through waterless places. When it returns, 
it brings seven other more cunning spirits with it. ‘When the unclean 
spirit  is  gone  out  of  a  man,  he  walketh  through  dry  places,  seeking  
rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return into my house from 
whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, 
and  garnished.  Then  goeth  he,  and  taketh  with  himself  seven  other  
spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and 
the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also 
unto this wicked generation’ (Matthew 12:43-45).

178
While  flying,  these  frightful  elementals,  the  Stymphalian  Birds,  
let  their  wings  fall  like  arrows  in  order  to  kill  or  wound  people.  
How  many  other  such  things  happen  through  these  elementals  in  
the  form  of  thoughts,  words,  aggressiveness  and  other  such  similar  
behaviour  of  men?  In  what  way  did  Heracles  kill  the  Stymphalian  
Birds? Again, he had his friend with him. The personality self always 
has  the  Ego  within  to  help,  just  as  in  the  previous  labour.  Heracles  
carefully  checked  the  place  to  see  from  where  the  birds  emerged.  
Iolaos struck the cymbals. The terrible noise made the birds fly and 
lose their orientation. Then, Heracles was able to kill them one by one.
To  be  successful  in  this  Third  Labour,  we  must  work  through  
introspection so as to discern the nature of our elementals. We must 
find out what they can do to us, how much they can harm us or others 
around us and how to protect ourselves and the others from them. We 
know  that  we  are  responsible  when  we  create  elementals  that  harm  
others.  We  are  extremely  responsible  when  we  make  bad  use  of  the  
divine gift of Mind and shape it into terrible destructive elementals. 
We  must  learn  to  use  Mind  through  reason  and  visualisation,  and  
create  constructive  elementals.  We  cannot  call  these  elementals  
BE-ings  because  they  do  not  have  Eternal  Life.  But  they  exist,  they  
have their own life, and they hold us responsible!
Study deeply:
Have I succeeded in annihilating my lion-anger?
Have I understood what the Hydra of Lerna is? 
Have I perceived and succeeded in annihilating an elemental of mine 
that has returned?”

Work on the Nemean Lion and the Hydra of Lerna
“Close  your  eyes  and  mentally  see  that  you  are  in  the  middle  of  
the Four-sided Pyramid, in Centre 10. Take deep breaths and see the 
Logoic golden triangle in front of you.
Now, turn to the right side and see the triangle with the red light. 
On  the  surface  and  around  the  outside  of  this  triangle  we  meet  the  
fiery kingdom of Archangel Michael, the Lord of Fire. Breathe deeply 
and take a few steps until your head touches the inner surface of the 
triangle. Then further proceed until it enters the red light just outside 
the right triangle. In addition, take a few more steps until your chest 
and heart enter the red light outside of the triangle. 
Now,  take  two  more  steps  and  you  are  completely  outside  the  
triangle  and  in  the  space  between  the  inner  surface  of  the  sphere  
at  Centre  10  and  the  pyramid.  Another  step  and  you  are  in  front  of  
the  first  step  of  the  ladder  on  your  right  side,  where  the  Labours  of  
Heracles are (Path 10→8).
The first step of the ladder is of golden light. It is the path of trials 
and initiations. When you proceed on the first step, you will see a big 
stoa or hall.
The  next  step  will  lead  you  to  another  stoa.  As  you  enter,  with  
every step you take, you will encounter a new stoa and novel scenery. 
Thus, gradually you will work on all Twelve Labours. 
When you are in the first stoa, you will mentally see a forest or a 
desert. Symbolically talking, the Lion of Nemea is there. You represent 
Heracles.  You  have  to  kill  the  lion,  that  is  the  anger-wrath  in  your  
personality self. But how can you do it? In this case you do not need 
help from anyone. You will deal with the lion alone.
However,  you  have  to  pay  attention  before  putting  your  hands  
on the lion. There will be many instances when the lion will scratch 
and bite you, and make you bleed. How many times did you not feel 
wounded and exhausted after a fit of anger? Even if you thought that 
you would win the battle. 
The result of anger is not victory, but the temporary satisfaction of 
an insatiable personal egoism.
Hence,  the  Nemean  Lion  symbolises  anger,  but  its  life,  its  
expression  is  your  own  egoism.  This  is  why  you  have  to  totally  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
180
annihilate  the  egoism  of  your  personality  self.  You  would  do  well  
to  commence  here.  By  suffocating  the  lion,  you  will  simultaneously  
suffocate your personal egoism. 
Work in the First Stoa
You  have  to  sit  comfortably  in  front  of  your  desk,  having  your  
notebook and a pen. Write in bright 
red ink.
Here,  we  require  the  power  of  autosuggestion.  Then,  you  shall  
continue with the power of habit and repetition. Write down, 
‘I will 
not be angry with any person for any reason.’
 You have to write it 
down every day for several days, let us say for the next twelve days. 
This serious work should be undertaken in plain daylight and at the 
same  time  for  every  consecutive  day.  On  the  last  day  after  you  have  
finished, take deep breaths and burn the paper.
You know that what you write down and see is instantly deeply 
imprinted  in  your  subconscious.  
‘I  will  never  be  angry  with  any  
person for any reason.’
Do  not  expect  that  you  will  succeed  in  doing  it  from  the  very  
beginning.  Your  personal  egoism  will  revolt  and  present  itself  in  
many cunning ways. You have to keep calm because at this time the 
one  who  struggles  desperately  for  survival  is  not  your  present-day  
personality, but its petty egoism. The personality is merely a garment 
of your real Soul-Ego Self, and this Self does not participate actively 
in  this  struggle,  but  is  a  loving  observer  and  guide  on  your  way  to  
immortality. 
One  day,  you  will  come  to  know  your  Ego-Self  with  capital  
letters,  but  you  also  have  to  respect  your  ego-self  with  small  letters,  
your present-day personality, because it is one of the expressions of 
your  Self-aware  Nature.  It  is  that  part  of  you,  which  is  perishable  
and  will  be  dressed  with  incorruptibility.  It  is  the  mortal  part  that  
will  be  dressed  with  immortality.  ‘For  this  corruptible  must  put  on  
incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality’ (First Epistle of 
Paul to the Corinthians 15:53).
Apostle  Paul  also  stresses  that  ‘I  die  daily’  (First  Epistle  to  the  
Corinthians 15:31). Is it not your material body that dies every day, by 
continuously  changing?  However  the  material  body  is  not  our  ego-
self in small or capital letters.

181
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
We  have  to  realise  that  the  ego-self  of  the  personality  in  small  
letters is not the personality, whilst the Ego-Self of the Soul in capital 
letters is not just the Soul, but our Spirit-Soul-Ego Self.
If  the  material  body  is  destroyed  and  the  Ego  can  no  longer  be  
expressed through it, the Ego will withdraw from the material body 
intact. Nothing will happen to the Ego, this Self of ours, in small or 
capital letters. The Ego reflected through our material body as a form 
of Self-awareness is Eternal. It cannot be burned, drowned, wounded, 
or destroyed.
When you advance in your exercises and concentrate on the Ego, 
and you are free of the idea that the Ego is your material body, you will 
understand the greatness of our Self-aware Nature and existence. Our 
Self-aware Nature is the Ego with capital letters; the Soul-Self.
However, our self-aware existence, the ego in small letters, which is 
within the Ego in capital letters, is not independent or uncontrollable. 
This petty ego, our time and place expression, appears to be mortal. In 
fact it is immortal by nature, but appears mortal. It is incorruptible, 
but appears perishable. 
The  reactions  of  our  material  body  are  reflected  on  the  ego  with  
small letters, and influence it. When you proceed with the Labours of 
Heracles, you will know more of your real Ego-Self.
Now, you may wonder how your ego-self in small letters can enter 
into the Ego with capital letters, and feel to be it?
When we are in the petty ego and we proceed towards our ascent, 
its  periphery  becomes  constantly  enlarged;  we  mould  it  until  it  
expands so as to become the boundless EGO. Thus the ego-self enters 
into the EGO-SELF by assimilation! 
Alternatively, we may apply the symbol of the line to understand 
this process. The one endpoint of this line is the ego-self with small 
letters that is confined in time and place. The other endpoint represents 
our majestic EGO-SELF. Nevertheless, both ends partake of the same 
line  and  hence  they  are  always  in  unity.  The  ego-self  is  constantly  
attracted to the other end of the line by the EGO-SELF. In so ‘moving,’ 
the mundane ego-self will eventually become one with the EGO-SELF. 
We are not referring to movement in time and place as we know it, but 
to  a  developmental  process  through  successive  trials  and  initiations  
that lead to assimilation.

182
Work in the Second Stoa
Then, we proceed to the second step in the second stoa of the path 
on the right side. Mentally we will see a dark, greenish, foul smelling 
pond.  There  are  many  parasites,  and  also  the  Hydra  of  Lerna  in  it.  
This time we will not be alone. We have a friend and companion with 
us,  our  beloved  Guardian  Archangel.  Heracles  symbolically  had  his  
friend and nephew Iolaos.
We will again enter our solar plexus, which at this very moment 
is the centre of all our wishes and desires. 
If you check carefully you will see that most of your desires and 
wishes are unreasonable. You know that. You see it in our society, and 
in all the people around you. Observe! You will see very little use of the 
Super-Substance we call the Mind, and thus many violent vibrations 
coming from man’s lower unreasonable desires and emotions.
We have to kill the multi-headed Hydra of Lerna, the symbol of 
our unbridled desires. We will see however that by killing one desire 
or one head of the monster, two others will be born in its place, worse 
than the one before; demanding more. Killing means either to satisfy 
a desire or to fight it.
How can we win? Heracles had his friend to help him. While he 
was cutting off one head of the hydra, his friend Iolaos set the adjacent 
forest on fire and handed the hero a torch.
Fire symbolises Mind as thought and reason. If we try to fight our 
desires  without  weakening  their  power  through  reasonable  thought,  
without  knowing  their  nature  and  how  to  annihilate  them,  two  or  
more  unreasonable  desires  will  be  born.  As  a  result,  we  have  to  use  
both Mind-Fire and our Will in order to succeed.
When  we  finish  cutting  off  all  the  heads  of  the  hydra,  thus  
annihilating  our  desires,  we  will  see  that  in  the  place  of  the  foul  
smelling pond we now have a pond with pure, clean water.
You will realise that what is given to you from the Father of Light, 
is a divine gift. You will not feel the need to obtain or to possess; you 
will not feel that something is missing.
You will then remember what the beloved Christ said, ‘Seek ye the 
Kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you’ (Luke 
12:31).

Initiations in the Creation of the Cosmos
You now know the right way to receive from the Father what you 
are entitled to receive. Believe me, you are entitled to much more than 
you ever dreamed of having through your unreasonable desires. If you 
enslave your Self to your desires, if you are intoxicated by matter, you 
will not be able to obtain anything truly good and enjoy it.
You have to work very hard on the first two labours, in the first 
two stoas, on the ascending Path 10→8 on the right side of the Symbol 
of Life. Gradually you have to proceed to the other labours, but in a 
parallel way. Simultaneously, you have to ascend through the Stoas of 
the  Central  Column,  which  is  your  Self-aware  existence.  Then,  you  
will slowly move up to your Self-aware Nature by passing through the 
centre of the solar plexus, which is the Five-pointed Star of Centre 9. 
From there your ascent will continue. 
You have to do a lot of work on the Symbol of Life, not only for a 
few months or years or one lifetime, but maybe for centuries. The fact 
that you show interest in this work means that you have worked on it 
before and now you want to continue.
You have my blessings.”

Work on the Ascending Path 10→8
“L
ET us reexamine Centre 10. There are so many things one can 
say about this centre, which symbolises gross matter, the planets 
as matter with their etheric doubles, as well our material body with its 
own etheric double.
Three Paths are connected to Centre 10: the Middle Path, the Path 
on the Right side and the Path on the Left side. The Middle Path leading 
upwards, is our own existence. It is our present-day personality self-
aware self, but mainly it is our Inner Self, our Permanent Personality 
Self. We find this Self, ascending the Path. Going higher, we find our 
Ego-Soul  Self-awareness  and  moving  up  higher,  we  encounter  Our  
EGO  with  three  capital  letters,  our  Spirit-Self,  Heavenly  Man,  who  
descended from Heaven and will ascend again. As we know, ‘Flesh and 
blood will not inherit the Kingdom of the Heavens in you.’ By saying 
‘you,’ I am not referring to your material body, but to the ‘You’ within 
yourself. 
You have already been occupied with performing exercises in the 
square of Centre 10, the Tetractys in the Four-sided Pyramid, and you 
are currently working on three of the four triangles that compose the 
pyramid. You will do more exercises in the holy triangles, when you 
continue  work  on  the  Right  Logoic  Path  of  the  Labours  of  Heracles,  
which is separated into twelve steps. Your work here is to purify your 
present-day personality self-aware self. 
You will also work on the Left Path 10→7, the Holy-Spiritual Path, 
Jacob’s  Ladder,  which  also  consists  of  twelve  steps  and  symbolises  
the Archangelic Orders in action. The Archangels descend and ascend 
this  ladder.  Be  aware  that  when  you  ascend  the  Left  Holy-Spiritual  
Path, you have to be dressed in your Archangelic Form, the garment of 
your Hypostasis as an Archangel, and not as a common Human Being, 
so as to be recognized, accepted and be treated as equal amongst the 
Archangels.
Ascending  the  Right  Path  10→8  must  be  done  with  your  Logoic  
existence,  again  as  an  Archangel,  but  now  you  ascend  more  as  an

(c) The triangle on the right side is of red, blood-like light
(d) The triangle on the left side is of violet light
(e) The triangle behind you is of pure white light
Mentally,  see  yourself  dressed  in  your  Archangelic  Garment.  It  
will  be  done  automatically,  since  you  are  familiar  with  it.  Envision  
and feel yourself in this Archangelic Form.
Now,  turn  to  the  right  side,  take  a  deep  breath  and  commence  
walking. Observe your head first entering the red light of the triangle. 
Look. In the etheric part of your head, there is a flame. Your head is 
in  this  flame.  Continue  moving  forward  and  see  your  chest  entering  
the red light of the triangle. Now, you see a flame in the etheric part 
of your heart.
See  the  two  flames,  the  one  in  your  head  and  the  other  in  your  
heart. Slowly unite them into one big flame. Your head and chest are 
in this big flame.
Your abdominal area is touching the right triangle. No need to see 
a flame in your abdomen. See a sky-blue light, and in the middle of 
the solar plexus a small red light.
Now,  take  a  conscious  breath  and  continue  first  with  your  right  
foot and then with your left foot, stepping out of the triangle. Leave 
the  flaming  triangle  of  the  pyramid  behind,  and  stay  in  the  flame  
outside the triangle.
You feel that this flame is not burning, but is of a cleansing and 
purifying nature. Simultaneously, feel and see all your bodies in this 
flame. 
‘He who makes his angels spirits, and those who serve him flames of 
fire,’ keeps and preserves their form, the form of their material body.

See the flame cleanse your existence... Now, see yourself in bodily 
form in your white Archangelic Garment. Should you see that any stain 
remains on your white robe, you have to gradually clean it using the 
flame. The flame rising above your head must be upright and bright.
Now,  put  your  right  foot  on  the  first  step,  which  represents  the  
First Labour,  that  of  killing  the  Nemean  Lion-anger.  You  do  it  as  a  
present-day personality self-awareness, yet as a personality you know 
that  you  bear  the  Ego-Self  within.  Then,  you  realise  that  you  as  a  
present-day personality must complete this labour, not your Ego-Self. 
Your Ego-Self and your Guardian Archangel accompany you while 
you  are  facing  the  labour,  but  They  do  not  interfere.  Many  people  
think the Guardian Archangel is their twin soul. This is a big mistake. 
The  Guardian  Archangel  is  not  a  Soul.  He  did  not  pass  through  the  
Idea of Man to become the Son of Man, but to accompany us. He is not 
a Soul, but a Spirit-Archangel, and He is the Centre of the Kingdom 
of the Heavens within us. He is equal to us, but He mainly descends 
through the Middle Path. 
You should know that your Guardian Archangel will not help you 
in the First Labour. The First Labour concerns your personality, so it is 
only you that has to accomplish it. You alone must kill the lion-anger, 
and everything that causes wrath in your personality self. Killing the 
lion, you annihilate the egoism of your personality self. 
What  I  am  about  to  say  is  of  the  utmost  importance.  Our  
personality’s egoism is no demon or temptation. Egoism derives from 
the  Law  of  Opposites.  It  is  needed  when  the  Archangels  create  our  
material  body,  which  is  different  from  all  other  material  bodies  of  
the animal or plant kingdom. It is the Law of Separateness, which in 
animals is expressed as instinct and as a feeling of self-preservation.
Egoism is born at the time of our descent as an Ego-Self to become 
‘Man,’  to  become  a  Human  Being,  at  the  time  of  our  incarnation.  
We  as  a  personality  must  tame  it.  When  we  annihilate  the  egoism  
of our personality, the dignity of our Inner Self will rise and appear 
in its place. It is the halo of glory. It will only be revealed when our 
personality Self has won over our petty self.
It is necessary to kill the lion-anger and to carefully clean its skin 
and wear it. But pay attention! By wearing the lion skin, we will not 
become the lion. Its skin will only enable us to put things more easily 
in order.

187
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
Imagine what would happen if we did not wear the lion skin in 
this world of chaos and confusion; this jungle and hell we find ourself 
in  today!  Therefore,  we  need  it  to  put  things  in  order,  but  not  with  
anger.  Do  not  be  afraid  to  raise  your  voice  if  it  is  necessary,  but  do  
not allow anyone or anything to disturb your inner peace. You have 
to work on that every day. I repeat, that you have to write on a white 
piece of paper in 
red ink the following words, ‘I will not be angry 
with any person for any reason.’
Some, and even you, may wonder what service this will do to your 
personality self. You may forget that we have that form of Mind called 
subconsciousness, which resides in our etheric double. This form of 
Mind  absorbs  suggestions,  and  when  they  come  from  us,  they  are  
called  autosuggestions.  In  this  way  we  create  an  elemental,  and  our  
wish makes this psycho-noetical image, this elemental, help us as a 
personality self to win. It is created consciously, so it is not a ‘dumb 
and deaf ’ elemental. 
This work needs to be carried out consciously. Every time you read 
the  sentence  you  yourself  wrote  on  the  paper,  you  will  enter  deeper  
into  its  meaning,  and  in  the  end  it  will  become  a  part  of  yourself.  
That  means  you  will  gradually  strengthen  this  noetical  image,  this  
conscious  elemental,  and  when  it  enters  your  subconsciousness,  it  
will start its work.
You  may  wonder,  ‘If  I  do  this  work  for  fifteen  days,  then  repeat  
it  and  repeat  it,  will  I  create  an  elemental  every  time?’  Yes,  but  see  
what happens. The first elemental you have created will absorb all the 
other elementals of its kind, and in this way it will be strengthened. 
Hence, in reality you have one elemental, which you have to mentally 
strengthen  every  day.  When  you  read  the  note  you  wrote,  you  will  
have this elemental as an ally. What is written on your notebook will 
have a strong meaning for you. What is written with strong meaning 
has power, more power than spoken words.
Do that for the next few days. Then, take a new piece of paper and 
continue to write. This time, however, you have to change something. 
Your  suggestion  will  be  more  intense.  Previously  you  mentioned,  
‘I 
will not be angry with any person for any reason.’
 Now, you must 
say, 
‘I will never be angry with any person, for any reason, because 
anger  and  rage  do  not  serve  me  or  others  in  any  way.’
  You  add  
reason to what you say. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
188
And  now  I  shall  ask  you,  ‘When  do  anger  or  rage,  that  are  
troublesome, serve you, or change the reason why you became angry 
in the first place?’ Anger leaves us exhausted, weak, but never gives us 
any benefit. On the contrary, reason can serve us very well. Therefore, 
when  you  write  on  your  note  that  you  will  never  be  angry  with  any  
person for any reason, you have to realise what you are saying.
Now,  from  the  first  step  we  go  to  the  second  step.  The  Second  
Labour is the annihilation of the Hydra of Lerna. We know that the 
hydra symbolises our time and place desires and wishes, in connection 
with our egoism.
After  completing  the  First  Labour  and  killing  the  lion-anger  as  
egoism,  another  form  of  egoism  appears  as  necessity-desire,  in  the  
Second Labour. This kind of egoism believes that we will submit to it 
and consequently, succumb to our desires. The hydra has numerous 
heads, such as our plentiful and ever in need desires.
Heracles,   the   ego-personality,   needs   help   from   the   Noetical   
World.  Standing  close  by  him  is  Iolaos,  our  Guardian  Archangel,  
accompanying  the  ego-personality  from  the  time  of  its  very  first  
descent.
I  need  to  repeat  that  the  Guardian  Archangel  was,  is  and  will  
always remain Spirit. He did pass through the Idea of Man in order to 
be ‘Egofied’ and to escort us into Creation, but He has never dressed 
himself with the Idea of Heavenly Man. Nevertheless, He has the right 
to temporarily assume the Human Form, without having to be dressed 
with gross matter. When angels and Archangels appear to men, don’t 
they obtain the Human Form? Hence, the Form is one thing and the 
incarnated personality self-awareness another.
When  Heracles  cut  one  of  the  hydra’s  heads  off,  two  others  
appeared. Is it not like that with desires? If we fulfill or combat desires, 
that is if we cut off one of the hydra’s heads without using reason, two 
other heads or desires will appear in its place.
However our Guardian Archangel, or in the myth Iolaos, comes to 
the rescue with a torch in his hands. The torch here symbolises reason. 
We can only vanquish this beast with right thinking, so we have to cut 
off the hydra’s head-desire, and immediately burn the area using the 
torch of reason given to us by our Guardian Archangel - Iolaos. 

189
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
According to the myth, when Heracles, the ego-personality, tries 
to  kill  the  hydra,  a  big  crab  appears  and  begins  to  bite  his  feet.  Not  
only does he bite Heracles, but Iolaos as well! The crab symbolises our 
attacking egoism, that refuses to accept defeat. Hence, we as Heracles 
must first kill our crab-egoism.
When the crab bit Heracles, it wounded his feet, meaning his time 
and  place  expression,  but  the  crab  also  bit  the  Guardian  Archangel,  
Iolaos. You may wonder how this is possible. You should remember 
that even though the Guardian Archangel does not incarnate or become 
humanised together with Heracles, the ego-personality, He is attuned 
to  the  personality  self-awareness.  The  Ego-Self  and  the  Guardian  
Archangel  are  fully  and  totally  attuned  (‘Egofied’).  Therefore,  the  
Guardian Archangel receives and accepts the wounds of the personality 
self-awareness.
To  what  degree  the  Guardian  Archangel  feels  pain  or  suffers,  is  
another matter. But Heracles, the Ego-Self, does feel pain and surely 
does suffer. It is permitted that the Guardian Archangel, Iolaos, allows 
to  be  ‘wounded’  so  he  may  perceive  what  is  happening  in  time  and  
space-place.
With  the  help  of  our  Archangel,  we  will  eventually  kill  the  
seemingly invincible hydra. I am telling you that the Second Labour 
is one of the most difficult labours. It is much more demanding than 
killing the lion-anger through suggestion and autosuggestion, because 
we consider desires to be part of ourself, even though desires are not 
ourself.
Anger and rage can exhaust us, can wound and expose us. When 
did  a  Human  Being  after  a  fit  of  anger  not  really  regret  it  later?  No  
man can consider anger a part of himself, but he certainly considers 
his desires as such. ‘I want this, I want that, I wish to have this; I wish 
to have that...’
Henceforth, we cannot kill the hydra unless we cut off one of its 
heads and burn the area with the fire of reason.
In the same way you worked to complete your First Labour, you 
will now proceed with the second one.
Take  a  piece  of  paper  and  write  the  various  intense  desires  you  
have. Not your necessities of life, but desires that trouble you.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
190
Study them carefully and gradually annihilate them, but not the 
purpose for which they were created. Pay attention to this detail, the 
annihilation  of  the  intense  vibrations  of  craving  for  something.  An  
answer  will  come  from  your  personality-self.  Most  of  the  time  an  
instinctive  response  will  emerge  out  of  the  present-day  personality,  
‘But I cannot have it,’ or ‘is it possible to have it?’ This is the reaction.
Write your desires on the one half of the piece of paper, and on the 
other half weigh them. ‘Is it possible to fulfill these desires? Are they 
reasonable? Are they necessary?’ You have to pass the desires through 
reason.
Yes, you have to kill the hydra, but you will not kill the needs and 
the necessities of life. 
The  ulterior  purpose  of  all  reasonable  desires  is  for  them  to  be  
materialised. Therefore, we have to pay attention and weigh things in 
order to ensure that the desire we send as an elemental, which will not 
be fulfilled at that moment, does not become a stumbling stone on our 
way in the future.
Remember that we have to allow time for our reasonable desires 
to be fulfilled.”
For  us  Human  Beings,  this  symbol  depicts  the  perfect  union,  assimilation  
or ‘marriage’ of the Permanent Personality Self-aware Self (the Six-pointed 
Star)  with  the  present-day  personality  self  (the  Five-pointed  Star)  in  the  
Logoic Centre 6 – the Heart Centre. Then, our Self in full attunement with 
the Christ Logos Consciousness shines as a Logoic Sun of Love.

191
The Temple within Us – Mythology – Sa-Ta-AL
“A
DVANCED  mystics  of  the  past  who  searched  for  the  Truth,  
studied almost all systems of Life, by using images, pictures and 
symbols.  They  observed  the  Powers  that  govern  the  Universes  and  
realised that the symbols corresponding to these Divine Attributes are 
always the same.
The  symbol  of  the  Microcosm  is  the  Sphere,  and  our  etheric  
double also resembles a sphere. Thus, when we work on the aura of 
our  etheric  double,  we  simultaneously  work  on  the  aura  of  planet  
Earth, and higher up through attunement. 
Although it is possible for us to come into conscious contact with 
the  Archangels,  however  at  the  moment,  most  people  are  in  contact  
with them subconsciously. The Archangels know us and are eager to 
help us. They have known us even before our descent. 
Now, mentally see the lowest centre of the Symbol of Life, Centre 
10, as a sphere. In the sphere notice the Four-sided Pyramid with its 
big  square  floor.  This  is  our  first  symbol  from  the  bottom  up.  Now,  
from here we will proceed further, but we are not supposed to dissolve 
the  pyramid.  Remember  that  each  triangular  side  of  the  pyramid  is  
power and energy, both from the inside and the outside.
Through visualisation, we will build the temple of our Inner Self 
in  order  to  enter  into  conscious  contact  with  higher  levels,  higher  
conditions.  What  you  will  slowly  build  with  my  help  and  the  help  
of other Masters, who have never lived on Earth, is already active for 
centuries on the etheric double of our planet.
Mystics  from  Egypt,  Greece  and  other  civilizations  have  built  
the  temple  you  are  about  to  construct  thousands  of  centuries  ago;  
and  what  has  been  built  by  Mind  is  never  lost.  A  material  building  
can  be  destroyed  and  the  colossal  material  pyramids  of  Egypt  will  
be  demolished  one  day;  whatever  is  made  of  gross  matter  will  be  
dissolved. ‘Not one stone will be left on another,’ Christ said. But, these 
visualisations cannot be dissolved for all eternity because they have 
been built on fundamental Truths, and are sustained by these Truths.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
192
A  Seeker  of  the  Truth  will  see  these  visualisations  slightly  
differently.  He  will  colour  them  and  see  them  according  to  his  
temperament.  But,  these  temples  are  eternal  because  they  are  in  the  
Kingdom of the Heavens within us, whether we know it or not.
Hence,  when  we  start  to  visualise  and  work,  we  will  not  enter  
unknown  territory  or  conditions.  We  will  be  surprised  to  see  that  
the moment we start building our temple by using the Mind, we are 
actually  rebuilding  what  already  exists.  Others  are  helping  us,  and  
we shall come to realise that our abilities in intuition are constantly 
expanding.
This  is  not  enough,  however.  Later,  we  need  to  work  in  a  more  
systematic  and  focused  way.  We  must  perform  exosomatosis  not  in  
‘place’,  on  planet  Earth,  but  in  ‘conditions.’  This  is  the  real  way  to  
enter the Kingdom of the Heavens, which is within us.
What we shall gain is our ‘property,’ it is of pure substance, that 
‘Neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break 
through or steal’ (Matthew 6:20), as Christ taught. This property comes 
from Heaven, not from Earth. However, these Great Truths can also be 
found on Earth.
We must now start to build this temple in the Four-sided Pyramid. 
Observe the floor. Progressively enlarge the base of the pyramid and 
separate it into forty-nine squares. Half are white, and the other half 
are  black.  There  are  seven  squares  on  each  side,  in  total  forty-nine.  
What we now see, is the shadow of the forty-nine sub-planes of the 
Psychical and Noetical World. So, keep in mind that these forty-nine 
squares are not reality, but the shadow of reality.
You  are  now  standing  in  the  middle  of  the  floor.  One  foot  rests  
on a white square, and the other foot on a black square. The triangle 
in front of you resembles a high wall, made of golden light. It slowly 
opens. You find yourself facing the east, and you notice three closed 
doors in front of you. They look like they are made of alabaster. The 
middle door is bigger than the other two. 
Do  you  think  that  the  pattern  of  the  three  adjacent  doors  in  all  
Orthodox  temples  leading  to  the  altar  was  made  by  accident?  Of  
course not; the Holy Fathers of the past knew the secret of the central 
entry, and how to get into the Holy of Holies.

193
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
I repeat:
(a) In front of you lie the three doors and the wall with the golden 
light shining like a sun.
(b) On the right door there is an icon of the Archangel Michael, 
and on the left door there is an icon of the 
Archangel Gabriel. 
This is not by chance either.
(c) From the inner surface of the middle door, you see and feel the 
radiation of the Logos Himself.
(d) From  the  inner  surface  of  the  right  door  of  the  Archangel 
Michael, 
you see and feel His radiation of red light and His 
Logoic expression.
(e) From the inner surface of the left door of the Archangel Gabriel, 
you see and feel His radiation of sky-blue light.
(f ) On  the  right  side  of  the  Archangel  Michael  there  is  a  wall  
with His characteristic red light. On this wall a huge window 
appears to be seen.
(g) On the left side of the Archangel Gabriel there is also a wall 
with  His  soothing  sky-blue  light.  A  huge  window  is  also  on  
this  wall.  But  caution  now!  The  sky-blue  light  that  belongs  
to  the  kingdom  of  the  
Archangel  Gabriel  is  on  the  inner 
surface of the wall. On the outside of the wall there is a violet 
light, which is the radiation of the 
Archangel Raphael.
(h) So,  we  see  three  Archangels.  Two  of  them,  Michael  and  
Gabriel, are very close to each other. The third one, Raphael, 
who is on the left side, is outside the wall.
What you now see so far, you will later encounter more intensely 
through these windows, when you eventually travel with greater ease 
through the right and left doors to the corresponding planes and sub-
planes. I will help you do so. Your contribution to this holy work is to 
maintain your strength and the power to do it.
Behind  us  is  another  wall;  it  has  no  window.  The  lower  half  of  
the wall is dark and represents gross matter, whereas the upper part is 
white and represents the Higher Realms of Spirit.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
194
Behind us, closer than the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, there 
stands  another  Archangel.  Apart  from  our  Guardian  Archangel,  He  
has descended with us, accompanies us, is ever standing near us, and 
will  stay  with  us  until  our  return  to  Theosis.  He  accompanies  us  to  
the  entrances  and  exits  in  all  our  incarnations.  In  the  old  Egyptian  
language  of  the  Hierophants  He  is  called  
Sa-Ta-AL. Sa  means  
Truth, Ta  stands  for  giving  abundantly  or  expressing  and  AL  is  the  
Absolute  BE-ingness  in  Its  Will-Pleasure  to  manifest  Itself  in  Itself.  
Consequently, Sa-Ta-AL means the ample expression of the Almighty 
as Truth.
Where  do  we  find  this  Archangel?  In  the  area  of  the  lower  parts  
of  the  feet,  up  to  the  knees  and  thighs.  He  slips  into  the  body,  but  
sticks out from the pelvis and projects behind us like another person, 
regardless  of  whether  we  are  a  woman  or  a  man.  He  is  taller  than  
us,  resembling  a  boy.  An  adolescent  with  black  hair  and  wide  black  
eyes.  His  hands  are  always  touching  our  shoulders.  He  regulates  
our inhaling and exhaling. He is an Archangel of Matter, but also of 
Heaven. He is the first to contact us after we are born.
The floor under the dark squares relates to the Eleusinian mysteries 
in Greece and to the Twelfth Labour of Heracles. I have talked to you 
before about these. However, in our current work, there is no need to 
go  deeply  into  these  great  initiations  pertaining  to  the  Underworld  
and our reincarnation. Here, we will find another symbol. We will see 
Mother  Earth,  the  Goddess  Demeter,  according  to  Greek  mythology.  
We  will  see  her  as  a  robust  woman  holding  a  bunch  of  wheat,  the  
symbol of fertility, in her hands; sometimes she is crying and at other 
times she is happy. All who contact Earth in this way encounter the 
same symbol. They see Mother Earth, the mother of our present-day 
personality self, which is represented by her daughter Persephone. 
Once again we encounter the power of names. In Greek, Demeter-
Δήμητρα is a compound word. De or Ge-Γῆ is the Earth, whereas Meter-
Μήτηρ is the Mother; hence Mother Earth. However, the etymology 
of the name Persephone is indeed shocking: The first constituent word 
Perse  derives  from  the  ancient  Greek  verb  Pertho-Πέρθω,  that  is  I  
conquer by siege. The second one, Phone, comes from Phonos-Φόνος, 
meaning murder. So, Persephone is the present-day personality that 
potentially  harbours  calamity,  destruction  and  all  sorts  of  violence  
by fighting others, and in turn by being attacked. But her name also 

195
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
signifies  that  she  is  the  one  who  is  eventually  destined  to  be  the  
slayer of the monster of egoism residing in our subconsciousness, the 
Underworld. Yes, Persephone will honour her name by annihilating 
her petty self, who is the origin of every malice. 
The brother of Goddess Demeter, Pluto or Pa-Al-Aton, the God of 
the  Underworld,  Persephone’s  uncle,  kidnapped  her  and  forced  her  
to stay with him in the Underworld half of the year. The other half, 
she was to be with her mother. Zeus, the Father of all Gods and Men, 
could not intervene because Persephone committed herself by eating 
seven gem-like seeds (arils) of the pomegranate that Pluto deceitfully 
offered her. 
The Pomegranate is a very powerful symbol, which had been used 
in  ancient  Egypt  and  in  the  Eleusinian  Mysteries  in  ancient  Greece.  
As a unit it is an exact representation of the Multiplicity of Absolute 
BE-ingness in Centre 2. Its red arils with the central seed symbolise the 
Holy Monads. By eating the arils, Persephone irrevocably consented 
to descent into the words of the mundane in order to be incarnated - 
there was no way to undo her decision. Number 7 refers to the Seven 
Bodies or Vehicles of Man. Furthermore, it is the Holy Number that 
harbours Numbers 3 and 4 – the manifestation of the Holy Trinity in 
conjunction with the Law of Tetractys.
This  myth  also  describes  the  descending  of  the  present-day  
personality self-aware Self into other kingdoms beyond gross matter, 
and the return to her mother (the Soul), which means the reincarnation 
of the present-day personality self-aware Self.
When we penetrate the floor of the Four-sided Pyramid, we will 
know  the  whole  Truth,  even  that  concerning  the  Underworld.  Then,  
we  will  compare  it  with  what  Christ  said,  ‘Verily,  verily,  I  say  unto  
you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth 
alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit’ (John 12:24).
Thus, Persephone, meaning the present-day personality self-aware 
Self, is always accompanied by Sa-Ta-AL. From the time of descent for 
incarnation,  for  each  one  of  us,  no  matter  the  gender  we  incarnate  
in, one Archangel from the Order of Sa-Ta-AL will be with us. As we 
have  an  Archangel  Michael,  Raphael,  Gabriel  and  Uriel  working  in  
our  material  body  as  warmth,  creativeness  and  balance,  so  we  have  
one Archangel from the Order of Sa-Ta-AL. By consistently doing our 
work in this temple, in our material body, we will experience all these 
Truths.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
196
We have to see this temple symbolically, as I described it to you, 
with the three doors, the two windows and behind them the condition, 
which will be our entrance into another state before incarnating.
What are we going to meet entering this condition? Let us employ 
Greek mythology. It says that we will see power devoid of reason, which 
we  will  meet  in  the  three  worlds,  the  Material  World,  the  Psychical  
World and the Lower Noetical World. We will see this power as a dog 
with three heads. This dog is called Cerberus or Ke-Pe-Ra. In the old 
Egyptian language Ke-Per means to become or to create, and Ra is the 
name of the Sun-God in matter. Hence, Cerberus is the keeper of our 
entrance into gross matter. He is not hostile as you may think when 
you first meet him. He simply does not permit reincarnation until the 
exact  and  proper  time  of  the  next  incarnation  has  been  determined.  
Pay attention to this detail.
We  will  also  meet  Pluto  or  Pa-Al-Aton.  We  can  consider  him  a  
father, a protector of matter, of the material body. In the myth, he is 
the one who builds the material body of the present-day personality 
self in each incarnation with Persephone, his wife and niece. 
We  will  get  to  know  all  this  in  a  more  practical  way  when  we  
study  the  Laws-Powers  more  profoundly;  Powers  that  have  Noetic  
Total Wisdom, Total Power, and Total Love and Goodness in them. 
I  have  talked  to  you  about  the  creative  work  of  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness  as  Holy  Spirit.  As  Christians  we  have  to  see  everything  
from  different  angles.  You  have  to  see  what  exists,  has  existed,  and  
will exist in the etheric atmosphere of the Earth. Through meditation 
you can see all this, but it is better to know what great mystics have 
built  through  visualisation  on  the  symbols.  They  have  forged  the  
Great Truths into Holy Symbols.
You  may  think,  ‘But  do  we  have  the  right  to  add  more  details  
around the symbols?’ Yes, we do. We have the right to add more, but 
not  the  right  to  remove  anything,  because  these  Great  Truths  are  no  
longer just symbols; they have become reality.
A mystic can mentally add more to enhance beauty and emotion. 
For example, he can place in the temple seven lamps to be lit, when 
the time has come to light the Central Column.
You are aware of how to light a lamp. You visualise it as a beautiful 
white candle or golden candle. You can even see it in another colour, or 
you may see it in the form of a lamp. Then, you see reality in your way. 

197
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
You see that the one lamp must become seven, as John the Evangelist 
described in ‘The Apocalypse.’
You will then enter deeper into the meaning of the parable of the 
five wise and five unwise virgins and their lamps. You will gradually 
recognise  all  these  symbolic  truths  as  noetical  living  images,  as  
powers. Yet, you will not deify these images. Many in the past, made 
the mistake to adore Pa-Al-Aton or Adonis, as he was called in the past 
in  Cyprus.  We  are  Christians  and  believe  in  One  God,  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness, and bow in reverence before His multiple manifestations.”
That  moment  I  mentally  said,  “Please  Father,  tell  me  more.”  He  
smiled and continued. 
“In Cyprus, Adonis has replaced Amon-Ra. Amon-Ra is nothing 
else but an expression of Michael. As Aton, he symbolises the Noetic 
Sun, and mythology says that he was the son of Apollo. His mother 
was Queen Smyrna (or Myrrha), daughter of Kinyras. Kinyras was the 
King of Cyprus, but actually he had the higher rank of a Hierophant. 
In Cyprus, King-Hierophants ruled for many generations. The same 
applied  in  Crete,  where  King  Minos  was  also  a  High  Hierophant.
Smyrna  became  pregnant  from  Apollo  (with  Adonis).  Kinyras,  
who symbolises brutish power (something corresponding to the God 
Ares  or  Mars)  wanted  to  kill  her.  He  chased  her,  and  the  moment  
he  was  ready  to  kill  her,  Apollo  transformed  her  into  a  tree,  a  very  
sweet  scented  tree  called  Smyrna  (the  myrrh  tree).  In  nine  months,  
the Goddess of childbirth, Eileithyia (Εἰλείθυια in Greek), came down 
from Olympus and helped Smyrna give birth to her son. They found 
the god-boy Adonis near the root of the tree.
Goddess Aphrodite fell in love with Adonis and took him as her 
lover.  Later  on,  I  will  explain  to  you  the  symbolic  meaning  of  these  
myths. Aton or Adonis is greatly connected with Sa-Ta-AL, who is our 
protector and who dearly loves us. 
When  you  want  to  come  into  contact  with  him,  it  is  enough  to  
close your eyes and place your hands on your thighs (the palms facing 
down), as you see it done in the statues in Egypt. Take deep breaths 
and  wish  to  make  contact  with  him.  You  will  see  a  very  handsome  
boy with black eyes, black hair, and wide shoulders. Sa-Ta-AL wants 
to know you better. You will perceive him as an Entity because he is a 
part of you. But once more, I need to clarify that this Archangel is not 
your Guardian Archangel.

Exercise  visualisation  and  meditate,  so  that  you  can  enter  the  
temple, which is in you. It will become a reality for you, and with my 
help you will enter through the central gate, through Fire. 
When you open the middle door of this temple, you will see huge 
flames, and each one of you will see reality in the subconscious part of 
yourself. You will know yourself and hence proceed.
Be careful to whom you are giving what I say to you, lest it becomes 
food for the dogs. ‘Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither 
cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, 
and turn again and rend you’ (Matthew 7:6).
People must be initiated into this work so as not to misinterpret 
it in irreverence.”

Meditation on the Four-sided Pyramid
in the Sphere of Centre 10
“W
E are once more on the Symbol of Life. On the human body, 
Centre 10 represents the centre of the genitals, while on the 
Symbol of Life it also represents the whole human material body.
When  we  look  at  the  Symbol  of  Life,  we  see  a  two-dimensional  
surface, but when we start to work and to meditate, we comprehend 
things very differently. 
Centre  10  symbolises  gross  matter:  the  galaxies,  the  planets  and  
whatever  consists  of  gross  matter.  We  have  to  see  Centre  10  three-
dimensionally, which means we have to perceive it as a Sphere.
In  your  meditations,  you  will  conceive  of  it  as  a  huge  Sphere  in  
which  you  will  do  all  your  exercises.  You  know  the  colours  in  the  
Sphere; they correspond to the colours outside the Sphere. On the left 
side you observe the violet colour-light, whereas on the right side the 
red colour-light.
Then, you see the inner surface of the Sphere. Do not perceive the 
colours of the surface as if it is painted; rather see the surface of the 
Sphere in the respective colour-light. On the right side you have pure 
red light, and on the left side pure violet light.
In  front  you  see  canary-yellow  or  golden  light,  and  at  the  back  
pure  white  light.  On  the  ‘floor’  of  the  Sphere,  the  part  where  you  are  
standing, you see bright white light.
On the ‘floor’ of the Sphere is the Four-sided Pyramid. The square 
on  the  floor  is  the  base  of  the  pyramid,  and  the  four  triangles  that  
converge to a single point at the apex, constitute the four triangular 
outer surfaces of this polyhedron.
You will see the Sphere, but you also have to see the space between 
the Sphere and the Four-sided Pyramid. 
The colour-light on the inside and on the outside of the triangles 
is  the  same  colour-light  that  you  see  on  the  sides  of  the  Sphere.  Pay  
attention; the empty space in the pyramid where you stand to do the 
exercise is bathed in snow-white light. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY

See  that  you  are  standing  in  the  middle  of  the  pyramid  dressed  
only with your white garment, no other clothes. Your material body 
is naked. The white garment you are wearing is not made of matter, 
but of a very thin layer of white light. It covers all your body, down to 
your bare feet. You will leave the three-dimensional level. Do not see 
your material body in the middle of the pyramid as solid matter with 
bones, flesh and blood, but as a body form.
See  yourself  standing  there  facing  the  triangle  with  the  golden  
light.
In  this  pyramid  you  will  do  your  exercises  until  you  step  out  of  
the triangle with the golden light in front of you; or out of the triangle 
with  the  red  light  on  your  right  side;  or  out  of  the  triangle  with  the  
violet light on your left side. No need to turn to the triangle with the 
white light behind you since you are already in the white light, which 
in this instance represents the whole Material World of Existence. 
Later,  when  you  reach  a  very  high  level,  when  you  become  a  
master  and  you  wish  to  search  deeper,  you  can  enter  into  the  white  
light behind you, but you have to be ready for that because you will 
meet unknown forces that have yet to develop and find their way. They 
are the spirits Christ called ‘dumb and deaf,’ and the Archangels isolate 
them to give them time to develop.
How can you ascend through the Central Column of the Symbol 
of  Life,  which  is  your  Self-aware  existence  and  your  Holy-Spiritual  
conscious existence? 
You are in the middle of the pyramid. When you are ready to step 
out of the pyramid, dressed with your Archangelic Form, you will first 
proceed to see things in the Sphere three-dimensionally.
Take some steps forward until your head enters the golden light of 
the triangle in front of you. Take a few more steps, and your chest and 
heart will be in golden light. Finally, take three more steps, and you 
will be outside the triangle and in the pure golden light. Even though 
you have the brightness of your white form, you will see and feel the 
Logoic golden light penetrate your bright white form.
From there you will proceed upwards, taking three big steps. With 
the  first  step  you  enter  the  first  stoa  or  hall  of  learning,  as  you  may  
call it. You have a lot of work to do there. Then, you proceed to the 
second step or stoa. Again, there is a lot of work to be done. Hence, you 

201
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
proceed to the third step or stoa to complete the work there. I repeat, 
the  Central  Path  is  our  Self-aware  existence  and  our  Holy-Spiritual  
Consciousness or our Nature. 
Now, return to the centre of the pyramid walking backwards –do 
not turn your back to the Logos – and face again the triangle in front 
of you with the golden light. Then, turn to the right side and see the 
surface of the triangle with the red light, which illuminates the space 
between the triangle and yourself. There you will see the Governors, 
the  Logos  and  the  Michaels,  the  Lords  of  Fire.  They  will  supervise  
your  work  there  and  guide  you.  You  will  not  perceive  them  in  the  
beginning, but later, as you proceed, you will come into contact with 
them.
Pay attention to what I say now:
Where  are  you  now?  You  are  in  the  centre  of  the  pyramid  you  
created, but simultaneously you are in the centre of the solar plexus, 
in Centre 9. 
Therefore, you see two points. You have one let us say macrocosmic 
centre, and one very personal centre, which is the solar plexus. 
The  basis  of  the  Sphere  in  the  material  body  corresponds  to  the  
genitals, but it also corresponds to the whole material body. 
The middle centre of the material body is the solar plexus, but pay 
attention, when you work on the solar plexus you will not concentrate 
on the navel, but behind the navel, at a little distance from the spinal 
column. It is there that the middle point of the solar plexus is located. 
With some knowledge in anatomy you will find the real centre of the 
solar plexus, and from there you will start the work of ascending in 
your  material  body;  but  also  to  gain  access  to  another  noetical  state  
with brighter horizons, which you have to get acquainted with. 
If you are only confined to your material body, the space there is very 
limited. You have to accomplish the expansion of your Consciousness 
and the expansion of your Self-aware existence. To reach this level, my 
advice is that you work thoroughly and systematically on the Labours 
of Heracles.”

Highlighting the Symbol of Life
Y
OU  ask  me  what  the  Symbol  of  Life  means  to  us.  I  can  say  
‘Everything.’ Once I asked my father, “What can a symbol be? Is 
a symbol an Idea?”
“No, it is not an Idea, but it contains Ideas,” he said.
“Is a symbol a form, a shape?” I asked again.
“No, a symbol is not a form per se or a shape, but it entails a form 
and a shape,” he responded. “Therefore, we have symbols, which bear 
the  name  of  a  Truth,  of  an  Idea.  Each  symbol  contains  within  itself  
power, which is proportional to the Truth it expresses. Thus, symbols 
are dynamic. However, it is not helpful to have a symbol and not to 
be able to draw the power from it. We should investigate all this and 
gain further knowledge and understanding.”
Before  starting  to  study  the  Symbol  of  Life,  I  had  so  many  
unanswered questions:
(a) Where have we come from?
(b) What were we before becoming human?
(c) Why did we become human?
(d) What are we? What are we going to be?
(e) We  see  that  we  are  living  in  a  material  body,  but  what  is  a  
material body?
(f ) Why does this human material body have this human form?
(g) There are billions of forms that are not human. Have we ever 
been in any of those forms? 
“No, never! We have always been human, which means we were 
human even in the Total Wisdom of the Almighty God. The Human 
Being  was  destined  to  be  dressed  with  the  human  form  in  various  
degrees  of  vibrations  of  the  Mind,”  my  father  said  answering  to  my  
last question.
“Are we going to lose everything we own now?” I asked. 

203
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
“No,  because  if  it  were  so,  why  have  we  embarked  on  this  
magnificent journey of our Soul?”
I realised that very deep introspection is needed in order to enter 
and delve into ourselves, to leave what we call ‘waking consciousness,’ 
to abandon all forms of consciousness and enter into very High States. 
Not states of consciousness or awareness, but States of BE-ingness. 
I  understand  that  as  long  as  we  are  on  the  way,  in  the  course  of  
things,  we  will  work  on  the  various  levels  concerning  ourselves  as  
phenomena of Life. This means that we must see and study the nature 
and the state of our present-day personality, which we have to purify. 
You may say what for? In order to be free from illusions, to see the 
Truth and then enter into the Truth. 
A friend from Japan once asked me whether the Japanese can study 
and learn about the Symbol of Life. Of course, they can do it if they 
wish. I give out so much material, so many books, CDs and seminars. 
Father  placed  all  the  material  into  my  hands,  but  I  cannot  put  
everything in books. I have to meet the people coming to me to study 
and see how far I can go with them.
When  my  father  gave  me  the  teaching  I  asked  him,  “How  can  I  
know  what  to  give  out  and  what  not  to  give  out?”  He  reassured  me,  
“Do not worry, my love, I will guide you from up there.” As a result, 
I release what he allows me to release. I am sure there is a reason for 
that.
I hope that even more people will feel the need for further research, 
and choose to engage themselves in serious work.

What is the Symbol of Life?
 The Symbol of Life is Life and Power.
 The Symbol of Life is not just a symbol; it is our Life, our initiations.
  The Symbol of Life is a living elemental.
 The  Symbol  of  Life  is  for  our  upliftment,  for  sanctification  and  
glorification. It is a voyage of discovery leading to the Truth. 
 Do we have to attune to the Symbol of Life? No, we have to attune 
the Symbol of Life to us. We have to build it and attune it to us. We 
are not to change our Nature.
 When it has been well constructed, the Symbol of Life partakes of 
our Permanent Atom, that is to say, it will be assimilated with our 
Permanent Atom. 
 What does it mean to become assimilated? It means that the Symbol 
of Life loses its separate power and its existence and becomes one 
with  the  Mind.  Our  Permanent  Atom  will  ultimately  assimilate  
not only the Symbol of Life, but all our experiences.
 To  assimilate  all  our  experiences  means  to  have  them  as  part  of  
ourselves and not apart from ourselves, as separate Divinities. The 
Symbol of Life will never become Divine. It is Holy, but not Divine.
 There is only one Divinity, the Spirit-Soul-Ego.
 To  assimilate  the  Symbol  of  Life  means,  that  now  with  the  new  
knowledge of the Truth we are able to sanctify the Symbol of Life 
in  us.  The  Symbol  of  Life  is  a  tool,  a  living  instrument  for  the  
Permanent Atom. 
 Is the Symbol of Life indispensable for the Permanent Atom or is 
it possible to reach Self-realization without it?
 The Symbol of Life can be constructed by the personality of a man 
who is advancing and wishes to reach Self-realization. However, 
this does not mean that a righteous man cannot evolve without the 
Symbol. If one is a seeker and achieves purification and perfection 
through   other   channels,   his   behaviour   constructs   something   
resembling  the  centres  of  the  Symbol  of  Life  in  his  Permanent  
Atom, with the help of the Archangels.

205
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
 The  Symbol  of  Life  is  the  Truth  of  Creation.  Many  saints  have  
developed  the  qualities  of  the  centres  without  knowing  anything  
about them or about the Symbol of Life. They have even worked 
miracles.  Saint  Francis  of  Assisi  never  engaged  himself  with  the  
Symbol of Life, yet he cultivated in himself piety and service; he 
served the lepers, and in doing so, he developed powers in himself, 
with the help of the Holy Archangels. 
 We all have the centres in our bodies; God and the Holy Archangels 
created the Symbol of Life in our bodies. They created the centre of 
the genitals, the centre of the solar plexus, the centre of the heart 
and the various other centres in the human form.
 Consequently, we could say that the Symbol of Life in expression 
descended at the same time as the human form. It is a reflexion of 
our Nature. The Symbol of Life is in the Idea of Man. We also have 
the Symbol of Life macrocosmically, since it is the symbol of the 
Truth of Creation.
 When  we  build  the  Symbol  of  Life  on  the  etheric  double  of  our  
material body, we must bear in mind that we build a living entity. 
The Symbol of Life lives, it has its own Super-Consciousness.
 When we have the Symbol of Life in us it is a living talisman, a 
protecting shield, but also a responsibility. It will shake us when 
something is wrong, it will wake us up.
 We must realise that when we build it and have it in us, we are in 
contact  with  the  Archangelic  Orders.  They  help  us  and  guard  us  
but  never  interfere  with  our  personality,  while  They  protect  our  
bodies from all sorts of dangers.
 The Symbol of Life can help so that an accident will not happen to 
the material body, but it will never interfere with our personality. 
Our personality is free!
 The first principle in God and in the Universes is Freedom.

What can we learn from the Symbol of Life?
 We learn to use our bodies and to project our consciousness and 
our Self- awareness.
 We learn to build our present-day personality Self.
 We learn to purify our subconscious.
 We  learn  to  come  into  contact  with  our  Self-aware  Nature,  our  
Ego-Self. 
 We learn to balance the Four Elements and see the Total Wisdom 
of God in the least and in the highest.
 We  learn  to  work  with  the  Holy  Spirit,  in  order  to  make  our  
material body the Temple of God, so as to contact the Christ Logos 
and our Self-aware existence in our body.
 We learn to purify our present-day personality.
 We learn to make conscious contact with our Guardian Archangel 
and the Christ Logos, so as to have Their help when ascending the 
different steps, paths or, as we might say, the different levels.
 We learn to enter the Kingdom of the Heavens within us, through 
the Christ Logos. Christ said, “I am the Way, the Truth and the 
Life”  (John  14:6).  Therefore,  via  His  way,  we  will  enter  into  the  
concept of time and space-place, and experience the Crucifixion of 
our personality’s egoism in order to proceed to the Resurrection of 
our Personality-Individuality, which means to find our real Selves.
 We learn to live more consciously, and then, with the help of our 
Guardian  Archangel,  our  Self-consciousness  will  come  to  the  
surface.  Self-consciousness  is  the  awakening  of  the  Archangel  
within.
 We  learn  to  create  constructive  elementals  that  will  help  us  in  
healing work. 
 We learn to become invisible helpers, to expand our consciousness 
and  to  Self-consciously  help  others  in  need,  in  spite  of  great  
physical  distance;  and  even  to  materialise  our  body  so  that  it  is  
visible,  if  God  permits.  This  can  be  done  with  the  help  of  our  
Guardian Archangel and the other Archangels.

207
TRAVELLING WITH DASKALOS ON THE SYMBOL OF LIFE
 We learn to step out of our material body. Many people think that 
it is as simple as going to a different place, but it is not like that. It 
requires a lot of work. We must know how to build an elemental 
of ourselves through visualisation, construct it, make it solid, enter 
it and attune with it. Gaining this ability, needs a vast amount of 
training in visualisation. 
 We learn to avoid obstacles on our way, to annihilate the egoism of 
our personality and to avoid the curiosity of other people. Egoism 
can make us arrogant and prone to possess all kinds of things, and 
in this way we may become greedy.
 We learn to be sincere with ourselves and with God.
 We learn to make effective prayers, and not to simply repeat words, 
but to create constructive elementals by thought, by word and with 
a pure heart. Christ said, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they 
shall see God” (Matthew 5:8).
 My father taught me and still teaches me, to enquire and pray for 
the needs of my personality as a Soul. 
 We learn to use our real willpower and see through the Inner Light. 
 These are only very few of the things we can learn from the Symbol 
of Life.
What can we gain working on the Symbol of Life?
 Working  on  the  Symbol  of  Life,  we  simultaneously  work  on  the  
etheric double of the various parts of our material, psychical and 
noetical bodies and thereby we gradually become masters of Mind 
at different levels.
 We begin to understand the nature of Mind and the way to create 
elementals from the Mind.
 We better comprehend the relationship between thought-emotion 
and desire. We free the Mind from being the slave of emotions and 
desires, and make it the master of thinking. Then, we realise who 
and what we are.

208
 When  we  become  masters  of  Mind,  we  will  be  able  to  contact  
Heavenly Powers. Then, we will pass through the different centres 
and paths, in order to gain experience. 
 Working on the Symbol of Life, we see Total Wisdom, Total Power 
and Total Love and Goodness everywhere, in all living forms, even 
in those that are motionless. They are all expressions of Life.
 We  gain  consciousness  and  knowledge  of  our  Holy-Spiritual  
existence, in our bodies. Furthermore, we come to realise that the 
headquarters of this magnificent work of the Holy Spirit and the 
Archangels  dwells  in  our  subconscious,  which  will  later  become  
our Super-conscious. 
 We  pass  through  different,  yet  distinct  tasks,  which  are  actually  
twelve initiations in the development of our personality-self (the 
Labours of Heracles).
 We find out that we do not merely have a material body, a psychical 
body or a body of our emotions and a noetical body or body of our 
thoughts,  but  that  we  are  primarily  a  Spirit-Soul-Ego  Self.  Yet,  
we are also the Permanent Personality Self, where all our lives and 
experiences  from  all  our  incarnations  are  imprinted;  and  finally,  
we are a present-day personality self with a gross material body. 
 We  come  to  see  and  understand  the  Circles  of  Existence,  of  
Possibilities and Probabilities of all living forms.
 We  see  God’s  expression  and  Will-pleasure  for  creation  through  
the  Christ  Logos,  the  Holy  Spirit  and  the  Archangels  working  to  
form the Mind through their divine meditation. 
 We   come   to   understand   that   the   Law   of   Separateness   in   
manifestation  is  not  actually  a  reality.  Every  imbalance  in  the  
worlds of the mundane is to be corrected in time under the influence 
of  the  Law  of  Justice  and  Truth.  Nothing  ever  escapes  God,  the  
Absolute BE-ingness. 
 We are able to enter into the Laws of Creation through the Mind.
 We come to understand that by studying the Microcosm, we can 
get to know the Macrocosm.
 We  see  that  whatever  we  gain  is  our  property;  it  is  of  substance  
that  no  one  can  steal  or  destroy.  This  property  of  ours  is  in  the  
Heavens and not of matter.

A Talk with My Father about
‘The Way, the Truth and the Life’
O
N  many  occasions,  while  my  father  was  taking  a  break  from  
writing his books, we used to sit outside on my veranda, especially 
when the weather was fine, to have our coffee and rest a while before 
dinner.  Similarly,  during  winter  time,  we  would  sit  in  the  warmth  
of the kitchen, listening to the falling rain and enjoy a cup of coffee 
with cookies, which my sister used to send over. During these relaxing 
moments, all of my questions came forth; in the end, the answer ended 
up as a whole lesson.
Years  later,  I  observed  that  in  the  month  of  November  around  
my birthday, I would receive the most touching lessons ever from my 
father. Was it by chance? Personally, I do not think so. So, sitting with 
him that day I asked: “Father, Christ said, ‘I am the Way, the Truth 
and the Life.’ I know that you have given us many lessons relating to 
this, but please can you help me understand it better?”
“Make some coffee and come sit near me” he said. I did so and I 
was ready to absorb his words, eagerly waiting for him to start.
“Look,” he said, “we see the phenomenon of Life all around us. We 
use sight to look at the surface of the planet. As we know, about one 
third of the surface of the planet is dry land and the rest is ocean. All 
that we may see on the surface of this planet, which is not covered by 
water, is part of the Gross Material World. We are now bearing witness 
to the Material Universe, the Earth, the Solar System, the Planets, the 
Galaxies and to all that we comprehend about the phenomenon of Life.
We  also  see  the  phenomenon  of  Life  in  the  air  and  in  the  birds.  
Even if men work for centuries as scientists, as naturalists to record 
and study these phenomena of Life and all living forms of the animal 
and plant Kingdom, they will not succeed in fulfilling their scientific 
task completely. On the other hand, we can learn to perceive that in 
each one of these forms of Life we can feel Total Goodness, Wisdom 
and Power; the Law and the cycle of expression of this phenomenon 
of Life. We have spoken of this cycle of expression, of each of these 
phenomena of Life, in previous lessons.

Who  shall  not  see  this  immutable  Law,  the  Law  in  time,  in  the  
concept of time, the space-place of this phenomenon of Life in time? 
If we study these phenomena of Life, we will see Total Wisdom; Total 
Wisdom  in  the  Creation  of  each  and  every  species  of  these  living  
forms.”
“Well, what about Total Love and Goodness?” I said.
“This cries out to us from within each such living form, if truly 
we observe it. We shall see it as a phenomenon of Total Love and Total 
Goodness.”
“Should we call it also Total Power?” I added. 
“Where can we turn our eyes, and not see this Total Power? In the 
heart  beat  of  a  sparrow,  or  in  the  beating  of  our  own  hearts?  In  the  
harmonious flow of the juices in a tree? In plants? In the power that 
makes  buds  burst  forth  to  give  us  branches  on  the  trees  in  spring?  
Where will we not see Total Power?”
Upon  completing  his  rhetorical  questions,  a  memory  I  had  with  
him  came  to  mind:  Near  the  front  side  of  Father’s  house,  adjacent  
to  the  stoa,  stood  a  beautiful  big  tree,  with  flowers  of  vibrant  violet  
colour.  Sometimes,  while  we  were  walking  near  there,  Father  would  
ask me to stop and listen. “Listen to what Father?” “Listen,” he steadily 
repeated.  In  a  while,  being  in  full  concentration,  I  would  hear  some  
cracks coming from the buds of the flowers, as they popped open. 
I  hear  his  voice  again,  “Where  will  we  not  see  Total  Power?  All  
we need to do is to scratch the earth, gather up a handful of soil and 
observe  it  under  a  microscope.  Then,  we  will  see  Total  Power  in  the  
smallest quantity and in the greatest; in the atom and in the galaxy. 
What  is  the  difference?  Total  Wisdom  is  complete  in  both  cases,  
obedient to the cycle of the Law, which we spoke of earlier, precisely 
what I called Total Wisdom, Total Goodness and Total Power.”
He  smiled  and  went  on,  “So,  we  can  see  Total  Wisdom,  Total  
Goodness and Total Power in the smallest and in the greatest of things 
perceived.  For  that,  which  we  call  the  greatest  is  not  the  greatest,  
and that which we call the smallest is not the smallest, but only the 
smallest  that  can  be  perceived  by  human  thought  and  intelligence.  
Consequently,  what  do  we  see?  Phenomena  of  Life  containing  these  
three qualities of Life within them? And finally, what is Life?”

215
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
“Then Father, what else could Life be?” 
He instantly responded. “When the Christ Logos, the Most Beloved 
One,  revealed  His  Self  as  an  expression  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  
in  time  and  space-place,  He  said,  ‘I  am  the  Way.’  The  Way  is  the  
expression  in  space  and  time,  the  Law  of  Expression,  the  course  of  
things.  This  is  the  Way,  a  beginning,  a  journey  and  an  end  to  this  
expression.  It  is  the  completion  of  a  circle.  ‘I  am  the  Way  and  the  
Truth.’  It  is  this  Truth  which  we  must  know,  and  the  Truth  is  and  
exists all around us, within us and Life. HE Is THE LIFE. The Absolute 
BE-ingness God Is THE LIFE.”
I  looked  at  him  with  open  eyes  and  remained  speechless.  He  
continued.
“When  we  think  about  the  Absolute  BE-ingness,  we  should  
understand that It Is the Absolute Life in Its Self-Sufficiency, whether 
expressed or not. Can you now understand what is the concept of the 
unexpressed Life? 
Now, at this very moment, let us meditate to experience a part of 
this state, so that you will join those about whom the beloved Son of 
God said, ‘Some of you will never taste death,’ meaning that they will 
remain untouched by the concept of death.
If  you  would  now  shut  off  all  your  five  senses;  I  want  powerful  
meditation. Shut off your five senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, and 
above all, touch. Where are you in space and time?
Let  us  meditate  now.  Where  will  we  find  ourselves?  In  another  
dimension. We shall have a new understanding of the concept of time 
and space, we will automatically enter the fourth dimension, we will 
find  ourselves  in  what  is  known  as  the  Psychical  World.  Inside  us  
vibrates that part of ourselves, which we call the Self-aware conscious 
personality  and  the  Subconscious  Mind,  and  they  will  lead  us  into  
these worlds, where we will have harmonious co-vibrations. And thus 
a new form of sight will emerge, which we will also call sight if we 
find ourselves in those worlds, and inner vision if we see it from the 
standpoint of this world.
We  move  on.  We  now  shut  off  our  inner  vision  and  no  longer  
receive impressions with our five senses; even that which we call Life 
in the Psychical and Noetical Worlds, which gives us a different sense 
and  concept  of  time  and  space.  We  now  understand  time  and  space  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
216
differently, and yet they are still able to give us impressions. Therefore, 
I ask you, to whom do they give these impressions?
As  you  progress  beyond  the  level  of  teacher,  you  will  eventually  
succeed  in  shutting  off  the  five  senses  within  the  Psychical  and  
Noetical Worlds. Then, you will be able to seal off at will the receptors 
of impressions from all other worlds – heaven or hell – and even from 
the worlds of pure Mind, the Worlds of Concepts and Ideas. But who 
will succeed in achieving this immense task? You!
What are you, then? You are whole and full, as if you do not exist. 
You are precisely in that state, which has led Eastern Systems astray so 
as to imagine Nirvana as annihilation. However, we shall not make this 
mistake. We shall reach and surpass these states, to enter our Selves as 
Holy Monads, within our own Self-Sufficiency, but then at the same 
time we are complete. We are above time and space, expressionless in 
time and space, and yet complete, eternal, with the strength to radiate 
where we wish, when we wish. Now, we possess Total Wisdom, Total 
Power and Total Love. Before us lie the Realms of Ideas, of the Noetic 
World. And now we speak of time and space, albeit in another sense 
than that of the world of three dimensions. At all times we can perceive 
each and every experience of the form-given Life, and I am referring 
to  all  Archangelic  Orders,  both  to  those  manifesting  in  Creation  
and  to  those  remaining  impersonal  serving  other  divine  purposes.  
We can experience the Authorities, the Thrones, the Virtues, the 
Cherubim,  the  Seraphim,  Michaels,  Gabriels  and  Raphaels.  We  can  
be anything. We will be amongst those who can speak as Jesus Christ 
did,  but  not  the  Logos.  This  power  was  given  to  Jesus  Christ,  who  
spoke,  who  knew  the  purpose,  who  saw  it  clearly  before  Him  and  
proclaimed  that  Christianity,  the  new  Doctrine  of  Love  has  a  great  
potential, purpose and role to play. And when He said, ‘I am the Way,’ 
it is this Divine Way that he meant.
If you wish to be a Child of Light and to be close to the beloved 
Christ, you must take up your cross and follow Him.”
“Where  must  we  follow  Him  Father?”  I  reluctantly  asked.  He  
looked at me and said, “Not into a deep ravine, where we walk with our 
eyes closed, and neither towards a beautiful paradise, bright, pleasant 
and restful to the senses, but to the end where there is repletion and 
redemption.

217
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
For  us  there  are  States  beyond  Heaven,  where  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness  can  be  found,  and  as  we  rise  high,  so  do  our  powers  
increase in all Universes. These Universes are at the disposal of those 
who receive true Divinity.
I hope that you have understood this lesson I have just conveyed 
to you. You have to know that this lesson was given by our beloved 
Christ to HIS disciples in the garden of olives, under the moonlight. 
How  many  understood  it  then?  Only  three;  the  rest  fell  asleep,  and  
He  did  not  hasten  to  awaken  them,  nor  did  He  stop  speaking,  for  
He knew that it was not the Twelve that heard Him at that moment, 
but the Universes. He was placing the Truth within the Universes as 
Super-thought  so  that  all  who  came  later  would  be  able  to  take  it,  
learn it and assimilate it.
I am telling you that you should proceed in this direction towards 
Light  and  Truth  by  exhortation  and  not  selfish  research,  gently  and  
not by force or in agitation; time is of no importance and space of even 
less.  You  have  duties  on  the  path  you  have  chosen  through  the  way  
of  true  service  in  compassion.  I  will  repeat  what  our  beloved  Jesus  
once said: ‘Even if you give away a mere glass of water, it will not be 
wasted; it will be given to you.’ Yet, take note that your purpose is 
not the reward, not to receive, but to watch with joy as the thirsty man 
drinks and smiles. It is this joy that we must feel, and not the reward 
for ourselves.
I exhort you to follow the path of service; there is no great or small 
service, but merely the pure desire to serve. That is what counts before 
our Inner Self and the Absolute BE-ingness, the pure desire and not 
the magnitude of the service.
I  know  that  you  have  to  a  certain  extent,  seen  the  Light.  Those  
who have not seen it, those who have not been given the opportunity, 
might have an excuse – but what excuse can you have? I will not give 
you my command; I will give you HIS command: ‘Love one another as 
I have loved you.’ Yes, my Most Beloved, You are the Absolute Love; 
teach us to love as You have loved.”
“Is it easy Father to love and be kicked? He loved even those who 
crucified  Him.  Therefore,  it  was  and  it  is  easy  for  Him.  I  will  try  to  
understand that, but is it easy? Help me find out and make it easy.”

I saw he was thoughtful, then he said, “Studying one’s body, we 
can find the brain, the eyes and all other parts that make up a body. 
The  eye  cannot  say,  ‘I  am  the  eye,  the  little  finger  does  not  have  the  
same value as I.’ The brain cannot say, ‘Without a doubt, the bowels 
or the liver or the spleen or the leg or the sole of the foot do not have 
my value.’ If each part of the body began to fight about which has the 
most value, what would happen then?
Isn’t a toe destined to remain a toe, from the birth until the death 
of the material body? Isn’t the same true for a finger – can it change? 
In addition, the other parts of the body will also remain as they are 
and will serve faithfully the purpose for which they were created. The 
Creator has made them, and this suffices them.
Everything  on  the  material  body  serves  towards  the  economy  of  
the phenomenon of Life, called the human body. There is something 
else within the human body, which can circulate freely throughout the 
body (i.e. the arterial and venous blood and the afferent and efferent 
nerve impulses). But even that cannot claim to serve a higher purpose 
than that served by another part of the material body.
You are the one who dwells in the whole of your material body, and 
of course you feel good in all parts of your material body. Naturally 
you love all parts of your material body equally and you want them 
all to be in the best of health. You have never thought that your little 
toe is in an inferior position, and should feel a sense of injustice just 
because it is not the eye or the tongue.
In  the  same  way  our  Holy-Monadic  Self  emanates  angelic  and  
Archangelic  rays,  and  Men.  Our  Holy-Monadic  Self  knows  why  it  
does so. We should be satisfied with being emanations of this Great 
Self  whom  we  are  duty  bound  to  love,  serve,  and  from  which  we  
receive  service.  Take  note  of  what  I  have  mentioned  before,  ‘Within  
the  phenomenon  of  Life  serve  and  be  served.’  However,  there  is  
another State of BE-ingness, which was spoken of by Brother St. Paul, 
the Apostle of the Nations. Sometime after death this state will come 
about, ‘Then all shall be as one.’
The  Great  Origen*  of  Alexandria  (185-251  A.D.),  one  of  the  first  
Fathers  and  Theologians  of  Christianity,  dared  to  raise  his  Self-
awareness  above  the  Realms  of  Separateness  and  Duality  and  spoke  
explicitly on the ‘Apocatastasis’ or Reinstatement of All, of both Men 
and Demons (‘On the First Principles’). And for this reason he was 

219
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
relentlessly persecuted by the so-called ‘christians.’”
“And then?” I said.
“Then in Theosis, all will be One in this Holy Monad. There will 
be no ‘rebellious’ fingers or toes, or knee-caps, or this or that part of 
the body saying, ‘I am not the eye which sees,’ or ‘I am not the material 
brain.’ Take note of this detail.
From our present vantage point we are able to judge in a different 
way in time-place. However, our judgment is imperfect and potentially 
erroneous; but of course this is not the reality.
And I tell you, for the Inner Self (the Holy Monad) all Its emanations 
are equally loved, and that is why we have Brothers who are part of 
the same Holy-Monadic Self as us, and who are already in a state of 
Theosis; they were where we are now. Truly I say to you, that there was 
a time when we were where other more imperfect men are now. Men 
whom people may call thieves, men of pleasure, fools and an array of 
names.
Now,  you  understand  why  our  Most  Beloved  Jesus  said,  ‘Judge 
not, that ye shall be not judged’ (Mathew 7:1), for when we judge a 
ray of our Inner Self, our Holy-Monadic Self, it is ourself that we are 
judging; not to mention that we have no right to judge the emanations 
of other Holy Monads either.
I believe that in the light of these Truths you can better understand 
with greater clarity the words of the Beloved Jesus.”
* It is the same Spirit-Soul-Ego Self that incarnated Origen and my father. 
In order to follow the Soul in Its time and place expressions, we have first to 
examine the deeds of the reasoning present-day personality self-aware Self. In 
this case, there are many striking similarities: the doctoral thesis of my father 
that  also  concerns  Reinstatement,  the  persecutions  and  the  exact  theological  
beliefs  and  approaches  towards  the  Divine.  According  to  my  father,  Origen  
under the influence of the Christ Logos, by using the Book of Revelation made 
some changes to the uppermost Divine Part of the initial Symbol of Life used 
by Ankh-en-Aton and Khor-Aton (also an incarnation of Daskalos). Origen 
replaced the Three Holy Spheres that composed Centre 1 at the time, with the 
Great Triangle of the Holy Trinity that consists of Three Lesser Triangles (the 
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit). Thus, he placed the new doctrine of his 
Beloved Joshua Immanuel the Christ on the old Egyptian Symbol and presented 
it to the Essenes, as it is today.

220
The Path of the Initiations
H
OW can we understand the concept of God with our human mind? 
And  in  which  language  can  this  concept  be  determined?  Our  
sense organs cannot perceive the bodiless, formless, or the invisible. 
How can we measure eternity using the limited measure called time?
Absolute  BE-ingness,  as  the  Christ  Logos,  can  help  people  rise  
above the material plane in order to be able to glimpse a part of the 
Light that It emanates. However, it is not possible to find the proper 
words  to  clearly  and  simply  describe  this  magnificent  awakening.  
It  is  only  through  the  manifested  images  of  Universal  Life  that  we  
can  obtain  a  limited  understanding  of  the  greatness  of  God;  but  the  
primary source cannot be actual by any Human Being. 
Unfortunately,   contemporary   man   pursues   pleasure   without   
finding  happiness.  His  deceptive  happiness  is  without  any  real  
knowledge,  and  his  limited  knowledge  is  without  reason.  These  
conditions  are  unacceptable  to  us.  Therefore,  we  have  to  submit  to  
certain  tests  or  trials  in  order  to  attain  a  series  of  initiations.  We  as  
a  present-day  personality  self-conscious  Self  need  to  balance  the  
triangle  of  our  thoughts,  emotions  and  actions.  We  can  then  master  
Life  through  our  gradual  ascendance  as  a  complete  person,  towards  
the higher levels of the Spirit.
To  achieve  this  mastery,  we  must  bring  together  the  Hypostasis  
of our Noetic, Noetical, Psychical and Physical I-ness. This union can 
only  be  accomplished  through  the  coordinated  exercise  of  our  will,  
through intuition and meditation. By means of this harmonisation we 
can develop immeasurable abilities. We can come into Self-conscious 
contact with the secret powers of nature, and through a perfectly aimed 
effort we can reach direct spiritual understanding, open up and pass 
through the gates. Only then, we can say that we have become masters 
of our destiny, only then can we obtain divine freedom.
Only  then,  as  initiates,  can  we  become  mystics.  I  always  keep  
deeply engraved in my mind what my father used to tell me, 
“Only 
he who is self-governed can govern, only he who is free can free 
others. Remember my love that in the Universe there are stars 
in need of Governors.”

221
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
We  must  be  sincere  in  our  lives  and  in  our  actions.  We  have  to  
learn to know when to talk and when to keep silent. We should learn 
to let ourselves be guided by our Archangels and guides, and trust our 
insight and intuition, in order to know to whom we can talk and how 
far  we  can  go  in  our  discussions.  Christ  said,  “Give  not  that  which  
is  holy  unto  the  dogs,  neither  cast  ye  your  pearls  before  swine,  lest  
they  trample  them  under  their  feet,  and  turn  again  and  rend  you” 
(Matthew 7:6). Very often, it is better to teach by example than with 
words. Your Knowledge will be your Power, your Faith, your Sword 
and your Silence, your Shield.
The  initiation  into  Wisdom  and  the  Teaching  of  it  entails  the  
risk of many dangers. It is like a game between life and death. If we 
are  afraid  or  weak,  we  can  go  insane,  or  even  die.  If  we  are  good,  
righteous and strong, Life and immortality await us. This is why we 
must choose carefully. If we do not have enough courage it is wiser not 
to  proceed.  If  we  raise  our  consciousness  to  Soul-consciousness  we  
cannot fall into the abyss of darkness. If we are slaves to our emotions 
and desires, we will never see the Light. Truth will never belong to us 
unless it has become one with our I-ness and wells up from within us.
All this needs hard work, patience and prayer. Many times we will 
feel alone and helpless. Inside us there may grow waves of desperation, 
bitterness, suspicion and doubt, as though we were prisoners. At other 
times, we may have moments of peace and hope. 
We have to understand the symbolic meaning of the trials we face. 
The fire through which we will pass is less terrifying than the burning 
passions that destroy our flesh. The cold, muddy waters that we may 
find ourselves in, are not as cold as the doubt and agony that we may 
sink into.
The  Truth  will  gradually  penetrate  our  Soul.  A  new  feeling  will  
enter  our  I-ness;  something  like  detachment  from  the  Material  
World,  from  people  and  things.  We  will  feel  caressed  by  the  Breath  
of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness.  Gradual  changes  will  lead  to  a  perfect  
transformation. Another Self, more pure and ethereal, is emerging from 
the slowly vanishing earthly self. This is the moment when we kneel 
down and pray... This is the moment of perfect union with the Truth... 
We touch and hear His voice... The voice of the One who once said,

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
222
“Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot 
see the Kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man 
be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother’s 
womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, 
Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into 
the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that 
which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, 
Ye must be born again” (John 3:3-7).
Now, the Truth is revealed to us. We grasp the Truth when we go 
deep into our I-ness and see the Divine substance of the Soul. Through 
our pure heart, our wish to know the Truth and through the mastery 
of  our  earthly  self,  we  have  become  worthy.  However,  no  one  goes  
beyond this step, unless he first undergoes death and resurrection. No 
mortal being can escape death. The destiny of the Soul is eternal Life.
At this point, Ι would like to share with you an experience I had 
while my father was talking to me:
To  proceed  from  Life  to  Light,  we  must  pass  through  the  gate;  
and we have to do that while we are living in the material body. We 
must pass through the gate of terror in order to touch the first step of 
mastership. 
At first, your body feels cold. You pass through all the consecutive 
painful feelings of death, and you feel as though you are in a state of 
lethargy. Your whole life flashes before the eyes of your Soul, as if it 
had never really existed, and your consciousness, as a Human Being, 
slowly fades away.
You  feel  your  body  dissolving.  And  as  this  goes  on  you  become  
aware of the ethereal part of your existence which is now detached and 
freed. You fall into a kind of ecstasy. 
In the distance, you see a bright point which shines through the 
dark chaos. It approaches and grows, until you realise that it is a Five-
pointed Star. Its rays consist of all the colours of the rainbow.
You then see a bright, White Sun. You see the luminous brightness 
of  the  Sun  and  its  red-hot  centre  point  which  attracts  the  magnetic  
light of the Five-pointed Star.
Is this an illusion? Is it the invisible that has become visible? Is it 
the Divine Truth; the bright Star of Immortality?

223
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Suddenly,  it  disappears,  and  in  its  place  you  see  a  flower  bud  
slowly unfolding; a non-material flower, yet it is perceptible and full 
of life. It opens before you, unfolds its petals, and you see its leaves 
vibrating – the Flower of Wisdom which holds Love in its heart.
As if in ecstasy, you feel a warm caressing breath. You see it as a 
pleasant moving cloud, taking on different shapes. It gains the form 
of an angelic Idol. This is, of course, a conscious experience of your 
real Self.
Suddenly, all ends; the vision dissolves. A terrifying sound and a 
sense of being slung back into your body – you return. You feel as if 
iron rings grip your body, as if you were being put into chains, and 
you feel strong pain everywhere.
You need time to adjust yourself to Earth again...

The Governor’s Beach Meetings
E
VERY Friday my father and I had a small ritual. We would head to 
Governor’s Beach* to relax. There, I also received his teachings. On 
that particular day, my father asked me to take with us his painting of 
the Symbol of Life.
That day three friends were also in our company. After a delicious 
breakfast at Angelo’s place in front of the sea, we placed the Painting 
of the Symbol of Life on a chair and waited. Father gave it a good look 
and  smiled.  I  knew  this  kind  of  smile  very  well,  so  I  realised  that  I  
would  be  hearing  a  very  special  lesson.  Then,  a  moment  of  silence.  
I  concentrated  on  his  voice  and  prayed  that  no  one  would  interrupt  
his  teaching.  Like  a  sponge,  I  wanted  to  absorb  every  word  of  his  
and imprint it in my self-consciousness. I attuned myself to him and 
waited eagerly for him to speak. 
“We have seven colours in the white colour and also seven colours 
in  the  dark  colour,  which  are  not  visible  with  the  human  eye.  The  
colours  which  are  visible,  are  those  included  in  the  white  colour.  If  
we  put  the  seven  colours  on  a  disc  in  their  right  order  as  they  are  
in  the  rainbow  and  we  rapidly  spin  the  disc,  we  will  see  the  white  
colour.  This  means  that  all  seven  colours  are  absorbed  in  the  white  
colour,  and  they  express  the  white  colour  when  light  touches  them.  
The colours incorporate certain frequencies of vibrations. Sounds also 
comprise certain frequencies of vibrations.
* A picturesque sandy beach on the southern coast of Cyprus between Limassol 
and Larnaca, which is famous for its lovely white chalk rocks and its clear 
deep waters. During the British Rule, a former governor of the Island favored 
this  beach,  thus  the  name  ‘Governor’s  Beach.’  Nowadays,  it  is  a  popular  
resort with restaurant and camping facilities, numerous houses and apartments. 
Many  locals,  as  well  as  foreigners  have  chosen  this  serene  place  for  their  
permanent residence.

THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
We have the Holy Number 7, which is Number 5 and Number 2.
Similarly,  we  find  Numbers  5  and  2  also  on  the  keys  of  the  piano  
keyboard (five tones and two semitones). We have the note Do. Seven 
sounds are required to reach the next octave, which also starts with the 
note Do. Studying the seven sounds, from Do to Re, we have a semitone, 
from Re to Mi we have a semitone, from Mi to Fa there is no semitone, 
from Fa to Sol there is a semitone, from Sol to La there is a semitone, 
from La to Si there is a semitone, from Si to Do there is no semitone. 
Studying the keys on a piano keyboard, we identify two semitones 
(the black keys) and then three semitones (again the black keys) and 
the  white  keys.  A  symphony  or  a  song,  anything  that  expresses  a  
sound, is based on this relationship because this is the nature and the 
order of sounds. 
Two  (2)  and  Three  (3)  make  Five  (5).  Subsequently,  we  have  the  
tones  and  the  semitones  in  the  Five-pointed  Star  as  well.  The  Five-
pointed Star, which is located in the etheric double of the human body, 
in the centre of the solar plexus, is also material. We have the Number 
5 in the material plane as the five senses, the five fingers and the five 
toes. Our gross material body resembles a Five-pointed Star (the head, 
the two hands and the two feet). This is not by coincidence. We can 
do good work with our five fingers. Yet, if we had only three fingers, 
it  would  be  more  difficult,  so  we  need  five  fingers.  And  we  need  five  
senses.  Hence,  the  symbol  on  the  material  plane  is  the  Five-pointed  
Star, the Holy Number 5.
Furthermore,  by  studying  in  depth  the  upper  part  of  the  Holy  
Triadic  Triangle  at  the  top  of  the  Symbol  of  Life  we  recognise  that  
Number 5 now represents the Five Lesser Arches, the Five Principles in 
Nature or the Five Attributes of the Mind-Light. Yet, we have the Great 
Arch  above  and  the  Two  Semi-Circles  below  the  Five  Lesser  Arches,  
that now make up the Holy Number 7. These Two Semi-Circles carry 
the  Five  Principles  in  Nature,  and  thus  the  unifying  and  connecting  
Holy  Number  5  (please  refer  to  the  sketch  on  the  next  page).  The  
same applies for another set of Holy Numbers, 4 and 6. Again, in this 
setting Number 5 is the joining Number of the two, since Number 4 
is below and Number 6 is above 5. Then, we go to the next plane, the 
four-dimensional plane, which is the domain of the Six-pointed Star.

The Holy Triangle of the Symbol of Life – A painting by Daskalos. Observe the 
Great White Arch, the Five Lesser White Arches and the Two Semi-Circles.
The Five-pointed Star is now supposed to be the psychical plane, 
and  Number  4  is  the  material  plane.  But  we  always  have  the  lower  
plane contained in the higher plane and thus speak of the reflexion of 
the higher plane in the lower plane. Though we have the gate to the 
psychical body in the solar plexus, yet it is material because we enter 
the psychical body through our etheric double. 

227
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
After  the  so-called  ‘Crucifixion  of  the  personality,’  we  go  to  the  
Centre with the Six-pointed Star, which is the heart. However, there 
we also have a reflexion of the Mind as thought, the reflexion of the 
head,  or  of  the  noetical  body.  Similarly,  the  reflexion  of  the  heart  is  
in the solar plexus, the seat of Etheric Vitality as per the etheric and 
gross material bodies, and also the dwelling of the Five-pointed Star, 
symbolising the psychical body. We have thus joined them as a line 
with two endpoints. That is why upon mixing them together we speak 
of psycho-noetical centres or bodies. 
We   have   to   examine   closely   the   connections   between   the   
centres  because  these  centres,  these  worlds  and  these  bodies  are  not  
independent; they are interconnected.
In  the  material  plane  we  have  the  five  senses.  In  the  heart,  the  
psychical  plane  with  the  lower  noetical  plane,  we  have  the  super-
senses, which are not five, but six; the sixth being visualisation. What 
is then visualisation? We have visualisation from higher planes even 
in the Material World. Anyone moving in a material body can visualise 
and see things! This visualisation, which has to be developed, is of the 
higher planes. Of which higher planes, the Psychical or the Noetical 
plane?  Both,  because  feelings  and  thoughts  are  interconnected.  We  
will never be able to express a feeling unless there is a thought behind 
it.  Nevertheless,  a  feeling  is  not  a  thought.  A  thought  differs  from  a  
feeling. Again, we must have in mind the line with the two points.
As a principle, we have the line with two endpoints on the material 
plane, in the psychical plane and in the noetical plane. We meet the 
first two Arches everywhere. Which are the first two? They are here (he 
pointed to the outer Great Arch and to the line of the inner Lesser Arch 
on top of the uppermost Holy Triangle).
In  addition,  as  we  said  before,  in  between  them  we  encounter  
Number  5,  the  Five  Lesser  Arches.  They  represent  the  Five  cardinal  
Principles,  the  reflexion  of  which  is  on  the  noetical  plane,  on  the  
psychical plane and on the material plane, i.e. the Worlds of Duality. 
It is apparent now that the Holy Numbers 2 and 3, presenting Number 
5, are thus manifested. We have the three (Number 3) planes, Duality 
(Number 2) and the Five Principles or Aspects of Mind-Light (Number 
5).  The  three  adjoining  planes  may  be  symbolised  as  a  triangle,  and  
Number 2 now assumes a new role: That of joining the two sides of the 
triangle and presenting the etheric double (please refer to the sketch of 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
228
the Holy Triangle and the Two Semi-Circles touching its two sides). We 
realise that the Holy Work of the Creation of the Cosmos is conceived in 
the Highest Planes within God’s eternal meditation, and from whence 
it is projected for manifestation. We can find this pattern everywhere.
Let  us  take,  for  example  the  relation  between  the  various  piano  
notes. For example, if we combine the notes Do and Re, a discord is 
produced. If we combine, however, the note Re with the notes Mi and 
Fa respectively, a concord is produced. The same note, therefore, may 
produce  discord  or  concord  depending  on  the  note  it  is  paired  with.  
Thus, what produces concord with one tone, gives us a discord with 
the  following  tone.  As  far  as  the  semitones  are  concerned,  we  have  
to bear in mind that when the first is to be combined with the third, 
harmony is maintained. Hence, if we do not apply the rule of Number 
3, a discord emerges. 
No musician can compose unless he knows the rule of concords and 
discords. The same principle applies to colours. We have the primary 
colours and the interrelated colours. Which are the interrelated colours? 
In reality we have only three colours in one, in the white colour. Again, 
we have Number 3 as the three colours and Number 2 as the pairing 
process among the three colours that gives the combination of colours. 
What are the three cardinal colours and where do they derive from? 
It is the Logos, who is yellow, then Michael, who is red, and Gabriel, 
who  is  blue.  Mixing  yellow  and  blue,  we  have  the  colour  of  nature,  
green. Through the Logos and Gabriel, the Archangels create green. 
Now,  what  does  Gabriel  represent  in  Creation?  We  have  the  
two  poles,  masculinity  and  femininity.  Masculinity  is  the  Logos,  
femininity  is  Gabriel.  In  the  Church  we  have  the  Archangel  Gabriel  
just  like  a  woman  with  the  blue  garment  which  denotes  femininity.  
This elucidates why Gabriel visited the Virgin Mary. He was related 
to her in femininity, and he presented Her with the Six-pointed Star. 
The Madonna Lily flower has six petals. That is symbolic. The early 
Fathers  of  the  Church  were  familiar  with  these  apocryphal  truths.  
That is why the Archangel Gabriel offered Her the Madonna Lily, the 
immaculate Six-pointed Star.
We   have   Divine   Femininity   expressed   by   Gabriel   and   the   
Virgin  Mary.  Femininity  is  virgin  in  nature,  yet  femininity  begets  
everything!  That  is  the  meaning  of  femininity  and  virginity.  Matter  
is virgin, yet it begets everything, without losing its virginity. In the 

229
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Universes, everything is pure by nature and if stained in the worlds 
of the mundane, it will eventually be purified in the course of things. 
Subsequently, we have virginity and the expression of virginity, without 
spoiling virginity. Matter is all the time virgin, yet it creates numerous 
forms of Life on the planet. The fact that Mary remained virgin, can 
be  interpreted  knowing  that  the  Virgin  Mary  was  a  perfect  vehicle  
or  reflexion  of  Divine  Virginity.  Do  you  understand  what  I  mean?
Mixing  yellow  and  blue,  the  work  of  the  Logos  and  of  Gabriel,  
masculinity and femininity, we make the green colour in all its shades. 
That is why the plants and trees are green. Green is the co-vibration of 
the Logos and Gabriel. Gabriel in the old Egyptian language was Kha-
Vir-El. Kha means the desire to express the Self; Vir is masculinity and 
femininity together. If it were only masculinity, it would be Var. The i 
means femininity. The Jews say either El or Him. The El is masculine 
and the Him is feminine. They present God Elohim as masculine and 
feminine, and there is a reason for it. It is the two polarities. 
Thus, the Logos together with Gabriel create the whole vegetable 
kingdom on the planet and in the sea. If we examine a seaweed, it is 
green. We see light in space, and in the sea we have the colour blue 
but  only  after  light  enters  in.  Therefore,  we  need  Aton  as  Amon-Ra,  
which  means  Aton  in  expression,  to  cooperate  with  the  Archangels.  
So, Light is the expression of the Archangels. And which Archangels 
are expressed through the Sun? All the Orders of the Archangels, but 
mainly  behind  the  Light  are  the  Logos  and  the  Holy  Spirit.  As  all  
colours are in the colour white, everything is in the light emanating 
from the Sun. That is why sunlight gives us all seven colours. This is 
the mystery.
Mixing red and blue, we make the colour violet. That means that 
the joint work and cooperation of Michael and Gabriel or Kha-Vir-El, 
brings forth Raphael. Can we then say that Raphael is the offspring of 
Michael and Gabriel? Shall we consider Michael superior to Raphael? 
No,  Raphael  includes  both.  Since  he  contains  the  power  of  both,  
Raphael cannot be inferior. Raphael in the violet colour includes both 
the power of Michael and the power of Gabriel. Michael as a vibration 
is the red colour, the flame. If we see a forest burning, we see Michael. 
If we see a volcano, we see the red colour and also the brown colour 
in the smoke. Michael keeps his own nature. Gabriel also maintains 
his own nature. Then, Raphael partakes of the nature of both, so he is 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
230
more powerful than Michael and Gabriel. Even though Michael is the 
Lord of Fire, of Heat and of Light, and though Gabriel governs Water 
and all Liquids in abundance, Raphael is the Lord of Etheric Vitality, 
of  Power  and  Energy,  of  Electricity  and  Magnetism  and  of  all  other  
forces known and unknown in nature, in space and in the Universes. 
Moreover, Raphael is the Lord entering into the Psychical World and 
the Ethereal World of the planet. 
Thus, Fire is Michael, Water and the Liquids on the Earth and in 
the  Space  around  the  planet  are  Gabriel,  but  Electricity,  Magnetism  
and the Etheric Vitality of the planet is Raphael. 
Now, there must be a balancer. Who is the balancer? The Archangel 
Uriel. Uriel cannot be seen. It is difficult to perceive him, should we 
need to come into contact with him. Nevertheless, he is the stabiliser. 
He is the Lord of the circulation of blood, of anabolism, catabolism 
and metabolism in the body. He is the creating and dissolving force 
keeping  the  balance.  If  there  were  only  the  building  up  of  Michael,  
Gabriel and Raphael we would eat and eat and become huge as giants. 
However, that wouldn’t be natural. Subsequently, we have Uriel who 
keeps the balance. Always!
Uriel  is  symbolised  by  the  silvery  colour.  The  silvery  colour  is  
something  between  the  white  colour  and  all  the  other  colours.  The  
golden-yellow or golden colour is the Logos. Then what is the colour 
of  the  Holy  Spirit?  Both  golden-yellow  and  silvery.  That  means  the  
Holy Spirit all around us is the Balancer and Archangel Uriel is one of 
Its Ministers. The Holy Spirit is the Life-giver, and the One who keeps 
the symmetry, the proportion and the equilibrium. 
What is the combined work of Archangels Michael, Gabriel and 
Raphael  in  our  human  body  through  the  etheric  double?  The  red  
warm blood. In Raphael there is vitality-electricity; and there is also 
electricity in our body. At home, I have a radio that doesn’t play very 
well. But the moment I approach it with my hand, it plays beautifully. 
Who  is  doing  that?  Raphael.  Raphael  is  expressing  himself,  like  
Michael and Gabriel, in my material body through my etheric double. 
When  we  meditate  and  do  exercises  working  with  our  etheric  
double as kinetic ether, the kinetic ether is under the domain of Uriel. 
Motion is the nature of Uriel, the great Balancer. When we carry out 
the exercises on our etheric double, we cooperate with the Archangels. 
That is the meaning of the currents in visualisation.

231
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Visualisation  is  that  state  that  brings  our  consciousness  into  
attunement  with  the  consciousness  of  the  Archangels.  They  feel  us.  
When I tell you to create a ball of light in your hands that is burning, not 
painted as a shade of red and not solid, but burning, you can see it. In 
reality it is Michael. However, in the course of time, this visualisation 
will put us in touch with the relative Archangel. Therefore, we should 
acquire  the  skill  of  proper  visualisation.  This  is  what  will  help  us  
contact the Holy Archangels. This is the key.
Can we not approach the Archangels through music? We certainly 
can  because  sound  is  colour  and  colour  is  sound.  Moreover,  the  
Archangels  are  expressed  through  sound  and  colour.  The  tones  of  a  
Michael are usually joyful. When I want to use Gabriel, I have another 
tone.  And  with  the  same  notes  in  another  position,  I  can  express  
Raphael. Tones and colours are expressions of the Archangels. 
How do you think the Archangels create? They do so by sounding 
tones in the reverse way of hearing them. As a result, whatever you see 
created, is the song of the Archangels; the semitones are the angels. 
The Archangels are ever creating with colour and sound. If we get 
a thin plate and cover it with sand and leave it there while playing an 
instrument, we will see that a pattern is created on the sand from the 
vibrations. Vibrations are colours and sounds.
Do  you  know  what  the  secret  of  a  successful  painter  is?  The  
union,  combination  and  blending  of  colours.  Leonardo  Da  Vinci  
knew this profound truth. Unless a painter is aware of this, he cannot 
give  you  the  idea  of  depth  and  the  three-dimensional  sense  on  a  
two-dimensional  surface.  A  good  painter  represents  states  through  
the  mixing  of  his  colours,  like  springtime  or  autumn.  The  colours  
in springtime are different from the colours in the fall. Knowing the 
secrets of the Archangels he can present whatever he wishes on canvas. 
And while he paints, the Archangels cooperate with him. Through this 
cooperation, he can paint very quickly, while another painter not so 
well acquainted with the colours, will need a month or two to paint 
the same landscape. 
Painters   often   speak   of   inspiration.   But   then,   what   does   
inspiration mean? And where does inspiration come from? From the 
Archangels of course! However, if one is able to attune himself to the 
Archangels and wishes to express his ‘own’ inspiration, he can paint 
a picture in two or three hours. He knows what to do and how to join 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
232
the colours, and how to express time. The secret of a good painter is 
firstly to know how to paint and combine the colours in such a way 
so  as  to  give  the  impression  of  the  three-dimensional  world.  Most  
painters  do  not  know  this;  that  is  why  they  have  dead  landscapes.  
Secondly, successful painters need to know how to consciously attune 
themselves to the Archangels. When painting, they should offer their 
pictures for Archangelic blessings, so as to be energised by Them and 
thus become a living angelic elemental. That is when people will say, 
‘Your painting is inspiring. When I see it, I feel at peace.’ 
We know that everything can hold an elemental relating to it. A 
painting  can  have  strong  elementals  deriving  from  the  Archangels  
owing to its colours and the vibrations of its colours. The vibrations 
of  the  colours  create  elementals.  And  throughout  the  whole  time  a  
painting exists, it radiates the strength of certain Archangels. Go to the 
National Gallery, in London*. There is a big painting of Da Vinci, ‘The 
Holy Family and the Madonna of the Rocks’.** For how many years, 
does this painting exist? Yet it still radiates what Da Vinci wanted to 
paint. We have what we call dormant paintings and ‘living paintings.’ 
* ‘The Virgin of the Rocks or the Madonna of the Rocks’ is the name of two 
almost  identical  paintings  by  Leonardo  da  Vinci.  The  earlier  version  is  in  
the Louvre Museum, in Paris and the other is in the National Gallery, in 
London. Both were originally painted in oil on a 2 X 1.20 metres wooden 
panel,  but  the  Louvre  version  has  been  transferred  to  canvas.  ‘Curiously  
enough,’ Daskalos’ original painting of the Symbol of Life has exactly the same 
dimensions as the Louvre version... Father did nothing by chance, nor did he 
like to reveal everything to everyone indiscriminately. He wanted us to think, 
to observe and to do our own research and then to reach sound conclusions. 
So, when he ordered the custom made wooden board on which he affixed (by 
pinning and gluing) the canvas for the painting, he must have been aiming to 
hint or pinpoint at some concealed truth or relationship...
Both paintings depict the Madonna and the child Jesus with the infant John 
the Baptist (first cousin of the Godman) and an angel, in a rocky environment, 
from  which  their  name  derives.  Recently,  a  third  version  of  the  painting  
attributed to Da Vinci has been recovered in the Chéramy Collection.
** Father insisted on this naming of the painting, contrary to the universally 
accepted one, ‘The Virgin of the Rocks.’ For him the main theme was that of 
the Holy Family – the Three Ones that descended by Immaculate Conception 
on the hostile, rocky planet Earth. Maybe, it was his prerogative to adopt a 
different naming... After all, it is the same Spirit-Soul-Ego Self that manifested 
Leonardo Da Vinci and my father.

233
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
When we attach a living elemental to them, or a living group of 
elementals, the painting is alive! This is also a secret; but unless we 
know the art of correct visualisation, we cannot do that.
There is also another truth I want to share with you. Every time I 
want to paint a picture, I see it first. I never paint something I cannot 
see before. I envision it completed before I paint it. If I see a picture 
and I want to reproduce it, I find it impossible not to do so because 
it tortures me day and night until it is finished. This is the power of 
elementals. Nevertheless, the key is visualisation. True visualisation 
comprises a series of abilities: Making the sketch, finding the signs, 
entering through the sketch, through the symbols and the signs, into 
the Meanings, Concepts, Principles, Laws and Ideas behind the sketch. 
You have to master the skill of visualisation. When you do so, you are 
finally attuned to the Archangels, to the forces, to everything around 
you.  You  can  enjoy  nature,  comprehend  what  Life  is,  and  why  it  is  
worth living. 
Many  people  come  here  to  Governor’s  Beach.  People  come  and  
go.  But  can  they  really  live  in  the  place?  No.  If  they  have  a  pleasing  
event here, they can recollect only what interested them, what merely 
is  in  their  own  psychonoetical  shell.  However,  they  never  crawl  out  
of their individual shell. You should be aware of a Great Truth: That 
by  expanding  your  consciousness  outwards,  you  enter  inwards,  in  
yourself! Then, you may see the landscape and every step you made 
while you have lived in it. The opposite thing occurs at night, when 
you visualise what is already in your subconscious, and so by entering 
in you, you expand outwards.
I would like to share a story with you. I had some very old, but 
precious binoculars that were very expensive. One day a fellow asked 
me to lend him my binoculars, because he was headed to the Troodos 
Mountains for certain work and needed them. I was very reluctant, but 
my wife assured me that he would return them intact. So, I hesitantly 
agreed. Once there, that fellow wanted to unload his heavy bags at a 
certain  point,  and  subconsciously,  he  hung  my  binoculars  on  a  tree,  
finished with his work and then left them there. When he came back 
it was night with a full moon. Only then he realised that he did not 
know where my binoculars were. He looked in the car, but since they 
were not there, he concluded to have lost them. 
Now,  by  going  deep  within  myself,  I  could  easily  project  my  
consciousness outwards. Then, by having the binoculars registered in 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
234
my subconscious, I was able to attune myself so as to detect and trace 
where they were in the outside world. I expanded my consciousness 
from the interior towards the exterior space. In reality space is in unity; 
we humans under the influence of the Law of Duality and Separateness 
wrongly  perceive  it  as  ‘in  and  out.’  I  could  tell  my  friend  where  he  
had  to  go  to  find  the  binoculars.  By  entering  inside  and  having  the  
binoculars in me, I could attune myself to the binoculars outside, and 
I saw where they were. I spotted them hanging on the tree! Entering 
in, you can be out, and being out, you can see everything outside of 
you  in  you!  Well,  he  went  to  where  I  had  told  him  and  brought  my  
binoculars  back.  But  he  kept  wondering  how  I  knew  where  to  find  
them.  He  thought  I  had  read  his  mind,  but  I  did  not  get  it  from  his  
mind,  I  got  it  from  my  binoculars.  Because  I  loved  my  binoculars,  
there was an elemental in them, and I could trace them.
What do I want to say? Entering, you can be out, and being out 
properly,  you  are  entering  in  you.  It  is  rather  difficult  to  explain  
further,  unless  you  have  the  experiences  yourself.  If  you  know  the  
secret  you  can  enter  into  the  Kingdom  of  the  Heavens  within  you,  
and  you  can  see  Its  relations  in  the  outside  world.  Because  your  
internal space is not smaller than the outer space. It is quite difficult 
to  understand  unless  you  expand  your  consciousness  to  the  levels  
of  Super-consciousness  and  Self  Super-consciousness.  The  main  
thing  is  Self  Super-consciousness.  Paradoxically,  we  can  experience  
this  state  in  the  personality,  since  through  the  self-consciousness  
of  the  personality  you  can  enter  the  Self-consciousness  and  Super-
consciousness of the Soul. Unless you gain the self-consciousness of 
the present-day personality, you cannot feel your Soul-Self. And you 
can achieve this through sacred symbols. 
I  will  prepare  a  different  work  (which  will  not  be  included  in  
the book I write) on the triangle and its balancing, and on the Five-
pointed Star. There is much, much work to be done on the material 
plane, on the psychical plane and on the ethereal plane in between. I 
will provide you with the keys, the symbols and the work relating to 
it. Later on, the Six-pointed Star will be given to you.”
“What is the sound of the Archangels?” I asked. 
“All  the  sounds  in  proportion;  because  all  the  Archangels  enjoy  
the same sound. There can be a symphony of Michael or a symphony 
of Gabriel, which will include all the sounds. All the sounds are the 
expression of all the Archangels and all Human Beings.

235
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
My father teaching the Symbol of Life privately at Governor’s Beach.
The  main  work  takes  place  when  we  construct  the  symbols  and  
the  secret  symbols  on  them.  Therefore,  you  must  have  some  basic  
knowledge on geometry and algebra. I prefer to use Egyptian symbols. 
Obviously,  what  I  will  give  you  must  remain  secret.  This  is  because  
someone can advance himself using these symbols to acquire powers, 
which he should not misuse. He can gain control over nature; he can 
transmute metals and many other things. Of course the Archangels are 
willing to give this information to one they trust, and I am sure they 
have never made a mistake regarding those that They have entrusted. 
Even if I were to put something in the book that people who are not 
worthy may approach by accident, the Archangels will repulse them 
and  send  them  off.  The  Archangels  do  intervene  in  our  lives  and  
when They see people misusing these powers, either They shut down 
their  energy  centres,  or  They  do  not  allow  them  to  do  much  harm.”
“But there are cases where people have misused these secret powers 
tremendously, aren’t there?”
“No, no, they are only allowed to do so to a certain extent, not more 
than the Archangels will permit. And to what extent? Undoubtedly, one 
can do black magic to harm another, to even kill him if he deserves 
to  be  killed;  if  he  is  an  evil  person  and  by  that  he  pays.  Otherwise,  
people cannot do any harm to the innocent, because of the Archangelic 
obstruction.”

236
How I Started to Paint
T
HE story I want to tell you begins in 1994, when my father, known 
to you as Daskalos, became ill at the age of 82.
When Father suffered a stroke, I left my other duties and devoted 
all my time to be near him. His illness lasted for fifteen months. It was 
a very profound experience, an experience of sorrow, of learning, of 
maturing, and in a sense, of joy.
My father always wanted me to be with him and to hold his hand. 
He would press my hand onto his heart and look deep into my eyes. He 
was communicating mentally by using his eyes and facial expression.
A thousand memories welled up within me; my whole life together 
with him, a very happy life, indeed. 
One  afternoon  I  was  sitting  near  him,  lost  in  my  thoughts  and  
worries. In the situation I was in, I could not contemplate employment. 
On the other hand, my savings were slowly being used up and I did 
not  know  how  to  face  the  mounting  expenses.  I  thought  Father  was  
asleep; he had a peaceful smile on his face. In my thoughts, I said to 
him “Sleep in peace and let me think.” For the first time I would have 
to solve such a problem by myself, without his help or advice. 
Tears ran from my eyes and I did not realise that my father had 
opened  his  eyes.  Only  when  he  squeezed  my  hand,  I  became  aware  
that he was fully awake. Quickly I wiped the tears from my eyes. What 
a joke; for a minute I was under the impression that I could hide my 
worries from him.
He smiled and started to caress my hand, as if he was attempting 
to  count  my  fingers.  I  tried  to  hide  my  embarrassment  and  said,  
“Don’t  worry,  Father,  I  have  all  my  fingers.”  He  ignored  my  words  
and continued to caress my fingers and my palm. I felt some warmth 
spreading within me. It was as if a flood of love had come from him 
to me. In my distress I said thoughtlessly, “Father, what are you doing 
with my hand? Are you a fortune-teller, a palmist? No need, I know 
my future. From now on everything will be black.” A glint in his eyes 
told me that he did not agree. He shook my hand, which he still held, 

237
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
several times and then guided my hand to my forehead, gently touching 
it.  What  was  he  trying  to  tell  me?  Later,  I  realised  what  I  could  not  
understand at that moment. I embraced him and put my head on his 
chest. He started to caress my head and I said, “Ok, Father.”
After  two  days,  I  decided  to  clean  my  father’s  painting  studio.  I  
started to rearrange things and to clean the room. Suddenly, I realised 
that Father was never going to paint again in this life. Bitterness and 
anger  gripped  me.  I  wanted  to  smash  all  the  canvases.  I  grabbed  a  
canvas, put it on the painting easel, took a brush to paint and started 
to smudge different paints on the canvas.
My  sister  saw  me  and  said,  “What  are  you  doing  there?”  “I  will  
become a painter like Picasso,” I said in anger. My sister thought I had 
lost my mind. She asked me to sit and relax, so she would prepare a 
cup of coffee for me. I continued to paint and gradually calmed down. 
After a while, looking at the painting from a distance, I discovered that 
it resembled a flower.
Until that time I knew nothing about painting, apart from what I 
was taught in high school. True, I had seen my father painting, but I 
never took an interest in it.
I continued for some weeks to seriously paint flowers, landscapes 
and Archangels-until there were no canvases left.
I did not dare to show Father what I was doing. On the one hand, 
I would have loved to have his advice, yet on the other hand, I feared 
that he might object to my using up his canvases. 
A friend of mine did what I did not dare do. She showed Father my 
work and henceforth he kept on guiding me. If he was pleased with 
my  painting,  he  would  smile.  If  not,  he  would  frown  and  point  out  
where I had to improve. 
Against all expectations, my paintings started to sell miraculously. 
All  my  financial  needs  were  met.  It  is  still  a  mystery  to  me  how  my  
hands can create these paintings.
What I know for sure, is that I will not allow any doubts, nor fear 
to weaken my faith in the Will-power and Love of God, and the love 
and trust my father has bestowed upon me.

Visualisation and Music
Introduction
A
S I have mentioned before, since I was a child my father tried many 
times to persuade me to focus on concentration and listening. 
“Try to listen and hear what peace and tranquillity want to say to 
you. Hear and understand what the wind, the sea, the storm, the birds 
are trying to say to you. 
If  one  day  you  want  to  become  able  to  hear  the  sounds  of  the  
Universes,  the  sound  of  the  angels  and  Archangels,  you  must  first  
learn  to  hear  the  sounds  of  nature.  Progressively,  the  Universes  will  
start to reveal deep secret things. All is imprinted, you may say, and 
written  in  the  sounds;  all,  the  past,  the  present  and  the  future.  So,  
learn to listen. In so doing you will gradually learn to take the right 
decision concerning what you have to do.
Through  attunement  you  will  be  able  to  come  into  contact  with  
any outer Universe in the Macrocosm and any cell and atom in your 
body in the Microcosm. This is very important in healing.
You  can  easily  attune  yourself  to  the  composers  who  lived  in  
the past, who are still living now through their music and who will 
continue to live in the future. Hear them through the sounds of their 
music. They have so many things to tell you.
Now, we will hear music from a composer. In the beginning you 
will hear only the music. Maybe you will not be able to hear the voice 
of the composer but gradually you will hear what he or she wants to 
tell  you.  You  may  hear  why  he  or  she  wrote  this  piece.  Perhaps,  for  
expressing his pain, sorrow, anger or joy?
Try  to  understand,  while  having  all  these  thoughts  and  feelings,  
in a way the composer was talking to himself and at the same time he 
was attuned to the Universes. He was the receptor of divine sounds, 
which were brought down to get incorporated into his music.
First concentrate, breathe deeply and let love, peace and tranquillity 
enter your heart centre. It is Mind Vitality coming from the Universes.

239
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Now,  concentrate  on  the  sounds  unfolding  around  you.  Hear  
every  sound  outside  or  in  the  room.  Distinguish  slowly  each  sound  
and concentrate on each of the sounds separately.
You can stay attuned to the music or to the composer. In this way 
you can receive more and more information. But don’t forget that you 
are an individual BE-ingness. Pay attention while doing this work. Do 
not  allow  the  egoism  of  your  personality  to  lead  you  to  fantasy  and  
illusions.”
I  remember  that  day  so  clearly.  It  as  if  this  happened  yesterday.  
Father summoned me to his study and announced: “All this afternoon 
is only for you. I will talk to you about a great composer. We will hear 
the music which I have chosen for you to hear together, and I want you 
to attune to him.”
“Sit here near me and relax,” he said. I looked at him. He closed 
his eyes and I immediately realised that he was attuned to someone; I 
did not know with whom. Maybe, he came into contact with the spirit 
of the composer or with an authority on music, because the amount 
of  details  conveyed  was  extraordinary.  Furthermore,  he  deliberately  
asked me to record our discourse on tape – that I possess to date. Father 
had the amazing ability to instantly attune himself with whoever and 
whatever he wished to, with the greatest of ease. For him this was all 
natural. And then, he started talking to me:
Beethoven
Ludwig van Beethoven was born on December 6, 1770, in Bonn and 
passed over on March 26, 1827, in Vienna. Beethoven had an intense 
and  troubled  life.  He  was  an  idealist.  His  music  is  very  expressive  
and delivers a message of moral power, freedom, brotherhood and joy, 
which one can gain through intense effort. Beethoven had a sparkling, 
vital personality that is reflected in his charming music.
The characteristics of Beethoven’s music are power (not as violence, 
but as strength) and self-mastery. Beethoven’s personality and music 
were  very  productive.  In  some  of  his  compositions,  he  conveys  the  
aversion he felt, in such a way that the listener feels attracted. We can 
sense  it  when  we  hear  the  first  part  of  
Symphony  No.  2,  Opus  36. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
240
After the slow introduction, we find a theme of rhythmical power that 
develops up to the climax of the celebration and the brilliant ending.
We  see  this  power  bursting  out  in  
Symphony  No.  3,  Opus  55,  
the ‘Eroica.’  The  special  history  of  the  ‘Eroica’  guides  the  listeners  
to  an  understanding  of  its  spiritual  message  and  encourages  them  
to  participate.  Beethoven  had  high  hopes  of  Napoleon  at  first.  He  
admired  the  ideas  of  the  French  revolution  and  adored  Napoleon.  
He  believed  him  to  be  the  ideal  political  figure  to  disseminate  the  
ideals  of  freedom,  equality  and  brotherhood  all  over  Europe.  When  
he composed 
Symphony No. 3, Beethoven dedicated it to Napoleon 
Bonaparte,  and  it  was  originally  titled  
‘Bonaparte.’  However,  when  
Napoleon  proclaimed  himself  emperor  of  France  on  May  20,  1804,  
Beethoven  was  astonished  and  enraged.  In  a  fury,  he  took  the  front  
page of the 
‘Eroica’ and obliterated Napoleon’s name, exclaiming: “So 
he, too, is nothing more than an ordinary man. Now, he will trample 
on all human rights and indulge only in his own ambition. He will place 
himself above everyone and become a tyrant!”
We can consider this symphony as an opus on heroism itself; not 
military heroism, but something more profound: The will to overcome 
or simply endure difficulties, such as fear, pain, inner turmoil and the 
terror of death.
We  will  hear  the  first  and  second  part  of  the  symphony.  The  
first  movement  is  written  in  sonata  form  and  the  second  one  is  the
 
‘Funeral March.’
For many people, ‘Eroica’ is the greatest of all purely orchestral 
symphonies. It seems to contain a universe of contrasts, that Beethoven 
miraculously brought together in a vibrant framework of strength.
In 1808, Beethoven wrote 
Symphony No. 6, Opus 68, the ‘Pastoral.’ 
Its five movements are a magnificent summation of Beethoven’s love 
for nature and the open countryside. It is full of sensational evocations 
of sounds for which the increasingly deaf composer must have had to 
rely from his long-term memory: The bird song in the 
‘Scene at the 
Brook,’
 rural dances in ‘Peasants merry-making’ and a shepherd’s 
pipe  in  the  finale,  
‘The  Shepherds’  song.’  There  is  also  a  thrilling  
storm  movement  in
  ‘Thunderstorm.’  Beethoven  wrote:  “It  is  a  
matter more of feeling than of painting in sounds. How happy I am to 
be able to walk among the shrubs, the trees, the woods, the grass and 
the rocks! For the woods, the trees and the rocks give man the resonance 
he needs.”

241
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Let  us  now  see  the  Overture  to  Egmont,  Opus  84  -  a  set  of  
incidental music for the play of the same name by Johann Wolfgang 
von Goethe. The story - the heroic resistance of a Flemish nobleman, 
the Count of Egmont, to Spanish oppression - must have deeply stirred 
Beethoven.  Count  Egmont  lived  through  his  own  spiritual  struggle,  
having  to  choose  between  the  love  of  a  woman  and  the  love  of  his  
people.
Beethoven was much attracted to Goethe and he had set to music 
three of Goethe’s poems in 1809. Later he spoke with great enthusiasm 
of the possibility of providing music for 
‘Faust.’
What can we say about Missa Solemnis, Opus 123?
Missa  Solemnis
  is  a  unique  musical  achievement;  a  completely  
novel  conception.  There  are  moments  of  incomparable  serenity,  the  
‘Et  Incamatus’  and  the  ‘Benedictus.’  They  demonstrate  that  the  
unorthodox  Beethoven  could  still  be  touched  by  the  great  catholic  
symbols, the incarnation of Christ and the celebration of His sacrifice 
in the Blessed Sacrament.
A change takes place in the final 
‘Agnus Dei.’ The horror of the 
still recent European war invades the music in the form of threatening 
trumpet and drum fanfares, which play a relentless march. This war 
theme interrupts the prayer for ‘Inward Peace,’ and the soloists resume 
singing a more passionate prayer for ‘Outward Peace.’
In   composing   this,   Beethoven   must   have   remembered   the   
bombardment of 1809 and perhaps also his own near-encounter with 
the French forces on his way from Bonn to Vienna in 1792. On the title 
page Beethoven wrote: “From the heart - may it go back to the heart.” 
Later, regarding 
Missa Solemnis he confessed: “My chief aim was to 
awaken and permanently instill religious feelings not only in the singers 
but also in the listeners.”
Some  people  think  perhaps  Beethoven  meant  that  if  religious  
feelings  were  aroused  by  the  music  itself,  then  it  has  created  within  
the listener a far purer form of religion than that which exists within 
the walls of a church.
According   to   Schindler,   one   of   Beethoven’s   closest   friends,   
Beethoven’s personality changed at the beginning of the composition 
of  the  
Missa  Solemnis.  During  the  compositional  process,  the  
composer was oblivious of everything earthly and seemed as if he was 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
242
transported  into  another  world.  This  is  Schindler’s  account:  “In  the  
living room, behind a locked door, we heard the master singing parts of 
the fugue in the Credo - singing, howling, stamping.... the door opened 
and  Beethoven  stood  before  us  with  distorted  features,  calculated  to  
excite fear. He looked as if he had been in mortal combat with the whole 
host of contrapuntists, his everlasting enemies.”
Many believe that his finest achievements are the last five 
String 
Quartets.
 These works are private music, intended for the appreciation 
of a few select friends, rather than a large public audience. He finished 
the  first,  
Opus  127,  No.  12  in  E  flat  major,  in  January  1825,  and  
it  is  considered  to  be  the  culmination  of  Beethoven’s  lyrical  musical  
character, especially the slow second movement on one of his loveliest 
song themes.
The next one is 
Opus 132, No. 15 in A minor, dedicated to Prince 
Nikolas Galitzin. It is a dark, troubled work, but with a radiant slow 
movement subtitled 
‘Holy Song of Thanksgiving by a Convalescent 
to the Divinity, in the Lydian Mode.’
 Beethoven wrote this piece to 
thank God after recovering from a serious illness, which he had feared 
would have been fatal. The song develops on the base of an alternation 
between praying in wonderment and returning back to life. 
The next quartet, 
Opus 130, No. 13 in B major, is rather like a 
baroque multi-movement suite.
The Great Fugue (Grosse Fugue), Opus 133, was written in 1825, 
when Beethoven was completely deaf. Originally, it was the finale for 
Opus  130.  However,  the  
Fugue  was  so  demanding  of  contemporary  
performers and unpopular with audiences that Beethoven’s publisher 
urged  him  to  write  a  new  finale  for  the  string  quartet.  
The  Great  
Fugue
 was then published as a separate Opus number, Opus 133. It 
certainly has an uplifting conclusion, but before there is a movement 
called
 ‘Cavatina,’ a song of profound sadness. To the composer, The 
Great Fugue
 was his favourite piece. 
The  quartet  which  Beethoven  himself  thought  the  greatest  of  all  
was 
Opus  131,  No.  14  in  C  minor,  dedicated  to  Baron  Joseph  von  
Stutterheim. Beethoven is quoted as having told a friend his evaluation 
of the quartet: “Thank God there is less lack of imagination than ever 
before.” It is said that upon listening to a performance of this quartet, 
Schubert remarked, “After this, what is left for us to write?”

243
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
In  a  good  performance,  the  effect  can  be  like  an  impassionate  
spiritual journey. The slow section before the finale is a heart-breaking 
account  of  Beethoven’s  personal  life.  Beethoven  had  gained  custody  
over  his  nephew  Karl  after  Karl’s  mother  had  passed  over  in  1825.  
Karl was almost driven to distraction by Beethoven’s eccentricity and 
suffocating possessiveness. Besides, Karl had serious gambling debts. 
In 1826, in a state of deep emotional turmoil, he tried to shoot himself. 
He  failed,  but  his  injuries  required  long  treatment.  Beethoven  never  
recovered from this shock, but he seems to have realised at last that he 
had to set Karl free.
The final quartet, 
Opus 135, No. 16 in F major, seems to point 
to  a  new  direction.  It  is  more  modest,  more  ‘classical’  in  scale.  An  
ominous  questioning  figure  marked  with  the  words  “Must  it  be?”  
receives, at the end of this last quartet, a cheerful and almost irreverent 
reply, “It must be!”
Symphony No. 5, Opus 67 - ‘The Symphony of Destiny’
From its very opening bars - probably the most famous beginning 
to  any  symphony  in  history  -  
Symphony  No.  5  is  an  intense,  
ferociously  driven  exploration  of  Beethoven’s  tragic-heroic  C  minor  
mode. All together it creates a clear theme warming the soul, instilling 
joy  and  hope.  It  is  the  joy  of  the  one  who  has  conquered  a  hostile  
destiny, confirming the power of reason and courage.
Symphony No. 5 is a humanistic poem, and each one of us will 
find something out of it in our own life. In this symphony you can find 
the philosophy of Kant.
Kant connects morality with freedom. To be free is to follow our 
own rational principles instead of just our desires; to follow our own 
judgement; to act on maxims that adhere to Universal Laws. Hence, to 
be free is to be moral. So, freedom and morality ultimately belong to 
the same mystery. We know that we are free by being able to discern 
our duties and actions.
To  see  ourselves  as  free,  we  must  see  ourselves  as  part  of  two  
worlds:  a  sensory  world  and  a  higher  intelligible  world.  Acting  
morally has supreme moral worth because through it we participate 
in a higher order of existence. This is the basis for the dignity of the 
human person as an end in itself.

244
It is not by chance that in Beethoven’s notes the following phrase 
appears: “The bright sky above me, the Moral Law within me.” This 
expression  cannot  only  be  seen  in  the  symphonies,  but  also  in  the  
sonatas. We can detect it in 
Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Opus 13 
commonly known as the 
‘Pathetique.’ 
After  Beethoven’s  death,  the  young  Mendelsohn  played  the  first  
movement on the piano. Goethe commented: “It is great, really crazy! 
You reach a point where you think that the house will collapse. Imagine 
if  it  was  to  be  performed  by  an  orchestra!”  According  to  Beethoven,  
destiny is knocking on our door in this way.
Beethoven’s Sonatas
There   are   so   many   beautiful   sonatas!   Beethoven   wrote   the   
‘Pathetique’  in  1798  and  dedicated  it  to  his  friend,  Prince  Karl  von  
Lichnowsky. In the first movement of this sonata, Beethoven’s tragic-
heroic  C  minor  mode  stands  before  us,  fully  rounded  for  the  first  
time. The dark, slow introduction, marked 
‘Grave,’ and the hurtling, 
anguished 
‘Allegro’  represent  a  new  kind  of  musical  drama.  This  
sonata demonstrates the power of the spirit that has overcome pain.
We have 
Piano Sonata, Opus 53, No. 21, ‘Aurora,’ the so-called 
‘Waldstein-Sonate,’  dedicated  to  Count  Ferdinand  Ernst  Gabriel  
von  Waldstein,  Beethoven’s  first  important  patron.  Here,  we  see  a  
metamorphosis in comparison to Haydn and Mozart.
The  traditional  sonata  form  progressively  moves  into  a  clash  
between two principles: the ‘Principle of Reluctance and Opposition’ 
and the ‘Principle of Entreaty.’
The  first  part  is  mainly  written  in  sonata  form.  The  listener  
will think that it is an exercise to practice with the hands. Then the 
theme starts to become clearer and this change is like an openness to 
brightness. 
The second part is dark and mysterious. It is very short and soon 
passes  to  the  third  part  that  touches  the  peak  of  joy.  It  finishes  with  
very strong chords. It is like the composer is asking us to take part in 
an exciting, enthusiastic adventure.
Let us hear the sonata 
‘Aurora’ and try to perceive the elements 
I  mentioned  before.  We  can  find  these  characteristics  almost  in  all  
of  Beethoven’s  sonatas  (
‘Apassionata,’  ‘Pathetique,’  ‘Moonlight  
Sonata’ 
and so on...).

245
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Goethe’s  written  judgements  of  Beethoven  vary:  “His  talent  
astounded me, but unfortunately he is a quite intractable person, and in 
fact it is not unjustified if he finds the world detestable, but as a result, 
of  course,  he  does  not  make  things  more  enjoyable  for  himself  or  for  
others. He is much to be forgiven and also to be pitied, since he can hear 
nothing.” But to his wife, that same year, Goethe wrote: “I had never 
before met a more comprehensive, energetic or intense artist.”
Beethoven   died   on   March   26,   1827.   The   composer   Anselm   
Huttenbrenner was with him: “After 5 o’clock there was suddenly a 
terrific clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning, which filled 
the  death-chamber  with  a  harsh  light.  After  this  unexpected  natural  
occurrence, which shook me greatly, Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his 
right hand and looked up for several seconds with his fist clenched and a 
very serious, threatening expression... As he let his hand sink again to 
the bed, his eyes half closed. My right hand supported his head, my left 
hand rested on his breast. No more breath, no more heartbeat.”
The  city  of  Vienna,  which  had  feted,  derided,  ignored  and  
marvelled at him during his lifetime, managed a magnificent tribute 
after  his  death.  There  was  a  huge  funeral;  something  like  20,000  
people  turned  up  to  pay  their  last  respects.  No  composer  before  
Beethoven  had  ever  been  honoured  like  this.  The  pianist-composer  
Johann Nepomuk Hummel helped carry the coffin, and amongst the 
torch-bearers were Czerny, Schuppanzigh, the poet Franz Grillparzer 
and  the  thirty-year-old  Franz  Schubert,  then  just  over  a  year  away  
from his own death. At the gates of the cemetery, the actor Heinrich 
Anschutz, an acquaintance of Beethoven’s in his last years, delivered 
a funeral oration written by Grillparzer. The words show eloquently 
what this difficult, contradictory, sometimes painfully unhappy man 
had by then come to symbolise:
“We who stand here at the grave of the deceased one are in a sense 
the representatives of a nation, the entire German people, some to mourn 
the passing of one celebrated part of that which remained to us from the 
vanished radiance of the art of our homeland, of the spiritual efflorescence 
of the fatherland. The hero of poetry in the German language (Goethe) 
still lives - and long may he live. But the last master of resounding 
song, the gracious medium through which music spoke, the man who 
inherited  and  magnified  the  immortal  fame  of  Handel  and  Bach,  of  
Haydn and Mozart, has ceased to be; and we stand weeping over the 
broken strings of an instrument now silenced...
 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
246
An instrument now stilled. Allow me to call him that! For he was 
an artist, and what he was, he was only through art. The thorns of life 
had wounded him deeply, and as the shipwrecked man strives for the 
redeeming shore, he flew into your arms, oh wondrous sister of the good 
and true, comforter in affliction, the art that comes from on high!... He 
was an artist, and who shall stand beside him?... He traversed all, he 
comprehended everything. He who follows him cannot continue; he must 
begin anew, for his predecessor ended only where art ends...
He was an artist, but also a man, a man in every sense, in the 
highest sense. Because he turned away from the world, they called him 
hostile, and callous because he shunned feelings. Oh, he who knows he 
is hardened does not flee! He withdrew from his fellow men after he had 
given them everything and had received nothing in return... But in his 
death he kept a human heart for all men, a father’s heart for his own 
people, the whole world.
Thus he was, thus he died, thus he will live for all time!”

He was especially fond of Beethoven. At the age of 17 he gave a memorable

‘Pathetique’ and ‘Moonlight Sonata’), in the ‘Magic Palace Theatre,’ in Nicosia.

A week later, my father called me again to his study. I knew that 
we  would  work  again  on  the  visualisation  of  music.  “What  will  we  
work  on  today  Father?”  I  asked:  “On  Frederic  Chopin,”  he  said.  He  
chose the records he wanted me to hear and attuned to them and the 
composer,  I  relaxed  on  the  chair  near  him  and  he  did  the  same  as  
before. He started to talk to me about the life of Frederic Chopin.
After that he stated: “Now, let us hear some of his music.”
The Music of Frederic Chopin
Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, Opus 21, No. 2 in F Minor 
This  piano  concerto  was  composed  in  1830,  before  Chopin  had  
finished  his  formal  education  -  he  was  around  20  years  old,  and  he  
was  in  love  with  Constanza  Gladkowska.  This  love  was  platonic,  a  
temporary  blindness  and  he  never  expressed  it  to  her.  However,  he  
spoke about it with his friend Titus Woyciechowski.
On  October  3,  1829,  he  wrote  to  him:  “Maybe  unfortunately  for  
me, there is an ideal, which I respect with all my heart and of which 
I am silently dreaming every night for six months now. I am telling 
everything I can, only entrusting myself to my piano.”
Try  to  feel  the  romantic  feelings  of  Chopin  talking  to  his  piano,  
using it to make his secrets known.
Étude Opus 10, No. 12, called ‘The Revolutionary Étude’
This  piece  of  music  was  dedicated  to  his  friend,  Franz  Liszt.  A  
tormented  heart  is  crying  out  for  freedom  and  dignity.  Longing  for  
freedom is not just the privilege of a nation, but also of every Human 
Being. Consequently, this music is of authentic worldwide value.
Feel the emotion of the one who closely revives the epic history of 
a suffering nation and the pain of a child who is far from his beloved 
country (like Chopin).
I want you to feel that you can love your country, but simultaneously 
be  a  citizen  of  the  whole  world.  Maybe,  in  this  way  you  can  avoid  
being trapped in the elemental called ‘nationalism.’
The Farewell Waltz, Opus 69, No. 1 (L’ Adieu)
This  waltz  was  originally  written  as  a  farewell  piece  to  Maria  
Wodzinski, to whom Chopin was secretly engaged. When he met her, 

249
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Chopin  composed  and  dedicated  this  piece  to  Maria.  This  period  of  
time was a very happy one in his life. 
Try to feel Chopin’s feelings when he met Maria and fell in love.
Ballad Opus 23, No. 1
Chopin asked Maria to marry him, but her parents refused. Maria 
accepted  her  parents’  decision  and  Chopin  sank  into  the  depths  of  
depression. He put Maria’s letters in a box and wrote on the top: ‘My 
sorrow.’  His  only  consolation  was  his  friendship  with  Mendelssohn  
and Schumann. We can also feel his sorrow in the marvellous etude 
Opus 25, No. 7.
Schumann  wrote  in  a  letter  to  Heinrich  Dorn  about  the  Ballade,  
“I received a new Ballade from Chopin. It seems to be a work closest to 
his genius (although not the most ingenious) and I told him that I like 
it best of all his compositions.” After quite a lengthy silence he replied 
with emphasis, “I am happy to hear this since I too like it most and 
hold it dearest.”
Prelude Opus 28, No. 15, called ‘Raindrop Prelude’
Chopin composed this piece of music at a time when he was ill. It 
is built on the persistent repetition of a note, like the rain falling down 
monotonously and inexorably. 
Feel  the  intense  loneliness  and  agony  during  the  duration  of  an  
endless storm. Feel it. It is full of hallucinations, shaking from waves 
of agony; yet it is so refined from a pianistic point of view.
Chopin completed most of his celebrated twenty-four 
‘Preludes’ 
for  piano  including  the  ‘Raindrop’  while  staying  on  the  island  
of  Majorca  with  his  mistress.  This  particular  prelude  reflects  his  
happiness at being with his mistress George Sand (Aurore Dudevant 
with her real name), but also his melancholy as his illness continued 
to progress.
The raindrop effect of a softly repeated note adding a sadness to 
an otherwise tranquil opening melody, and climaxes in an apparent 
downpour before the initial calm returns.
Chopin became very ill while they were on the island and told of 
how he was visited by a series of local doctors, recalling that “The first 
said I was dead, the second that I am dying; and the third that I am 
going to die, but I feel the same as always.”

But  fearful  of  infection,  the  local  people  refused  to  rent  him  
anywhere to live, so he moved with his lover and her children to the 
deserted monastery of Valldemosa, where the last of his preludes were 
finished.
Fantaisie Impromptu, Opus 66, No. 4
This piece is a solo piano composition and one of his most well 
known  pieces.  It  was  composed  in  1834  and  dedicated  to  Julian  
Fontana.
Despite  Chopin’s  request  to  Fontana  that  the  piece  was  not  be  
published, Fontana did so anyway, in order to show it to the world.
The  piece  uses  many  cross-rhythms.  The  opening  tempo  is  
marked allegro agitato. The tempo changes to largo and later moderato 
cantabile. The piece then changes back to the original tempo where it 
continues  in  C-sharp  minor  as  before.  It  closes  with  an  ambiguous  
fantasy-like  ending,  in  a  quiet  and  mysterious  way.  In  this  fantasy  
impromptu,  Chopin  gives  the  impression  that  he  improvises,  but  
behind the phenomenal improvisation there usually exists intensive 
work.
Feel  the  freshness  of  springtime  that  this  piece  emits.  Absorb  it,  
feel it first in your psycho-noetical body and then in every cell of your 
material body.
The  Etheric  Vitality  spreads  in  your  body,  giving  it  strength.  
Harmony and Peace reign in your existence.
At the beginning of the third week, I started wondering, ‘Will my 
father call me again to continue or will he forget or have something 
more important to do?’ It seems that he picked-up my thoughts and 
said: “Yiota, tomorrow come to my study to continue our work.” My 
heart started to sing, but I pretended that I was calm and said: “As you 
wish Father.” He smiled and did not say anything.
The  following  day,  I  was  checking  the  clock  every  half  an  hour,  
I did not want to lose a minute and I ran to his study on time. “I am

THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
ready Father. Who is next?” He looked at me smiling, I saw so much 
love in his eyes when he asked me to sit. A thought came to my mind. 
This  love  is  for  me  or  for  the  music.  Again,  he  catches  my  thoughts  
and says, “For both.” Instantly, I turned red, I did not like him to read 
my thoughts so much.
Today  we  will  talk  about  Antonio  Lucio  Vivaldi.  He  was  born  
on  March  4,  1678  and  died  on  July  28,  1741.  His  nickname  was  ‘Il 
Prete Rosso’ (The Red Priest), he was a Venetian priest and a Baroque 
music composer, as well as a famous virtuoso violinist; he was born 
and  raised  in  the  Republic  of  Venice.  The  Four  Seasons,  a  series  of  
four  violin  concertos,  is  his  best-known  work  and  a  highly  popular  
Baroque piece of music.
His father, a barber and talented violinist himself, had helped him 
try a career in music and made him enter the Cappella di San Marco 
orchestra,  where  he  was  an  appreciated  violinist.  In  1703  Vivaldi  
became a priest.
“Now, let us go to some of his music,” he said. 
The Music of Antonio Vivaldi
The Four Seasons (Le Quattro Stagioni)
It is a set of four violin concertos. Composed in 1723, ‘The Four 
Seasons’
 is Vivaldi’s best-known work, and is among the most popular 
pieces  of  Baroque  music.  The  work  has  been  recorded  on  numerous  
occasions.
The  concertos  were  first  published  in  1725  as  part  of  a  set  of  
twelve, Vivaldi’s 
Opus 8, entitled ‘Il Cimento dell’ Armonia e dell’ 
Inventione’ 
(The Contest of Harmony and Invention). The first four 
concertos  were  designated  Le  Quattro  Stagioni,  each  being  named  
after a season. Each one is in three movements, with a slow movement 
between two faster ones. The four concerts are connected in a unified 
plan that makes them an autonomous work, a compact unity.
At  the  time  of  writing  the  Four  Seasons,  the  modern  solo  form  
of the concerto had not yet been defined (typically a solo instrument 
and accompanying orchestra). Vivaldi’s original arrangement for solo 
violin  with  string  quartet  and  basso  continuo  helped  to  define  the  
form.

We have:
(a) Spring, Opus 8, No 1
(b) Summer, Opus 8, No 2
(c) Autumn, Opus 8, No 3
(d) Winter, Opus 8, No 4
The  four  concertos  are  inspired  by  nature  and  the  change  of  
seasons. It is not simply music that imitates nature, but it is inspired 
by  nature.  Music  of  a  wonderful  structure  is  created.  These  pieces  
have  their  own  meaning,  their  own  artistic  autonomy,  rising  to  an  
authentic poetry and a superb musical achievement.
Spring
The  first  part  is  a  nimble,  quick  allegro,  that  reminds  us  of  the  
joyful  awakening  of  nature  in  springtime.  We  hear  the  song  of  the  
birds,  the  fresh  murmuring  of  the  water,  the  rustle  of  the  leaves  on  
the spring wind. The short insertion of a quick storm makes all these 
voices stop for a while to start their song again.
The second part is a largo. It reminds us of a pastoral scene. It is 
an interval of tranquillity and peace.
The third part is an allegro and constitutes a pastoral dance.
Summer
In the summer heat all of nature is dulled. Only the song of some 
birds interrupts the heavy, suffocating and exhausting silence. A storm 
is coming; the horizon is dark, black and threatening.
Summer is a season of intense colours and opposed exaggerations. 
In front of the threat, which is not a refreshing storm, the shepherds 
are  seized  by  fear.  Then,  the  storm  bursts  out  and  all  is  music.  An  
admirable  richness  of  rhythms  characterizes  the  third  part  of  the  
concert (presto).
Autumn
The  first  part  celebrates  the  joy  of  vintage  and  the  harvest,  the  
immense  energy  of  the  threshing  floors.  The  music  is  singing  a  
celebration  march.  Then  it  whirls  around,  turning  into  intoxicating  
j oy.

253
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
The second part is an adagio. The music creates a sense of mystery. 
It is talking about sleep, a pleasant relaxation that succeeds the excited 
rhythm of the festivity. It presents with a sweet torment the sadness of 
autumn, the special colours of this season and the leaves that are falling 
from the trees. The days are becoming shorter, cold is approaching. 
Feel this sadness hiding in a secret peace. Feel also the joy of the 
intimacy of friendship and the conversations around the fireplace.
The third part is about hunting. It starts with a march. We hear 
the echo of the hunting horns. It is a light, humorous march in front of 
these well-armed hunters who are protected by the dogs and walking 
boldly towards a poor animal whose fate is to be killed.
It is as if the music follows the chase. The violin expresses the last 
quiver  of  the  animal,  its  loneliness  and  its  destiny  to  die.  Then  the  
march starts, saluting the triumph of the hunters.
Winter
The  first  part  starts  with  an  allegro  of  unusual  richness  and  
controversial moments. Bring to your mind the feeling of severe cold 
and hear the violin express shivering sensations.
In the second part, a warm melody prevails. It brings to our mind 
what is pleasant in the house - the warmth of a heated fireplace, the 
delightful conversation there, while wind and rain are raging outside.
This   musical   masterpiece   is   full   of   diversity.   See   someone   
walking,  carefully  looking  where  to  place  his  feet  so  as  not  to  trip,  
and somebody else skating on a lake with self-confidence, without the 
fear of falling down. It is a marvellous musical game that alternates 
between moments of concentration and moments of freedom.
Vivaldi portrays the real dimensions of winter. You see that winter 
is also Life!

The Music of the Spheres
One  day  my  father  introduced  me  to  the  music  of  the  Strauss 
Family. In the beginning, I was under the impression that it was just 
going to be dancing music, pleasant, cheerful and easy to listen to. The 
second thought that occurred to me, was that I would not have to go 
through the strange, painful or scary experiences I had when listening 
to other genres of music. I anticipated that at this time I would only 
have pleasant feelings. Before concluding my thought, I saw a smile 
on my father’s lips. Another exclamation of surprise, came out of my 
mouth, accompanied by the thought, that maybe I was wrong. “Let us 
see,” I reflected.
The next day my father asked me to come to his study in order to 
continue our work on Johann Strauss. “Are you ready?” he asked. “Yes, 
let us dance,” I answered. Once more I tried to conceal my perplexity. 
“We  will  hear  the  music  of  the  spheres,”  he  announced.  “Let  us  see  
how you will experience the heavenly bodies.”
I  closed  my  eyes,  I  concentrated,  relaxed  and  started  to  breathe  
consciously  and  rhythmically,  that  was  his  advice,  so  as  to  keep  my  
bodies in balance. At the beginning, a warm feeling spread all over me, 
a very pleasant vibration; it was as if something was spinning in my 
body. Something had risen from my subconscious into my memory. 
“Oh, there are the discs in my etheric centres radiating in their own 
light!”  Suddenly,  the  vibration  changed,  the  movement  of  the  discs  
became spherical and the colour-light in my etheric centres assumed 
the same pattern of motion. 
The spherical movement continued, but after a while something 
expanded from within me; the light was so bright that I was not able 
to see any colour at all. At the same time, I felt a movement within, 
although I was not moving. It is not easy to convey this odd situation 
I was in, neither to explain it in words. 
My  real  Self  was  out  of  my  bodies,  looking  around  in  space.  It  
was so beautiful and majestic out there observing the heavenly bodies 
and simultaneously watching and observing my own bodies. I had a 
strange feeling, as if my ‘childish self’ was talking to someone, maybe 
to my real Self and saying how beautiful the mechanism of my bodies 
was. It was so peculiar because I could feel my ‘childish self’ inside my 
bodies, but at the same time I could feel that I was outside my bodies 

255
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
as ‘my other real Self.’ I do not know how long I experienced this state. 
Was it moments, minutes or an eternity? What I surely know is that I 
was in a state of Absolute Peace.
It  seemed  that  my  father  intervened,  because  I  heard  his  voice  
telling me sweetly to concentrate again on my material body, which I 
did halfheartedly. I thought that I had fallen asleep and so I apologised 
to my father, “Sorry I slept, but I saw a very beautiful dream.” Father 
turned  to  me  and  said,  “It  was  not  a  dream  my  love,  it  was  not  a  
dream!” At that age, I was not able to distinguish between imagination 
and Reality and Truth. Now, I know.
Father continued to train me for several years in this way, so that 
I would be able to go deeper and deeper into this wonderful work of 
visualisation in music.

256
The Divine Symphony
“L
ET us meditate now,” my father said in a calm, profound voice. 
His  overall  facial  expression  changed,  indicating  that  he  was  
about to convey a most sacred and apocryphal contemplation:
“Close  your  eyes  and  relax  your  material  body.  Breathe  deeply,  
comfortably, rhythmically and consciously, and silence every emotion 
and thought.
Use imprinting ether to visualize a big hall. Its floor radiates white 
light.
Mentally see yourself, your real form, dressed in white light and 
standing in the middle of the hall.
Bring  your  etheric  hands  together  and  stretch  them  out  in  front  
of you. Then, mark a point on the floor. From this point, use your left 
etheric hand to slowly draw a straight line of golden light along your 
left side to a point behind you. 
See, feel and hear the light pouring from your etheric hand.
Now, construct an identical line with your right etheric hand along 
your right side to a point behind you.
Breathe deeply and consciously and then visualize the golden light 
forming  a  third  line  that  connects  the  two  points  behind  you.  You  
are  now  standing  in  the  centre  of  an  equal-sided  triangle,  each  side  
measuring about 3 meters in length.
Now, see a golden flame rising from the floor of the right side of the 
triangle. It embraces your right foot, comes up through your right leg, 
approaches the solar plexus from the front side of your body, crosses 
over  to  the  left  side  of  your  body,  moves  on  under  your  left  armpit,  
rises to your left shoulder and moves over to your right shoulder in a 
straight line. From there it spreads out and up, as three golden rays.
Another  golden  flame  rises  from  the  floor  of  the  left  side  of  the  
triangle.  It  embraces  your  left  foot,  comes  up  through  your  left  leg,  
approaches  the  solar  plexus  from  behind  your  body,  crosses  over  to  

257
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
the right side of your body, moves on under your right armpit, rises to 
your right shoulder and moves over to your left shoulder in a straight 
line.  From  there  it  spreads  outwards  and  upwards,  as  three  golden  
rays.
Now,  white  light  starts  to  caress  your  feet  from  the  rear  of  the  
triangle. The light enters your pelvic area, ascends all the way up your 
spinal column and rises above your head, like a torch. The source of 
this light is your spinal column.
Take deep conscious breaths. Now, see a white-rosy light radiating 
from your heart centre like a bright sun.
From  the  white  light,  which  is  your  spinal  column,  a  sky-blue  
light begins to radiate like a bright sun from your solar plexus, and a 
golden light begins to radiate like a bright sun from your head. Above 
your head the torch of light creates three white flames. 
Concentrate on your heart centre for a few minutes. 
We will now enter into the sky-blue light of the Higher Noetical 
World.  In  this  world  we  will  meet  Archangels.  It  is  easier  for  us  to  
enter  this  world  now,  because  we  are  dressed  in  our  Archangelic  
Garment or Form. 
Mentally, the Archangels of that world will make our three suns 
radiate  brighter  light:  Brighter  sky-blue  light  in  the  solar  plexus,  
brighter white-rosy light in the heart centre and brighter golden light 
in and around the head.
See  the  three  white  flames  above  your  head.  When  St.  Paul  said  
that we should not allow the Spirit within us to be extinguished, he 
meant this torch of light. Let it shine! (Note: ‘Quench not the Spirit’ 
First Epistle to the Thessalonians 5:19.)
In a while a guiding Archangel appears in front of you. He knows 
your language, because He is sending out His radiations to each one 
of you. I will talk to Him; be assured that He will receive my appeal 
mentally.”
“May we have Your blessings and teaching?”
“See and feel His smile. The Archangel is talking to you mentally:”

An Archangelic Guided Meditation
“There  is  but  one  reality;  that  is  Truth  and  Harmony,  
which  is  You,  your  Self.  Feel  it!  Each  one  of  you  represents  
a  tone  of  this  harmony  and  all  of  you  together  compose  
a   symphony   that   the   Logos,   the   Archangels   and   the   
angels  rejoice  in.  Try  to  see  it  in  your  meditation.  Try  to  
understand  what  you  can  add  to  this  symphony,  what  you  
can  add  to  the  time  and  place  symphony  that  Absolute  
BE-ingness  bestows  upon  you  to  express.  I  will  help  you.
‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.’ See 
this reality; He and you compose this symphony. 
Now, let me work with your psycho-noetical body to give 
you a tone of harmony, one of our gifts to you.
Take  deep  and  comfortable  breaths  and  concentrate  on  
your heartbeats. Feel them and hear them. Feel yourself in the 
whole area of your chest.
A  bright  sun  radiates  from  your  head.  It  is  not  exactly  
golden or white light, but a light that does not exist on Earth.
See now how your heart centre radiates a light that is more 
white than rosy. The rosy light is concentrated more and more 
in the middle point of the heart centre. Feel the vibration.
See  how  the  sky-blue  light  in  the  solar  plexus  slowly  
turns to white light, not exactly white, more like mother-of-
pearl.  Feel  the  vibration  and  see  how  it  slowly  spreads  into  
your whole body.
Your feet and hands assume a mild violet light; the light 
in your thyroid slowly changes from orange to canary-yellow, 
and  at  the  area  of  the  genital  centre,  the  colour  of  the  light  
slowly turns to aquamarine.
Now,  complete  health  reigns  in  your  noetical,  psychical  
and  material  bodies.  Keep  this  tone  of  harmony  and  take  it  
with you to Earth.”
“Mentally  thank  the  Archangel  for  his  guidance.  Decrease  your  
vibrations, and slowly feel your material body again...”

In Memory of My Father – About Healing
T
WENTY-FOUR  years  ago,  on  August  26,  1995,  my  father  left  his  
material body on Earth and went to live in the highest Heavenly 
Spheres. 
In  commemoration  of  his  teaching  and  of  the  greatest  and  most  
beautiful gift he implanted in me, I would like to start my first seminar 
in London with one of the lessons that touched me deeply. It showed me 
a stream of Light to follow, that will always keep me on the Right Path.
Whenever I study, meditate, or work on healing, I feel and realise 
the  meaning  of  every  word  he  said,  flowing  and  spreading  in  my  
BE-ingness, in my existence as a personality and in my material body 
like the Logoic healing ‘Living Water.’ Yes, the Christ Logos vitality is 
everywhere and in us. It heals everything. The only thing we have to do 
is to acquire a certain body of knowledge concerning our true nature, 
in order to be able to fully attune our Self to His power and thus let the 
healing ‘Living  Water’  run  freely  in  us.  This  healing  ‘Living  Water’ 
has  the  power  to  sweep  away  everything  that  should  not  be  in  our  
personality and material body, and it can purify and heal us provided 
we cooperate and do our part in the healing process. 
Many people came to my father asking him to cure them. At that 
time,  I  did  not  know  the  reason  why  he  smiled  upon  hearing  such  
utterances.  Now,  many  are  the  people  coming  to  me  requesting  the  
same thing. I cannot know if my father was pondering and smiling in 
the same way as I am thinking and smiling now, when I hear people 
say, ‘Heal me!’ 
Sometimes, I wonder if people really believe that I am able to play 
the role of God. I believe they forget that I am a Human Being just like 
them. It will be a pleasant and welcome surprise if one day someone 
would come to me and instead of simply saying, ‘Heal me,’ he would 
ask, ‘Panayiota, can you please tell me how I can understand and work 
better with my personality-self and how I can heal my body?’ To heal the 
material body one needs to restore psycho-noetical imbalances, which 
are  often  the  primary  cause  of  many  physical  ailments,  otherwise,  
these problems may well reappear.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
260
Now,  I  would  like  to  clarify  a  few  issues.  It  is  a  totally  different  
thing to become a clinical therapist, a psychical therapist or a healer, 
and yet again it is another thing to become a spiritual healer.
The Clinical Therapist
The  clinical  therapist  must  be  well  educated  and  know  by  
experience  many  things  about  the  human  personality.  The  therapist  
should be able to understand and help people overcome their psycho-
noetical problems, by changing their fixed ideas and helping them to 
de-energise  negative  elementals.  This  kind  of  therapist  must  know  
how to talk, when to talk and what to say, but most of all the therapist 
must  know  how  to  listen  and  what  to  focus  on.  Therefore,  a  lot  of  
patience and love is needed.
The Psychical Therapist 
A lot of training is required in order to become a psychical therapist 
or a healer. We have to exercise and meditate a lot in order to master 
the etheric double of our material body as much as possible.
It is vital for us to be acquainted with the anatomy of the human 
body  in  a  proficient  way,  and  know  how  to  deal  with  the  Etheric  
Vitality  of  the  etheric  double  of  the  body.  Etheric  Vitality  provides  
the Life principle to the material body. By studying and practicing, we 
will  find  out  about  all  the  qualities  of  the  etheric  double,  especially  
that of creative ether. We will discover that creative ether is not under 
the authority of our personality, but under the authority of the Holy 
Spirit.
We will also find out that our etheric double is the mould inside 
and around the body, through which the material body is created and 
kept  in  good  health.  We  will  realise  that  the  Holy  Spirit  ever  cures  
the wounds from within the material body, by using Etheric Vitality. 
Therefore, Etheric Vitality treats wounds through the etheric double.
Can everyone do that? Yes, everyone! But who will do it? We may 
say, ‘I.’ Yes, but who are we? If we want to do it, we have to know who 
we are. We must find the I-ness of the Ego-Self in us, which is not our 
present-day personality self with a name, expressing certain feelings 
and petty thoughts.

261
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Thus, before we decide to become a psychical therapist or healer 
we should know our Self, we should be in conscious contact with the 
source of Etheric Vitality and be full of this energy at all times.
The Spiritual Healer
Once we gain the ability to creatively use the etheric double and 
the Mind entrusted to us by the Holy Spirit, we will then hear Him 
through the vibration of the Logos saying, ‘Enter in the joy of your 
master and you will have joy!’ 
Perfect health in the bodies of any Human Being is a Divine Law. 
The  joy  of  our  Master,  the  Creator,  is  for  us  to  consciously  become  
co-creators.  To  enter  into  the  joy  of  our  Master,  means  to  enter  into  
Reality and to find the Absolute Reality. Absolute Reality is the Absolute 
BE-ingness; Total Wisdom, Total Power, and Total Love and Goodness.
Then, we realise through our experiences that we are a spark in a 
Sun; we are light in Light, life in Life. You will be able to balance all 
kinds of forces, whether they be material, psychical, noetical or spiritual. 
Making good use of these forces, we will hear our Divine Father 
say, ‘You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler 
over many others.’ 
This  means  that  from  the  Worlds  of  Separateness  we  enter  the  
World of Love of God. God is Love. God is everything. Unless we love 
all  and  everything,  we  cannot  become  a  channel  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  
and therefore we cannot be a spiritual healer.
No matter what kind of therapist or healer we are or we want to 
become, we always have to start our work with a prayer. We have to 
cleanse our present-day personality and our material body. Real prayer 
needs concentration. That means consciously having our attention not 
solely on the words of the prayer, but on the actual meaning of the words. 
Sometimes we do not even have to utter a word; we enter our Self 
and turn fully to the Infinite BE-ingness. For my father, this was real 
prayer.

262
The True Essence of Healing
I 
have  noticed  that  many  people  want  to  train  themselves  more  
thoroughly in the field of healing, which is something I agree with. 
I can understand their need, since many, many years ago talking with 
my father, I requested exactly the same. I pleaded him to give me more 
information and practical guidance about healing, wanting the same 
thing as many others nowadays aspire to. But my father was always 
telling  me  that  I  must  be  patient.  He  kept  reminding  me  that  first  I  
should get to know the theory, then proceed to learn about how things 
function and subsequently put them into practice. 
For  instance,  I  have  always  wanted  to  know  how  to  help  myself  
and  thereafter  extend  this  to  helping  others.  The  impression  that  a  
great many want to follow a similar path is obvious. 
It is like I can still hear my father saying:
“Do  you  know  what  the  etheric  double  of  your  material  body  is  
composed of? Where is it? How will you find it? How does it function? 
At the beginning you must know what the ethers are and then learn 
to  use  them.  You  should  know  how  the  kinetic  and  aesthetic  ethers  
function in the different bodies. How the imprinting ether works from 
the noetical body down to the material body. And you should get to 
know as much as possible about the creative ether.
At the beginning you will do it subconsciously. In time, through 
practice  you  will  learn  and  know  how  much  you  can  receive  from  
a  certain  type  of  ether,  and  how  much  you  can  get  from  another  
type of ether, constantly observing the good results in your practise. 
Otherwise, the overall endeavour will not be fruitful.”
Let  me  add  something  more.  When  my  father  was  training  me,  
even  though  I  had  no  health  problems,  he  would  ask  me  to  first  
work on my body. He advised me to learn how to transfer the energy 
from  one  part  of  my  body  to  the  other,  to  sense  and  see  the  energy  
flow, to observe how it functions and how to store the energy in the 
body. When I felt pain in my liver, I was instructed to place there the 
exact amount of energy so as to stop the pain. This is a very delicate 
training process because if we make the mistake of giving more energy 

263
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
to  an  ailing  part  than  what  is  needed,  we  will  feel  more  pain.  Only  
if  we  exercise  and  practice  on  our  body,  will  we  know  how  to  work  
and help others in need, always provided that they shall ask for our 
assistance. Now, on the other hand, working with our personality-self 
is a wholly different task.
Maybe, you will not believe what I am about to tell you. From what 
I can remember, my father would continuously teach and train me. It 
sounds peculiar to accept as true, but the best training I received from 
him was during the last fifteen months of his life on Earth. Although 
he  was  ill  and  gradually  completing  the  cycle  of  his  life,  yet  he  was  
still teaching me! Through his frail body, he would demonstrate and 
instruct me intensely on how to help other people. 
I  remember  sitting  close  to  him,  trying  to  give  him  some  of  my  
energy. I was praying and, out of my love for him, I forgot all that I 
had  learned  from  him  all  these  years  up  to  that  moment.  Mentally  
talking to God I pleaded with Him, “God, take all the energy from me. 
Take it all and give it to him! I want him to live.” I opened myself and 
let the energy flow to his body. That moment he opened his eyes and 
looking at me, he mentally said “No, not like that!” I was in shock! I 
realised and felt that I was harming him instead of helping him. 
He took my hand and placed it on his head. That was the moment 
I  could  actually  feel  the  amount  of  energy  drawn  from  me.  He  was  
holding my hand and putting it on his head. I realised that he had a 
headache  and  that  he  only  wanted  energy  for  that  part  of  his  body.  
He  showed  me  in  which  manner  I  should  work,  how  much  energy  
each  organ  needs  according  to  its  individual  condition  and  ailment.  
Many  were  the  times  when,  without  the  presence  of  any  particular  
problem, he would hold my hand, drawing energy and putting it to 
a  certain  part  of  his  body.  Just  to  show  me  how  much  energy  was  
required there. He would also do the same for other parts, showing me 
the different combinations of the vibrations and the benefit, they can 
bring to our body. 
So,  if  you  wish  to  help  others  you  must  learn  to  do  it  properly.  
Otherwise  it  is  better  not  to  do  it  at  all.  Father’s  advice  was  to  start  
always  first  with  a  prayer,  and  then  proceed  with  an  exercise  or  
meditation to cleanse our body and our present-day personality self.

I  always  do  a  meditation  exercise,  not  just  when  I  have  a  
discomfort somewhere in my body, but also when I want to cleanse 
my personality-self and be fully prepared to help. 
It  is  very  important  to  become  a  pure  channel.  I  remember  my  
father telling me, 
“If you want to help someone, you have to give 
clean, pure energy as much as possible. What quality of living 
water  are  you  providing?  Is  it  contaminated  or  is  it  clean?  
Be sure that it is clean. So, first you must render your body 
and personality unstained, and then start to work. That is of 
paramount importance.”
He also warned me, “The people, who come to you, already carry 
a heavy load, which they want to get rid of. So, they do not need 
your garbage as well! Do not use them as a garbage container.”
He also taught me how to make the sign of the cross, apart from the 
exercises we have on the Symbol of Life. We use the cross while doing 
the  exercises  on  the  Symbol  of  Life.  He  told  me  not  only  to  say  the  
words mentally, but also to enter into the deeper meaning of the words. 
You  bring  together  the  first  three  fingers  of  your  right  hand  and  
touch your forehead saying, ‘Thine is the Kingdom,’ going down you 
pass through the centre of the heart and continue down to the centre 
of the solar plexus. Here, you stop and declare, ‘Thine is the Power.’ It 
is here that the Holy Spirit demonstrates its work. Then, you come up 
again to the heart centre, stop and mentally state, ‘Thine is the Glory.’ 
Here, lies the seat of the Christ Logos. From the middle point of the 
heart,  you  direct  your  fingers  horizontally  straight  over  to  the  right  
side of your body and in touching your right armpit you say, ‘Forever.’ 
Then,  you  take  your  fingers  back  to  the  heart  and  continue  to  direct  
them  straight  over  to  the  left  side  of  your  body.  Touching  your  left  
armpit you now say, ‘And ever,’ meaning in all eternity. 
I  have  shown  you  the  way  we  perform  the  sign  of  the  cross  in  
the Orthodox Church. The Catholics make the sign of the cross in a 
slightly  different  way.  After  saying,  ‘Thine  is  the  Glory,’  they  direct  
their fingers from the heart centre first to the left side and then to the 
right side. The horizontal line connecting the two shoulders pertains 
to the concept of time as eternity. Thus, in this aspect the direction of 
the fingers is insignificant.
Knowing  it  or  not,  in  making  the  sign  of  the  cross,  we  create  a  
protecting shield around us. We protect ourself from the elementals 

265
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
we send out subconsciously, but also from the elementals we attract 
from others or that are being sent to us. When we send an elemental, 
it  exits  from  the  centre  of  our  solar  plexus.  But  when  it  returns  to  
us,  it  comes  back  seven  times  stronger  and  enters  through  all  the  
seven  centres  of  energy.  So,  we  must  pay  attention  to  what  kind  of  
elementals we project. If we send out a bad elemental, it will return to 
us and enter through all our centres of energy, seven times stronger. If 
we send out a good elemental, again it will come back to us and enter 
through all our centres of energy, seven times stronger. This is another 
way of protecting ourself before starting our work. 
Now, you may wonder: ‘Before starting my work, is it necessary to 
make the sign of the cross with my hands?’ If you do not know how to 
use your etheric hand, then yes of course, you must use your material 
hand. But in time, you will learn how to use your etheric hand and you 
will no longer need to use your material hand.
I  know  that  some  people  will  be  suspicious,  when  they  see  you  
making the sign of the cross before starting your work. So, it is better 
not to show anything at all. 
I remember once that a gentleman came and asked for help. I was 
aware that he did not know anything about our work. So, I told him 
to  close  his  eyes  and  mentally  see  his  body  filled  with  Christ-Light.  
In this way, he would enable me to help him more effectively! There 
was  no  need  to  do  anything  else.  He  looked  at  me  and  said,  “Sorry  
lady,  I  am  not  a  Christian.  I  am  a  Muslim.”  I  smiled  and  replied,  
“Dear sir, I believe the Christ Logos is for all Human Beings, not only 
for  Christians.  The  Christ  Logos  is  the  Light,  which  gives  Light  to  
every  Human  Being  coming  into  the  world.  Thus,  He  gives  us  Self-
aware Expression, our Hypostasis. He is not only giving ‘the Self ’ to 
Christians, but to every Human Being in the Universes. So, if we open 
ourself to this Light, we will do our part in the healing process.”
Now,  I  would  like  to  share  with  you  a  few  more  things  my  
father would always mention, before doing an exercise leading us to 
meditation. 
We are able to know up to the Seventh Heaven, the Seven Universes. 
There are more, but as Human Beings we can comprehend only up to 
the  Seventh.  Each  Universe,  each  world  and  every  individual  plane  
and sub-plane is governed by its own set of Laws. Father always tried 
to help me understand the Laws of Life. So, he would often give me 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
266
the following example. He said, “If on the material plane you throw 
a stone up in the air and it comes down and falls upon your head, are 
you entitled to complain to God? Have you been unjustly punished? 
Do you want God to suspend the Law of Gravity so to spare you the 
consequences of your stupidity?”
In conducting our lives, we all make mistakes and therefore suffer 
various  injuries.  Such  injuries  settle  in  the  noetical,  psychical  and  
physical bodies.
He  always  advised  me  that  upon  finding  myself  troubled  with  a  
problem, it would be much better to start working on myself, rather 
than to sit helplessly cursing Life and God. He told me, “Observe and 
find out what you have been doing to your bodies. Study your emotions, 
your desires and especially the fixed ideas in your personality. Let us 
say you experience an uncomfortable physical sensation, for example, 
a sour stomach or an aching head. Stop and study the matter before 
setting off to a pharmacy or a doctor’s office.” 
He  encouraged  me,  adding,  “Go  to  the  source  of  the  problem  
instead of bearing it in your bodies. Usually you will find out that you 
can trace the discomfort back to elementals you have been creating, or 
revitalising along with elementals that you have been accepting from 
others.  It  is  you  who  accepts  them  from  others.  So,  learn  to  replace  
negative elementals with positive ones. If you allow your desires and 
your thoughts to control you, you quickly become enslaved by them.” 
“Father,” I asked, “tell me, how is it possible to become a master.” 
He smiled and said, “Use reason and love in your thoughts, and 
self-consciously create your desires and control your emotions. Only 
when you use reason in your personality and accept the responsibility 
for  your  life,  can  you  call  your  life  yours.  The  Holy  Archangels  are  
working ceaselessly in your bodies to keep them healthy and strong 
so that you may enjoy a comfortable existence. The least you can do 
is  to  stop  interfering  with  their  Holy  Work  and  learn  to  cooperate  
consciously with these Holy Entities for your own benefit and well-
being.” Such was my father’s advice!

267
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Forging Psychotherapists
We  should  know  about  Life-energy,  the  etheric  doubles,  the  
energy centres and the ethers. We must also know how to create balls 
or spheres of light. We use them in healing work; but not always, only 
when it is necessary. Of course, there are many other methods that we 
use in healing. Using balls of light, we learn to formulate the Mind 
Super-Substance. We must give a form to the balls or to the spheres 
of light and sustain energy in them. We also learn to use elementals 
in healing.
I would like to make some reference to the so-called ‘therapists,’ 
the  people  who  want  to  help  others.  Father  had  advised  me  to  be  
conscious  of  a  variety  of  things  before  I  dare  to  say  I  want  to  help  
other people. 
We  have  to  know  that  our  Spirit-Soul  is  pure,  perfect  Light,  an  
offspring  of  God.  Coming  into  the  Worlds  of  Separateness,  we  are  
enclosed with Mind-Light of different vibrations finally reaching the 
lowest level, which is Mind as solid matter. The Holy Spirit and the 
Holy Archangels build our material body, atom by atom, through the 
mould, the etheric double of the material body. If we see things from 
bottom  up,  we  know  that  the  material  body  is  the  lowest  or  more  
dense of all our bodies. But we also have the psychical body and the 
noetical body, which we will not talk about now. 
The   etheric   doubles   contain   Light-Energy,   Etheric   Vitality.   
Without  their  etheric  doubles  our  bodies  would  be  lifeless  empty  
shells. Our material body is an exact replica of its etheric double. Our 
body has limbs, and so does its etheric double. Every time we move 
our material body, the etheric double moves accordingly. 
It  is  possible  to  train  ourselves  to  use  our  etheric  limbs  self-
consciously. What do we do now? When people move their hands or 
feet, the etheric double of their material body subconsciously moves. 
Most of them do not even know the existence of their etheric double. 
We must learn to use it consciously.
Some might wonder: ‘Why should I learn how to use my etheric 
double consciously or self-consciously?’ This is advisable because an 
etheric limb has far fewer limitations than the dense material body. It 
can for example be lifted out of the material form, extended and used 
to penetrate gross matter. I will give you an example:

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
268
Let  us  assume,  I  want  to  see  and  work  in  the  spine  of  a  person.  
Using my material hands, I can touch only the surface of that person’s 
body. I cannot go into his body. But with my etheric hands, I can go 
into the body, while my material hands remain outside the body. 
In  our  exercises,  we  often  work  with  our  etheric  hands.  We  use  
the imprinting ether of the etheric double to visualise psycho-noetical 
light pouring from our etheric fingers, and we direct it to those parts 
of the body, we want to work on. We can also use aesthetic ether to feel 
and kinetic ether to direct the energy. If we are very well trained, in 
the use of creative ether, we can dematerialise unwanted tissues in the 
body or materialise what is needed to be there, if this is the will of God. 
We also have to learn to see with our etheric eyes, and to hear with 
our etheric ears. Let me share a story with you. When I was a child, 
my father used to take me for a walk on a hill near our house in the 
morning and in the afternoon. He would lift me up from the ground 
and put me on his shoulders. On the way, I would caress his curly hair. 
He then would ask me to sit on the ground in a relaxing way, to look 
at  and  observe,  to  see,  feel  and  touch  everything  around  me.  At  the  
beginning, I did not know why he asked me to do all this. It seemed 
crazy to my childlike eyes but I obeyed and followed his instructions. 
He  would  teach  me  to  concentrate  and  listen.  Pointing  to  a  bee  that  
was very far away, saying, “Can you hear it?” I replied, “Hear what?” I 
would occasionally see something, but could not hear anything.
For years he was training me with so much patience, to hear and 
to see things from a distance far away, without the use of my material 
eyes! Using my material eyes, it was not possible to see so far; to see the 
bees flying or hovering in the air and moving their wings. Or to see and 
to observe their wings, and hear them using my etheric ears. He would 
ask me to sit down on the ground, to feel the vibration of the Earth 
and breathe in the fragrance of the flowers. He told me to concentrate, 
breathe  and  distinguish  from  what  flower  the  scent  was  coming.  
He  asked  me  to  feel  the  pulse  and  the  beat  of  my  heart.  He  was  
expecting me to enter within and feel the pulse of my heart or to feel the 
pulse of Life in my body, which is something different. He encouraged 
me to go in, to feel and mentally see how the blood circulates in my 
veins and to hear it. He said, “You will discover that the blood in your 
veins has a different sound to the blood in your arteries.” 
From  my  own  observation,  I  can  say  that  the  blood  in  my  veins  

269
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
sounds  like  waves.  It  may  seem  very  funny  to  say  so,  but  it  is  like  
sitting near the sea and hearing the waves whispering. On the other 
hand, the arterial circulation is rather like a lion roaring. It is a totally 
different sound. I learned to observe all these things. In the course of 
time, I realised that everything he was asking me to do, was all part 
of my training.
All  these  things  are  important  to  know  because  when  it  will  be  
necessary  to  touch  a  certain  person,  we  will  need  to  know  what  is  
going on in his body, apart from all the other details we will have to 
observe at that moment. 
As we advance in our self-conscious awareness, we will discover 
that  we  can  train  ourselves  to  use  the  etheric  doubles;  not  only  the  
etheric double of the material body, but also of our psychical and our 
noetical  bodies  for  much  greater  work.  We  have  exercises  and  work  
with the centres in our etheric doubles. On the two sides of our body 
we have centres of energy and on the Middle Column, where the spine 
is, we have centres of self-awareness and consciousness. The Hindus 
call  them  chakras;  we  call  them  centres  of  energy.  These  centres  are  
positions throughout the etheric doubles, varying in size and function. 
You  must  also  know  that  every  pore  of  our  skin  has  a  centre,  each  
fingertip and every single gland.
What is the nature of these centres? If we study a bathtub while 
it  drains,  we  will  see  water  funnel-through  and  flow  out,  forming  a  
whirlpool. That is the typical basic shape and motion of our etheric 
centres. Each of our three bodies displays their own energy centres on 
their etheric double. In the Book of Revelation, which was written in 
the  Greek  language  by  John  the  Evangelist  -  Father  Yiohannan,  the  
etheric centres of the material body are called ‘Churches.’
Father  explained  to  me  that  the  centres  on  the  etheric  double  of  
our gross material body are called ‘Churches’ because churches signify 
gathering. At this point, it is imperative that we discriminate between 
the word ‘Church’ from the word ‘Temple’ (Naos-Ναός, in Greek). The 
word ‘Church’ (Ekklisia-Ἐκκλησία, in Greek) indicates the gathering of 
people or the congregation, and not the ‘Temple’ or the place of gathering, 
as  it  is  erroneously  translated  into  English.  In  these  centres  our  
elementals are gathered. It is our spiritual duty to purify our ‘Churches.’ 
On the etheric double of our psychical body the centres are called 
‘Lamps.’ On the psychical body the centres of energy must always be 
fed with Light-Energy. We must be prepared, and always ready to be 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
270
in His service. As my father talked to me about these centres, he would 
take me back to the parable of Christ, ‘The five wise and the five unwise 
virgins’ (Matthew 25:1-13).
The ten virgins were awaiting the coming of Christ (the Bridegroom) 
with their lamps. Five of the virgins had enough oil in their lamps, the 
other  five  did  not.  As  Christ  arrived,  the  five  wise  virgins  followed  
Him into the house, while the five unwise virgins went out to buy oil 
to put in their lamps. Upon returning, they found the door closed, and 
stayed out of the bridal feast. So, we must always be prepared, to have 
our ‘Lamps’ (Centres) shining and be vigilant waiting for His call. 
According  to  the  Book  of  Revelation,  the  Centres  on  the  etheric  
double  of  our  noetical  body  are  respectively  called  ‘Stars.’  Father  
further enlightened me, “See the radiance of the stars. You must make 
the centres of your noetical body shine like the stars. Only in this way 
you  will  be  able  to  make  conscious  exosomatosis  at  first  and  later  
Self-conscious exosomatosis or expansion of your consciousness. You 
must become the master of exosomatosis, the master of the Caduceus 
of Hermes Trismegistus.” 
He smiled and added, “Look up in the sky, there are so many, many 
stars that are in need of governors. The stars cannot come to you, but 
you can go to the stars - and even beyond! You will enter into the joy 
of our Lord, into the ‘Bridal Chamber,’ into Creation. The following 
hymn  of  the  Church  is  very  indicative  of  this  sacred  moment:  ‘Thy 
bridal chamber I see adorned, O my Saviour, and I have no wedding 
garment so that I may enter. O Giver of Light, enlighten the vesture of 
my soul, and save me.’
Through careful observation you will perceive that the centres on 
the etheric double of the material body appear as discs, while on the 
psycho-noetical levels we see them as spheres. This is according to the 
function and the work they have undertaken.
Visualising them on our bodies as discs, for example on the solar 
plexus,  the  heart  centre,  the  head  centre  or  on  any  other  centre,  the  
movement  of  the  disc  should  be  clockwise,  signifying  good  health.  
When the disc is moving counter-clockwise, this shows bad health. On 
the psycho-noetical level we see the centres as spheres. We see the disc 
dividing the sphere vertically into two hemispheres. The one hemisphere 
is in front of the disc and the other hemisphere is on the back of the disc.

271
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
The  centres  serve  several  functions.  They  control  the  flow  and  
quality of Etheric Vitality, which is necessary for the health and the 
well-being of our bodies.
The  etheric  doubles  also  act  as  connecting  links  between  the  
material,  psychical  and  noetical  bodies.  Receiving  light  from  Mind  
Super-Substance, they channel it as thought and emotion. The etheric 
doubles are the gates through which the elementals are projected and 
received by the personality. Elementals are stored within the centres 
and affect the character of the personality for better or for worse. As 
many of these centres play a vital role in our physical and psychological 
health, we must approach them with the utmost care and respect. This 
matter is not a pass-time toy to play with. However, if we approach 
them unwisely, we will have to pay the consequences of our actions. 
The Holy Archangels ceaselessly work in these centres. And They 
are most pleased to teach us more about Themselves, when we reach a 
certain level of awareness. We must however first become masters of 
the elementals we create or revitalise. 
Within our etheric doubles, Life-Energy exists in four states.  We   
have imprinting ether, aesthetic ether, kinetic ether and creative ether. 
So,  we  have  four  states  on  the  etheric  double  and  three  in  the  
material  body.  Four  ethereal  and  three  material,  comprising  seven 
states in total. Imprinting ether is used to shape Etheric Vitality into 
psycho-noetical images and is vital for our work in visualisation. 
Let us take a typical example: Energy resides in the etheric double. 
If I want to create a ball of light, I must use the imprinting ether and 
through visualisation give the light a particular form. I must visualise 
and mentally see the light forming a spherical shape. You may wonder, 
‘Why give it a form?’ Because one of the Laws governing the Material 
World is that, ‘Nothing can exist on the material plane without having 
a form.’ It is a Law, and we cannot change the Law!
From  the  formless  Mind  Super-Substance,  deriving  from  the  
World of Ideas, Laws and Causes, something can come into existence 
on the material level, provided it bears a form. Talking about balls of 
light, we can observe another Law. If we throw a stone in a lake, we 
will see that the water takes on a spherical shape. I also want you to 
consider our Permanent Atom.

272
The  aesthetic  ether  is  the  feeling  giving  ether.  Through  it  we  
experience  the  sensation  of  power,  pleasure,  pain,  cold  and  so  on.  
When we create a ball of light, we must also place in it the aesthetic 
ether  to  be  able  to  feel  it.  Within  the  material  and  psycho-noetical  
bodies  the  kinetic  ether  contains  different  patterns  of  motion  and  
movement.  If  we  want  to  send  a  ball  of  light,  how  can  we  do  that  
without using the kinetic ether? 
Now, we shall come to the most important ether, the creative ether. 
Creative ether is the prime ether and is under the care and authority of the 
Holy Spirit and the Holy Archangels. It is through the creative ether that 
our bodies, indeed all of them in total, are constructed and sustained.
In the distant past, Man misused creative ether. That is why the 
Holy Spirit does not allow us to use it fully, but only to make limited 
use of this ether. 
In time though and in accordance with our spiritual development, 
we  will  again  be  entrusted  with  all  our  Divine  Father’s  gifts.  When  
the  Holy  Spirit  and  the  Holy  Archangels  see  that  we  are  sincere  in  
our work, purifying our personalities and learning to consciously and 
Self-consciously use the ethers of all our bodies in our exercises and 
meditations, we will then reach the next stage, which is introspection. 
Through introspection we can learn to perceive the different rates of 
vibration, flowing between the material and the psychical bodies and 
between the psychical and the noetical bodies.”
My father’s voice echoes, “The noetical body belongs to the fifth 
dimension, even though it is in the material body. The psychical body 
belongs to the fourth dimension, but again it is in the material body 
and  the  material  body  belongs  to  the  third  dimension.  Now,  think!  
Is  it  possible  for  the  noetical  body,  which  is  in  the  fifth  dimension,  
to  concentrate  energy  in  the  three-dimensional  material  body?  Yes,  
through the act of thinking. Rays of Mind Super-Substance pass through 
the etheric double of the noetical body, affecting the material brain!”
He continues further explaining, “These rays of Mind substance, 
now pass through the etheric double of the psychical body and create 
an emotion, which again affects the material body!
The  material  body  is  in  the  three-dimensional  world,  with  its  
etheric  double.  Its  function  is  wholly  different.  The  etheric  doubles  
are also the connecting links between the bodies, between the material 
body, the psychical body and so on. 

273
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
The  psychical  body  with  its  etheric  double  is  in  the  four-
dimensional world; it is within us, not in our body. As I stated before, 
the  material  body  and  its  etheric  double  have  their  form,  and  the  
psychical body with its etheric double together with the lower noetical 
body with its etheric double have the exact same form. 
They  are  all  within  us.  The  psychical  body  with  its  etheric  
double  is  not  situated  at  a  specific  place  like  in  the  liver  or  in  the  
heart,  but  rather  is  within  us  in  the  four-dimensional  world.  We  
have the noetical body, the body of our thoughts, which is in the five-
dimensional  world  even  though  it  is  within  us.  Therefore,  we  have  
the material body with its etheric double, the psychical body with its 
etheric double, the lower noetical body with its etheric double, and we 
further have the higher noetical body, which is between the Worlds of 
Existence  and  the  World  of  BE-ingness,  of  the  I-ness.  Beyond  Mind  
Super-Substance, everything is formless and unbound by form.
Now,  let  us  ask  ourselves  the  question:  ‘How  do  we  use  our  
bodies?’ Concerning the noetical body, do we use the gift of thought 
and think in a reasonable way? What about the psychical body? Are we 
enslaved by our desires and wishes or do we express pure emotions? 
What about our actions? If we observe how people around us run their 
lives, we will notice that the majority misuse Mind Super-Substance 
- Energy. Depending on the disposition and interest of their present-
day  personality,  people  think  and  feel  according  to  the  impressions  
they receive from their surroundings. So while being here on Earth, it 
is important to realise the quality and kind of elementals our present-
day  personality  is  composed  of.  If  the  elementals  are  benign,  our  
present-day  personality  benefits.  However,  when  our  personality  is  
composed of negative elementals, we must be aware that we are bound 
to create psychical and physical illnesses that will torment our bodies. 
By  exercising  and  practicing,  we  will  also  observe  the  flow  of  
energy and train ourselves to only create or receive positive elementals. 
If by chance or by some mistake we should acquire or create negative 
elementals,  we  will  then  know  how  to  release  them  and  how  to  let  
them withdraw into the cosmic consciousness where they will remain 
inactive,  until  someone  else  shall  make  the  mistake  of  attracting  
and activating them again. So, that is how we can see the process of 
thinking and feeling; by the interaction between the dimensions and 
its effect on time and place living.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
274
Something that all of us should know, especially those who want 
to help others, is how to use elementals in healing.
Elementals can be constructive or dissolving but never destructive. 
My father used to emphasise: “This is another Law. When we gradually 
transcend  Mind-Energy  from  the  formless  Noetic  Super-Substance,  
to the Noetical substance, to the Psychical super-matter, to the Etheric 
substance-matter  and  finally  into  gross  matter,  and  pass  it  through  
a Form, then a ‘living form’ is created in the Worlds of Separateness. 
As a result, each ‘living form,’ irrespective of size, is composed of two 
components: Of a unique Archetypical Form relating to each type of 
‘living form’ and of matter. Always remember that a single Form gives 
existence  to  billions  of  similar  ‘living  forms’  (a  microbe,  a  cactus,  a  
cat, a mountain, a planet etc.) - and this is the Plurality of Absolute 
BE-ingness  in  manifestation!  Indeed,  every  single  ‘living  form’  is  
constituted  by  the  immortal-imperishable  Form  and  the  mortal-
perishable   (when   examined   from   our   three-dimensional   world)   
matter. Consequently, nobody can destroy the Form. That is the Law! 
In  reality,  we  cannot  destroy  anything.  We  can  only  separate  matter  
from the Archetypical Form by releasing matter, which is entrapped 
in a certain ‘living form,’ but we can neither destroy the Archetype nor 
the Principle of a Form, which is governed by the Circle of Possibility 
and Probabilities of this Form.
On the other hand, constructive elementals are essentially health-
restoring  elementals.  They  construct  by  attracting  and  transcending  
Mind-Energy  according  to  the  aforementioned  pattern,  and  thus  
help the Holy Archangels to induce healing in our bodies. When an 
elemental is destined to help, it initiates a productive healing process.”
“But what is necessary in order to build a constructive elemental?” 
He answered, “First it must have a form, whether it is just the word 
‘form’  or  the  form  of  the  idea  behind  it.  Most  people  are  unable  to  
see the elemental as a form. However, elementals obey a Law. Most 
people create negative elementals, which have an effect on their lives, 
but  remain  unseen  as  forms.  Sometimes,  I  wonder  why  God  won’t  
allow people to see what they create. Maybe if they could, they would 
not dare create such abominable forms.”
“Let us come back to the study of constructive elementals,” he said. 
“If you want the elemental to be constructive, the first thing you have 
to do is to place love, unconditional love, in it. From that moment on, 

275
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
the elemental comes into existence. Love is something existing. It is 
Mind in existence. So love, not the egoistic type stemming from your 
personality self but the type of impersonal love, is the first thing you 
put in such an elemental.”
Continuing he added, “For example, suppose that I want to help 
you. If the nature of your problem is such that I need to send you light, 
I must create and give a form to that elemental, let us say the form of 
a  sphere  and  place  in  it  impersonal  love!  I  will  not  say,  ‘I  send  this  
sphere of light to help you because I love you.’ If I do it in such a way, 
I will be doing nothing for your assistance. Such a relation is personal. 
For it to be constructive, it must be pure. 
I am telling you this because I want you to know that when you 
try to help your beloved ones, do not ever put any personal love in that 
elemental. 
Now, the second thing you must instill in a constructive elemental 
is  your  willpower.  Not  the  human  willpower,  characterised  by  
stubbornness,  but  the  expression  of  your  real  will;  that  shall  work.  
Now,  we  have  love,  pure  love  and  willpower.  Through  love  we  give  
it existence, and through our willpower we give it energy and power. 
And then there will be the proper moment to send it. It doesn’t matter 
if you want to send it far or near. Be sure that it will go! 
Having created an elemental as mentioned above, guide it on how 
to work properly. Do not let it be free to do whatever it wishes. You 
must  keep  it  under  your  control,  not  under  your  petty  personality’s  
control.  Be  positive  so  that  in  this  way  it  will  be  a  very  good  and  
faithful servant. 
What  will  happen  if  we  leave  it  under  the  control  of  our  petty  
personality? At the beginning we may see some results, but they are 
egoistic.  We  may  brag,  ‘Look,  what  I  did!’  showing  off  our  paltry  
personality.  This  way  leads  us  to  nothing,  but  leaves  us  with  the  
impression  that  we  have  accomplished  something.  So,  what  will  
happen to that elemental we created? It will lose its power, and become 
a negative one. Do you know why? Because the elemental we created, 
instead of serving us, we have now become its servants! We become 
the slave of the elemental we created. 
So, we must be very careful when we create something. We must 
create it consciously because we are dealing with holy substance. We 
must place in it pure impersonal love and willpower from our real Self, 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
276
not from our petty personality-self. If it comes from our personality, 
we may fall into a trap, especially if we are a weak personality.
In  giving  the  elemental  pure  impersonal  love  and  the  willpower  
of our real Self we are giving the elemental its existence, energy and 
power,  and  we  are  directing  it  consciously.  We  have  it  under  our  
control.  Only  under  these  terms  and  conditions  will  we  be  able  to  
experience  the  creative  ether  that  is  under  the  authority  of  the  Holy  
Spirit and the Holy Archangels, and which will be given to a certain 
degree also to us.
They will know that we will not misuse it. We will know where 
we are standing and what we are able to do to. As a personality we will 
feel it is a great honour to be a pure channel and to be in the service 
of humanity.”
Sanctifying our Temple
Close  your  eyes.  Breathe  deeply,  rhythmically,  comfortably  and  
consciously. Inhale through the nostrils and exhale through the mouth. 
You do not only inhale air but also Etheric Vitality, which is everywhere. 
The  air  goes  only  into  your  lungs.  While  you  exhale,  let  the  air  
go out of your body and keep the etheric energy in your body. While 
exhaling do not let the air completely leave your lungs.
Now, concentrate on your toes. Use the aesthetic ether to feel your 
toes. Now, use the kinetic ether to move gradually from your toes up to 
your knees. You use the kinetic ether as a vehicle to transfer yourself 
from your toes and come up to your knees. So, you have the aesthetic 
ether to feel and the kinetic ether to move from your knees and slowly 
come to your thighs.
Do not consider it as movement in your body because moving in 
your material body you will find obstacles, the organs. You move in 
the etheric double of your material body. It is pure energy and light. If 
you feel your feet and your thighs tingling, do not be afraid. It is the 
energy flowing and spreading in your body. 
Come up to your solar plexus and concentrate without any fear in 
this centre of Life. Now, apart from the kinetic ether and the aesthetic 

277
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
ether use the imprinting ether, which is another quality of the etheric 
double  of  your  material  body.  In  visualisation,  mentally  see  a  sky-
blue sun radiate from the solar plexus. Inhale the energy and light and 
while you exhale, keep the light and the energy in your body, let the 
air, all your doubts, fears and darkness go out of your body. 
Now, gradually come up to your chest, to your heart centre. Do not 
concentrate  on  your  material  heart,  feel  you  are  everywhere  in  your  
chest, but no concentration on your material heart should exist. You 
use again the aesthetic ether to feel you are in your chest. 
Now,  use  the  imprinting  ether  to  visualise  and  see  a  rosy  sun  
radiating from your heart centre. Through the kinetic ether, feel and 
see the radiation of the rosy sun, beaming out of your chest. Silence 
all emotions and desires and feel love in your heart, not the egoistic 
human love, but unconditional love, the Love of Christ. 
Christ-Love  is  given  to  you  freely,  without  asking  anything  
in  return.  Expand  this  rosy  light  and  cover  the  whole  planet,  your  
temporary home. As personalities we live on this planet, but as Spirit-
Souls, Immortal BE-ings, the planet lives in us. 
As  personalities  we  have  limits,  but  as  Spirit-Souls,  Immortal  
BE-ings, we are boundless. As a Spirit-Soul we hold the whole planet 
in us. Wish for peace on Earth as it is in the Heavens. 
Now, slowly come up to your head centre and say, “Thine is the 
Kingdom!” Once more, use visualisation and see a golden sun in and 
around your head. Clear your thoughts in this light. Have only creative 
thoughts in your mind. With your etheric eyes, look carefully at your 
material form. It is as if you are outside your body and studying it. 
Breathe deeply. Your body is a perfect temple of God, a great gift. It 
is yours to live in and it is yours to live through. See it translucent now.
With your etheric eyes you are able to observe its inner structure. 
Very,  very  slowly  examine  every  detail.  Starting  from  your  feet  
upwards.  See  the  skeleton  from  all  angles.  See  the  rich  network  of  
veins and arteries.
Study the rhythm of your heart, the blood flowing. Observe and 
admire  the  delicate  intricacy  of  the  nervous  system.  Now,  turn  your  
attention  to  the  organs.  See  your  liver.  See  your  spleen.  Observe  the  
stomach and your kidneys. If any organ or any part of your body is 
weak or distressed, breathe deeply and visualize it flooded in golden 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
278
light, the Christ-Light. See the light surrounding and penetrating that 
part of your body or organ. Visualize it absorbing all illness. See how 
the light absorbs all illness.
Now,  breathe  deeply  and  examine  your  lungs.  Observe  with  
every  breath  you  take  how  the  compartments  expand  and  contract.  
As fresh air is drawn in, your blood is not only fed with rich oxygen 
but  also  with  Etheric  Vitality.  The  liquids  moving  about  the  lungs  
emit  sparkling  light  in  a  vast  array  of  colours.  Now,  look  at  your  
heart. Breathe deeply and watch it pumping, sending blood through 
the entire body, producing more light, more life. Feel the love of the 
Archangel Michael and the warm red blood; how it easily circulates in 
your body. Now, slowly move up to your head.
As blood travels through the minute vessels, the brain shines in its 
own bright, clear light. Now, see your entire body. The etheric double 
is shining with sparkling Christ-Light, saturating the material body 
with Etheric Vitality. Visualise all atoms, molecules and cells glowing 
in radiant light. Light is everywhere, in all your bodies. In the heart 
it purifies desires and emotions, in the head it inspires understanding 
and clear thinking. This golden light dissolves all darkness, all distress 
and illness, leaving your temple clean and luminous. Now, use all the 
ethers  simultaneously.  Use  the  imprinting  ether  to  see,  the  aesthetic  
ether to feel and the kinetic ether to see the radiant light circulate. See 
them all at once and hold this picture of perfection in your mind. Thank 
the Holy Trinity and the Archangels for the magnificent gift of Life:
“Thank you, God, Absolute BE-ingness. My body is your temple. 
All my bodies are a gift from you. I will always keep them healthy. As 
a personality I will never lose faith in you. Even in times of great pain 
and despair I submit to your Will, Heavenly Father.
I  know  that  your  Breath  of  Life  is  always  in  me.  I  shall  love  the  
Lord,  my  God,  with  all  my  heart,  with  all  my  Soul  and  with  all  my  
mind. Thy Will be done.”
Breathe deeply. Feel yourself completely in your body. Keep this 
picture  of  perfection  always  in  your  mind.  Let  the  energy  flow  and  
spread gently everywhere in your body. Let it come slowly down from 
your head to your shoulders and chest, to your solar plexus and further 
down to your thighs and feet. Do not let it to go out of your feet. 
Now,  take  your  time  until  you  feel  that  you  have  completely  
returned in your material body.

Meditations – Poems
I 
live in a big building. My flat is on the last floor, the fifth. Almost 
every day, especially during summer time, I would often bring my 
father to my flat. We sat together outside on the veranda, to relax, have 
coffee and talk, and later to have dinner. Then, I would take him back 
to his home to sleep. 
On the first floor of the building, I owned a smaller flat. We had 
prepared it for Father to put his things there and have his time to work, 
write  his  books  and  rest.  In  this  way,  he  split  his  time  between  his  
home and this flat. 
While spending time and drinking coffee on the veranda, I used to 
ask my father to tell me stories about his life. That afternoon I asked 
him to tell me one of them, which had taken place long before he met 
and married my mother. 
He smiled and started. It was the time of the war. His father, my 
grandfather Panayiotis, wanted him to serve in the British army, just 
like  his  brothers  had  done.  Father  refused  to  go  and  said,  “Father  I  
want to save lives; not take them. God gave life to Human Beings, who 
am I to take their lives. Only God has the right to do that.”
My grandfather was upset, of course, and burst out. “What do you 
want  to  do  then;  stay  inactive?  This  is  a  shame  for  our  family.”  My  
father responded, “Of course not! I will go to the army, but I will serve 
in the hospital.” And this is what he did.
Father elaborated that at that time, an officer named Lieut. Colonel 
N.  N.  Hajra,  arrived  with  his  medical  team  at  the  Indian  Military  
Hospital,  in  Strovolos.  Surprisingly,  they  asked  my  father  to  join  
them. It seems that this officer was a very educated philosopher. 
They worked every day together helping wounded soldiers brought 
from ships from nearby countries. After a day’s hard work, the team 
would  stop  to  eat,  talk  and  then  rest.  Father  was  very  happy  to  be  
with them and hear the officer talk to him, explaining his own view 
on Indian philosophy and life. My father showed earnest interest and 
studied the books the Colonel offered him.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
280
After  some  months,  my  father  decided  to  write  a  small  booklet,  
so that when the time was to come for the team to leave Cyprus, he 
would offer it as a gift to the officer. 
Father  explained  that  he  wanted  to  write  it  in  the  form  of  
meditation-poems, in return for the knowledge gained from the officer’s 
books. This collection was named ‘MEDITATIONS’ and it is an ode 
to ‘Desirelessness.’  It  vividly  addresses  the  many  faces  of  suffering  
and  spiritual  blindness  inflicted  upon  Human  Beings  throughout  
the centuries by the great demon of unbridled desire. Furthermore he 
suggests a remedy and a way, for Man to follow in order to set himself 
free of all his ailments and tribulations. I am sharing it with you in 
reverence of his memory, exactly as he gave it to me and without any 
editing.

Lieut. Colonel N. N. HAJRA,

THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
FOREWORD.
Some  philosophers  hold  that  “It  is  impossible  
to  destroy  unhappiness  unless  Desire  is  destroyed,  
insomuch as desire is the cause of Worldly Life; and 
it is the duty of everyone to destroy Desire.” But it is 
to  be  observed  that  Desireless  Action  is  the  sign  and  
result of distraction of Desire since (a) Abandonment 
of Action is totally unnecessary for destroying Desire, 
or  after  desire  has  been  destroyed,  and  (b)  The  fact  
whether  Desire  has  been  destroyed  or  not,  can  be  
proved  by  nothing  so  well  as  by  Actions  performed  
desirelessly for the 
benefit of others. 
Desirelessness   of   Mind   is   the   true   sort   of   
Proper  Behaviour  and  Morality  and  not  the  
literal 
abandonment of Actions.

I.
PAIN in all forms and cry,
Is what one finds under the sky.
Since the moment of one’s birth, 
Until the time of one’s death.
Illness and Pain, Joy and Fight,
From early morning until night.
Joy is like a passing cloud
In strong wind, in storm of Pain.
It cannot lure and make proud 
One who knows it, who is sane.
II.
Desire is the only cause of suffering and pain,
When it holds the eye of the Soul- the brain.
From the instant one is born,
DESIRE, the devil, watching near
Will catch one and one will moan
For one’s mother. Mother dear.
In childhood there is no rest.
Until the mother gives her breast,
Milk to quench the child’s thirst.
III.
Cries of pain, Sobbing and Tears
Is mostly what one sees and hears. 
In boyhood, stronger desire
To get an apple or a book 

285
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
Will make a boy a liar.
The boy victim in desire’s hook.
As a Man, one fights to exist,
One hates, suspects and steals
Living in dark Ignorance’s mist
One one’s fellowmen kills. 
So many wars, mischief and dead,
Why? For what? For one’s bread. 
I V.
As human beings, we suffer and toil,
And at the end a grave lies.
We die and decay under the soil.
Struggles in vain. The struggler 
dies.
Where we have been before our birth?
When life ends, where we go?
One’s short life in a body of earth 
To ETERNITY, all of us know,
Is beyond perception and description. 
At present all we know is fiction.
 
V.
TIME
What is time? One may ask,
Hard question, and the reply 
To give is hard and great task 
And even then, it will be a lie.

VI.
On a planet all of us live
Speedily moving among the stars,
But even that we cannot perceive.
We little know of Saturn or Mars.
The surface only of the planet Earth,
Sometimes warm, sometimes cold,
Is all we know until our death.
A Three Dimensional World.*
 
VII.
Matter and form is an illusion 
Which leads, the Spirit to confusion. 
The body changes and will die. 
The body is 
“mine” and not “I”.
But what is I? The Real I, 
Who lives in a human form,
Who sees matter through the eye
Who feels, hears and can transform
The food in stomach into blood
Who feels at times sad or glad? 
“I” is not one’s Fleshy Frame.
Bones, flesh and blood is only matter.
I am, have been and will be the same, 
When time my form will scatter.

Fools  disregard  me  when  a  human  form  I  assume,  not  
knowing  my  higher  nature  as  the  Supreme  Lord  of  all  beings.

That “I,” the dweller is DIVINE*
Will leave the matter very short,
Will leave illusion in form of “mine”
And be one with the Great Lord, 
If all desire’s fetters breaks.

Desire to possess is the only cause 
Of all sufferings and pain,
Of fight and murder and the source
Of all evil with no gain.
Form and matter, what a shame,
Is what we care for and fight.
We all neglect the HOLY FLAME 
Which is within us and in night
Of ignorance and horror, we live 
Until this earthly home we leave.
But where one goes when one dies?
To inexistence? To damnation? 
Both ideas are stupid lies 
The only Truth is SALVATION.

To Salvation, quickly or slowly, 
Who speaks of punishment is liar,
But Salvation is attained only 
When one destroys all Desire.

A monstrous Deity does not exist 
Who the poor sinners punishes,
Who keeps for the good and bad a list
And rewards or to hell banishes. 
But Hell and Paradise still exist.
One makes one’s self Angel or beast.

Know thyself is the main thing
Which on Earth one should learn
And not ways and means to think 
For earthly wealth to earn.
The earthly things one will leave 
Behind, when Death will call.

Will be a Suffering Soul.

When life ends here on earth.
The very same world which helps 
One to gather in life wealth.

But there, now the passions stronger 
Without hope to buy or sell 
Actions and business, as now, no longer.

Created and one, only, feels
And will suffer there lonely,
Until one’s passions one kills.

and anger, they strive to gain heaps of wealth by unjust means for the 
gratification of their passion.

into loathsome hell. Bhagavad Gita. Sharma.

Such as the law of effect and cause,

THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
NOTES.
It  is  very  difficult  to  find  any  person,  not  being  an  Occultist,  
who  has  a  true  knowledge  of  the  worlds  different  to  the  three-
dimensional,  the  world  known  as  Physical.  All  Religions  teach  
the  after  death  Life,  the  Religious  man  believes  blindly  to  the  
existence of some other World, but only the Occultist has the true 
knowledge  of  this  World  because  only  the  Occultist  can  bring  
his consciousness in accord with the rate of the vibrations of this 
World.  To  an  Occultist  this  World  is  as  familiar  and  real  as  the  
Physical; he can visit it, when he likes, live there and be in touch 
with its inhabitants, either human who left the material body (the 
dead),  or  other  beings  of  that  world,  non-human.  That  world  is  
not  far  from  us,  although  it  is  true  that  in  the  four-dimensional  
World,  time  and  distance  do  not  exist  as  in  the  Physical  World.  
Our dear dead are very near us, but we cannot see them because 
our physical eye cannot impress on our brain any other vibrations 
except those produced by three-dimensional things. The physical 
eye cannot see even the air, the effects of which everyone sees and 
feels, but because we do not see the air, it does not mean that the 
air does not exist.
Now, an explanation on the various Dimensions is necessary: 
A  Point  (.)  has  position,  but  not  magnitude  and  has  no  
dimensions
A Line (-----) has one dimension, (length)
A Surface has two dimensions, (length and breadth) 
A Solid has three dimensions (length, breadth and thickness)
Four-dimensional    objects    cannot    be    seen    unless    the    
consciousness  is  transferred  from  the  physical  body,  (three-
dimensional)  to  the  four-dimensional  human  astral  body,  as  
Occultists call it.
In  the  four-dimensional  World,  (Emotional  or  Astral  as  it  is  
called) a human being is living, but unconsciously, even while he 
lives in the material body, and continually creates unconsciously 
four-dimensional   creatures   (thought-forms),   which   have   an   
unceasing influence, pleasant or unpleasant which depends upon 
the nature of the thought which brought them to life, on him or on 
his fellowmen.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
292
The  Occultist  only  can,  consciously,  give  long-term  life  and  
keep under his control such creatures, which in this case are most 
powerful, not only in the Astral World but also over matter. 
Some Occultists create such creatures to serve personal interests, 
the result of low passions, (black magic), but happily they are very 
few and not very powerful, while other Occultists are using these 
thought-forms as all other powers entrusted to them by the Great 
Self, strictly for the Real good of others (white magic).
After  the  death  of  the  physical  body  a  man  lives  enveloped  
in his Passions tormented by the monsters (ugly-looking thought-
forms)  created  by  him  or  those  he  injured,  while  the  good  and  
religious  man  there  worships  his  religion’s  Deity,  greatly  helped  
by the pleasant thought-forms of those he loved and helped in life. 
Both of them there, in the Astral World will live, the one suffering 
and the other one happy until the time they will give up every desire 
good or evil. Then, they enter another World of other dimensions.
There  are  Worlds  still  of  more  dimensions:  The  World  of  
perfect  Peace  and  Union  with  the  Great  Being,  where  Light  is  in  
the form of Truth coming not from a material Sun, but from the 
Great Lord.

Sacred Encounters from the Past
T
HE  following  story  depicts  in  detail  the  circumstances  under  
which my father came to meet with Colonel Hajra. It is an exact 
transcription  of  his  own  narration,  so  the  following  is  according  to  
Daskalos’ exact wording, speaking in the first person:
“It was just after World War II had commenced. I was lying on my 
bed and it started raining. The Master, Father Yiohannan, next to me 
suddenly interjected, ‘Well, today you are going to meet with people 
of  your  former  race.’  ‘Yes,  but  I  am  planning  to  go  to  the  cinema,’  I  
responded. ‘You are not going to the cinema. Get started, but you are 
not going to the cinema,’ Yiohannan commented. Ignoring his words, 
I put on my coat and headed for ‘Magic Palace,’ a most notable cinema 
and  theatre  hall  300  yards  from  our  house  in  Pantheon  street,  in  
Nicosia. Upon coming out of my house I spotted in the adjacent park 
an open type military lorry. Two Indian soldiers covered with blankets 
were sitting in the back, whereas the driver and another fellow were 
in  the  front.  There  was  some  tension  in  the  air;  it  seemed  that  they  
were lost. Then, the driver addressed me in the Indian language, and 
smiling inwardly I answered back, also in the Indian language. This 
alleviated their tension, and thus being more relaxed they soon started 
chattering,  babbling  in  Indian.  Hence,  I  invited  them  to  my  nearby  
house saying, ‘Get on brothers let’s go to my home.’
So,  we  all  headed  to  my  house,  which  was  very  near.  When  we  
arrived,  my  mother  welcomed  us,  and  they  continued  to  converse  
endlessly  in  Indian.  The  Master  inside  me  was  doing  most  of  the  
translation for me, and I kept on answering back in flawless Indian. 
My mother astounded made a witty comment, ‘God knows what else 
we are going to hear and see...’
I  asked  her  to  hand  me  the  hot  iron,  so  that  we  would  dry-up  
their wet blanket and shirts. In the mean time, my mother prepared 
a  hot  chicken  soup,  and  all  ate  with  great  appetite.  Needless  to  say  
that all dialogues were conducted in Indian. At some stage, my father 
accompanied  by  a  British  Lieutenant  General  or  rather  a  General,  
entered  the  room.  To  his  astonishment  he  saw  them  and  overheard  
that we were talking in Indian. ‘Sir,’ I said, ‘they have lost their way.’

Sometime later, they were asked to present their documents and 
credentials. The General took over and stated that he was going to send 
for a vehicle from the Indian Military Hospital, which was situated at 
the time at the English School premises, in Strovolos, a nearby suburb 
of Nicosia.
After  sorting  out  the  whole  issue,  the  General  turned  to  me  
and  exclaimed,  ‘I  spent  ten  whole  years  in  India  and  didn’t  manage  
to  learn  the  Indian  language,  except  for  a  few  words;  how  did  you  
manage to learn and speak all that Indian?’ ‘I am afraid I cannot give 
you an explanation; these matters are not amenable to explanation,’ I 
answered back gently.
My father interposed in frustration, saying to the General, ‘If he 
doesn’t manage to drive us mad, no one will be able to do so. Armenians 
come  and  he  speaks  in  Armenian,  Indians  arrive  and  he  converses  
in  the  Indian  language.’  Then,  without  exercising  any  courtesy  and  
discretion, he unduly elaborated on my long-standing ability to read 
and write in Sanskrit. I cannot understand my father... 
Meanwhile,  after  the  soldiers  had  departed,  some  25  to  28  days  
had elapsed uneventfully. At that time, I was working as a volunteer 
in the General Hospital, I also had a military rank. Then one day, the 
Master (Father Yiohannan) announced to me out of the blue: ‘Today, 
you are going indeed to meet with your brothers, and you will have to 
spend a lot of time as well, because you will have to serve. You have to 
go to the English school, so get up, get dressed and move on.’ I obeyed 
without hesitation and headed on foot for the English School, which 
was a mile away.
Upon  arriving  at  the  gate,  I  spotted  two  towering  huge  Indian  
guards,  holding  long  spears  and  sten  machine  guns  (British  made  
automatic  assault  guns)  were  hanging  from  their  shoulders.  For  a  
moment  I  hesitated  and  stepped  back,  lest  they  exercise  violence  on  
me, but Yiohannan urged me to proceed forth, ‘Why are you retreating, 
Colonel Hajra is waiting for you.’ He even named the person, whom I 
was supposed to meet! ‘But then, Master if there is a mistake?’ I replied. 
‘There is no mistake at all,’ he said in an assuring and unquestionable 
manner.
Therefore,  half  heartedly  I  advanced  towards  the  guards,  who  
on  the  spot  crossed  their  spears  in  front  of  me,  cutting  off  my  way.  
Without delay, I repeated the exact phrasing Father Yiohannan urged 

295
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
me  to  expel:  ‘Colonel  Hajra  Chaim  (I  want  to  see  Colonel  Hajra).  
Colonel Hajra Chaim!’
Instantly,  one  of  the  soldiers  replied  in  a  stern  voice,  ‘Yes  Sir,  
please  sit  down.’  He  then  made  an  internal  phone  call,  and  soon  a  
military man on a motorcycle arrived at the gate, stating that ‘Colonel 
Hajra is waiting for you.’ It was my turn to go crazy...
I followed the newcomer and we headed up-hill to the rooms of the 
Colonel at a slow pace. The man, who proved to be his secretary guided 
me into the Colonel’s office. The door was open, but nevertheless I still 
knocked on it. Apparently, he was waiting for me, for he welcomed me 
in perfect Greek, ‘Come in, I am expecting you.’ I stepped in and said 
in amazement, ‘Colonel, you can speak Greek?’
‘Whatever  you  know,  I  also  know  now.  It  is  of  no  significance  
that until a moment ago, I did not speak any Greek.’ Seeing that I was 
still astonished he continued in Greek, ‘Soon you are not going to be 
surprised with things like this, but others are going to be amazed with 
what you are going to perform. Well listen, for the time being take a 
shower  and  put  on  a  clean  uniform,  which  we  are  going  to  provide  
you with, and then let us proceed downstairs to have lunch.’
I went to an adjacent building and acted according to his directions. 
Upon  my  return  to  his  office,  he  extended  his  lunch  invitation  once  
more and concluded, ‘After lunch with all the other British and Indian 
personnel, I will take you personally back home with my car. As from 
tomorrow morning, my jeep will be taking you to the Military Hospital. 
Now, we speak in Greek but bear in mind that as from tomorrow we 
won’t be talking anymore in the Greek language.’ ‘Of course sir, since 
you  and  I  are  so  keen  on  the  English  language,’  I  exclaimed.  ‘Not  at  
all,  from  now  on  we  are  going  to  converse  in  the  Indian  language.  
For  this  purpose,  you  are  going  to  receive  lessons,  so  that  you  will  
remember again -but definitely not learn- the language you were once 
fluent  with.  I  am  sure  that  soon  you  will  be  able  to  speak  your  old  
language,’ he replied.
Therefore, as from the next morning my new duties commenced 
in the British Military Hospital, next to Colonel Hajra, who was the 
chief  doctor  and  surgeon.  Additionally,  I  was  properly  initiated  by  
him,  into  the  Indian  language  and  very  soon  everything  concerning  
the written and spoken word was gradually resurfacing from within 
me, into my contemporary memory. Within the first week, to the joy 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
296
of  my  mentor,  I  was  able  to  speak  fluently  the  Urdu  dialect  of  the  
Indian language, with the Indian personnel (without the assistance of 
Father  Yiohannan)!  And  although,  one  of  my  previous  incarnations  
had surfaced in all detail, still it was me and not another person.
One  day  Colonel  Hajra  mentioned  to  me  that  since  they  do  not  
have  a  ‘Lama-Priest’  they  themselves  undertook  the  holy  duty  of  
performing  the  sacred  religious  ceremonies  and  prayers.  Hence,  he  
invited me to participate, if that would please me. I accepted gladly. I 
was to merge with their communal life, without having the slightest 
impression that I was a stranger to them.
Three months elapsed, and one day Colonel Hajra appeared with 
an  announcement,  ‘Today,  I  reckon  that  a  brother  of  yours,  coming  
from  another  incarnation,  will  appear  to  you.  I  am  neither  going  to  
give you his name nor yours of that time. You are going to remember.’ 
‘Sure,’ I noted, without him giving me further information. Indeed, the 
individual appeared the same day, as predicted. While I was performing 
my duties preparing some medications, I sensed his presence behind 
me. He was also a doctor, and immediately I recollected that his name 
was Metkhov Ananda. My name at that time was Belatachi, meaning 
the  Servant  of  the  Angels.  On  the  other  hand,  Methkhov  Ananda  
stands for the Bliss or the Divine Joy of the Lord.
As soon as he sensed that I felt him, he called me, ‘Belatachi dear, 
come!’ and he offered me a glass full of lotuses. For the next 15 to 20 
days we worked together until Colonel Hajra announced to me, ‘We 
will proceed with the initiation; I hope that they accept you.’
At the feet of the mountain range of Pentadactylos, north of Nicosia 
there  is  a  site  called  Agyrta.  At  that  place  there  used  to  be  another  
Military Hospital. He told me to take a two-day leave, and when I did 
we headed to the site.
At a specific time, Colonel Hajra informed me, ‘We pray that you 
are going to be accepted. Once you were at a very high position. We 
hope that you will recover your position and be reinstated at as high 
an echelon as before.’
Afterwards,   the   attendants   prepared   me   for   the   initiation   
ceremony. My clothes were removed entirely, and my body was washed 
meticulously with a sponge impregnated into an aromatic water. The 
fragrance of the water was very intense and covered all my senses.

297
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
After this, I was asked to lie down naked on a marble table – the very 
one that was used for surgical operations. Immediately the attendants 
started tying me down on the table with ropes. The tying was so tight 
and complicated, that every part of my body was rendered immobile 
-from  the  forehead  to  the  toes  of  my  feet.  I  had  the  impression  that  
even if they wanted to untie me, this would have been an impossible 
task to achieve.
Next, they placed underneath the table three coal burning heaters 
(braziers) and threw hot water on them. Thick clouds of vapours and 
fumes emerged and surrounded me, rendering me totally invisible to 
the outer world. I stayed there dizzy and in a submissively receptive 
state.  The  only  thing  I  could  feel  was  the  repetitive  melody  of  a  
harpsichord, signaling a known Indian religious chant. Miraculously 
I felt a cool breeze or touch caressing my face, and soon after, all the 
ropes  and  knots  fell  on  the  ground  setting  me  completely  free!  The  
Indian brethren approached, dressed me with a white robe and put a 
golden belt around my waist – a symbol of exosomatosis. 
Of  course,  I  could  always  perform  out  of  body  travels,  but  
nonetheless,  ever  since  this  ability  became  more  systematic  and  
intense. Each incarnation has something new to add to the personality; 
it  gives  a  different  aspect  of  many  known  abilities.  Regarding  the  
process of initiation per se, as far as I am concerned, I recollect that 
although  I  was  always  initiated,  each  repetitive  initiation  signaled  a  
new  beginning  of  the  personality,  offering  nothing  to  the  soul,  but  
nevertheless  giving  the  sense  of  a  fresh  start  and  momentum  to  the  
personality towards its deeds.”

Guiding our Children in the Times to Come
S
ITTING by my father’s bed, while he was resting, I started thinking 
how  much  I  had  received  from  him.  I  was  unable  to  calculate.  
Teaching, knowledge, wisdom... What can I say about his behaviour 
towards  my  sister  and  myself.  I  took  a  paper  and  I  started  writing.  
Years later giving a seminar in Germany, some friends asked me how 
to guide their children. Upon this request I felt unprepared, but in a 
moment I pulled myself together and started my speech. 
“Sometimes  it  is  very  difficult  for  our  children  to  communicate  
with  us  and  vice  versa.  They  know  that  we  love  them,  that  we  care  
about them and that we want to help them. Nevertheless, at times we 
do not manage to show them that we are ready to hear what they want 
to communicate, instead of constantly lecturing them.
Every now and then their behaviour gives us grief, and we in turn 
hurt them with our words. At times they make us feel proud of them, 
but  occasionally  we  become  disappointed.  On  the  other  hand,  our  
children are sometimes proud of us and at other times disappointed 
with us, especially when we belittle them without noticing how bad it 
makes them feel to be underestimated. 
We must learn to communicate with them in the right way and at 
the proper time. We should express our emotions freely and we should 
not misuse the power we have over them. If we act appropriately, we 
will earn their respect.
In this way they can grow up protected and self-assured, and this 
will make us feel that we have fulfilled the aim of our life as parents.
Things to consider:
1. Stop  being  afraid  to  be  firm  with  your  children.  Clear  rules  
will make them feel more secure and confident.
2. Avoid  spoiling  your  children  by  fulfilling  all  their  desires.  
They want to check out how far they can go, while deep inside 
they are very well aware that they cannot have everything they 
want.

301
THE WAY, THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE
3. Avoid making them feel smaller than they are. This might lead 
them to play games with us, taking advantage of our care. In 
this way we will feed the egoism in them.
4. Avoid being too easy-going and liberal, as it might cause them 
to be disorganised. The result might be a constant attempt to 
escape from their duties.
5. Avoid   giving   excessive   attention   to   small   indispositions   
because children might utilise them to get your attention or to 
avoid duties.
6. Avoid  commenting  on  their  behaviour  continually.  Bear  in  
mind that they can learn better if you lead by example rather 
than by reprimand.
7. Avoid reprimanding them in front of other people. They will 
pay  more  attention  to  your  words  when  they  are  spoken  to  
calmly in a private atmosphere.
8. Avoid issuing orders incessantly. A friendly conversation can 
lead them to their duties more willingly.
9. Avoid shouting at them. They will be more attentive and less 
defensive to what you want to say when you speak calmly.
10. Avoid protecting them from the consequences of their actions. 
Sometimes, they should suffer in order to learn. 
11. Avoid  implanting  in  them  that  the  mistakes  they  make  are  
sins, because this will discourage them in all future actions.
12. Never lie to your children. It will be very painful for them to 
discover that their parents withheld the truth from them.
13. Never tell lies to others in front of your children because you 
make them an accomplice to your hypocrisy.
14. Avoid falling into contradiction. You confuse them incredibly 
and make them lose their faith in you.
15. Avoid trying to make your children believe that you are perfect 
or infallible. It will be a very unpleasant surprise when they 
discover that you are neither the one nor the other.
16. Always  remember  how  quickly  your  children  grow  up.  It  is  
very difficult for us to follow their steps, but we should try.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
302
17. Allow  your  children  to  do  whatever  they  need  to  do.  You  
should  give  them  the  chance  to  learn  by  themselves.  If  you  
do  everything  for  them,  how  can  they  obtain  the  feeling  of  
responsibility?
18. Always remember that your children cannot develop without 
your understanding and love.
19. Sometimes you may think that you give too little time to your 
children,  but  remember  that  what  counts  is  how  you  spend  
this time with them; qualitative time instead of quantitative.
20. Avoid making light-minded promises. You might not be able 
to keep them, and this might cause them to lose confidence in 
you. If you make a promise, never break it. You should aim at 
fulfilling it, otherwise your children might have the impression 
that you disrespect them.
21. You should be polite with your children if you want them to 
learn to be polite.
22. Always  remember  that  they  will  not  hold  you  in  low  esteem  
when   you   say   sorry   after   you   make   a   mistake.   If   you   
acknowledge your fault honestly, it will create more affection 
for you in them.
Some might say, “Well, Panayiota does not have any children in 
this life. How can she give this kind of advice?”
Smiling I reply, “I draw this knowledge from the way my parents 
guided me and from what springs from within me.” 
In  general,  it  is  very  important  that  we  teach  our  children  to  be  
happy  about  where  they  stand  now  and  to  be  optimistic  about  the  
future. Do not implant your own fears into them. Tell them that they 
are protected and that they should find their own guidance. 
A very crucial point is not to emphasise their bad behaviour or the 
things that displease us because in doing so, we will attract more of 
this kind of behaviour in our family life.
Instead,  we  must  practice  seeing  them  in  their  true  nature  as  a  
Soul-Self,  no  matter  how  their  personality  is  behaving  at  present.  
See them endowed with virtues and goodness, realising the purpose 
they  came  to  fulfill.  See  them  filled  with  light,  learning  the  lessons  
for  which  they  have  come  peacefully  and  patiently.  If  we  succeed  in  
holding this picture of our children, this is true upliftment!

More about Colour-Light
“I 
have already mentioned that we have sky-blue light in the centre 
of the solar plexus, rosy-white light in the heart centre and golden 
light in the head centre.
If  we  look  at  the  spectral  colours,  we  find  red,  orange,  yellow,  
green, blue and violet. When the vibrations of the colours are raised, 
they become more intense and their frequency is heightened.
Someone  may  think,  ‘How  does  the  vibration  of  our  centres  
differ  due  to  the  specific  colour-light  found  there?’  Of  course,  there  
are  different  vibrations,  since  there  is  one  colour  here  and  another  
colour there; and the most important thing for us is to know the effect 
colour-lights have on our centres. Great mystics have found out that 
the quality of a certain colour-light is necessary for us if we want to 
govern a specific centre.
Let us consider the qualities of the centre of the solar plexus and see 
why we need the sky-blue colour-light there. What qualities does this 
colour-light give to this centre? By attuning our Self to the sky-blue 
light of Archangel Gabriel we get to know the properties of this light, 
we become familiar with its vibrations and we come to understand it 
as a form of Archangelic life and expression. This ability leads us to 
perceive  the  nature,  the  complexity  and  the  importance  of  the  work  
undertaken in the centre of the solar plexus by the sky-blue light and 
its Ministers. Do you know what will happen if we add green colour 
to the centre of the solar plexus? We will create sex monsters because 
the use of this colour makes people react according to their instincts. 
People  who  do  exercises  using  the  green  colour-light  in  the  solar  
plexus, will create these undesirable conditions within them.
Mystics  have  discovered  what  exactly  is  needed  for  each  centre,  
so  that  each  centre  maintains  a  healthy  condition  and  people  are  
able to control it. All this serves our upliftment. So, we have to try to 
understand what qualities each centre has, and why a certain colour-
light is necessary for a particular centre. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
306
We  have  said  that  the  centre  of  the  solar  plexus  is  Life  in  the  
material body. The centre of the heart is the connection between the 
material body and the psychical body, and the centre in the head is the 
connection between the material, psychical and the noetical bodies.”
My father always asked me to take an interest in the quality of the 
colour-light. When I asked him if I should also be interested in the 
vibrations, he told me that I have to observe the degree and intensity 
of the vibrations when I use them for a certain purpose. We may need 
orange light, for example, to enrich the blood with Etheric Vitality. He 
went on...
“Mystics  have  revealed  that  these  colour-lights  are  not  dead  
colours, but living light that creates certain conditions. They saw that 
if we use a different light in a specific centre, it will create disharmony 
there, no matter how beautifully we envision this light. The important 
thing is not the colours in themselves, but where we place them and 
what  effect  we  want  to  achieve.  The  colour-lights  can  only  give  us  
what we want if we know how to work with them.
What is the vibrational difference between the yellow colour-light 
and the red colour-light? Why does one centre accept it and another 
centre does not? Why does one centre need it and yet another does not? 
We are wasting our time when we study the influence of the vibrations 
in this way, because we have already studied their effects and we have 
seen how they combine and work together. Therefore, we should not 
care about additional details.
Let us consider an example:
If we play the notes Do-Re-Mi on the piano separately, it gives us 
harmony. But if we pound out Do-Re-Mi simultaneously, disharmony 
will  result.  Are  they  not  all  frequencies  of  vibrations?  Can  we  know  
why disharmony is created? It depends on how we play it. That is the 
nature of things; it all depends on the vibrations we activate.
Another  example:  We  send  a  sphere  of  violet  colour-light  to  
someone. What a beautiful colour! It gives us depth and many other 
gifts but it may also cause a person’s death!

307
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
If we send ultra-violet or infrared colour-light to someone, do you 
know what will happen? We will drive this person crazy, and if he or 
she  suffers  from  high  blood  pressure,  it  will  be  fatal.  If  we  send  the  
same colour-light to someone with low blood pressure, it will help.
If  someone’s  nervous  system  is  quite  weak,  we  have  to  create  a  
sphere  that  has  a  very  clear  green  colour-light  on  the  circumference  
and a combination of colour-lights within, like the rainbow. Then, we 
have to place this sphere in the abdominal area. In the course of time, 
we  can  observe  how  the  nervous  system  of  that  person  will  become  
stronger.  However,  if  we  send  this  sphere  to  a  young  boy,  we  may  
cause him much harm.
We have to be very careful with what we do. Everything must be 
in the exact and correct place. We have to know what size the sphere 
must have, how to use it, where to send it and what the benefit will be.
We  have  to  exercise  a  lot  in  the  shaping  of  forms  by  utilising  
the correct colours in the appropriate size; so that when I ask you to 
visualise a green apple you will not start to visualise a watermelon.”

Dreams and Exosomatosis
A Lesson at Governor’s Beach
A
S I mentioned before, my father wanted one day of the week to be 
our free day. We chose Friday to be this day. He wanted to go to 
Governor’s Beach to relax and ‘recharge his batteries’ near the sea, as 
he used to say.
At that time, there were not so many houses or restaurants in this 
area. We used to go to a small place near the white rocks called ‘The 
Light House.’
Mr. Angelos was the owner. He was a refugee. He and his family 
came to this place when the Turkish troops invaded Cyprus in 1974 
and expelled one third of the island’s population from their homeland. 
Mr.  Angelos  was  very  happy  to  see  us  every  Friday  morning  at  his  
place, enjoying the breakfast he had prepared for us near the sea. He 
and his family did their best to fulfill our wishes. Friday’s breakfast 
was  the  most  delicious  of  the  week.  It  was  prepared  with  so  much  
love, and having it in front of the sea was exceptional.
After  breakfast,  my  father  liked  to  sit  in  his  comfortable  chair  
and listen to classical music, relax and take a brief nap. He used his 
headphones  in  order  not  to  bother  other  people  around.  Sometimes  
Mr. Angelos wanted to talk to him. He usually asked for my father’s 
advice on his problems or to be healed of his terrible back pain. Many 
times,  friends  or  students  came  with  us,  so  after  breakfast  he  often  
gave  us  a  lesson.  After  lunch,  he  slept  again  for  an  hour  and  then  
walked to the white rocks. In the afternoon, after coffee, we returned 
home.
That morning, I picked up my father from his home, at the usual 
time. Two students of his were with us. I was not in a good mood and 
Father observed that, but he did not comment on it at all. I was sure 
that when the students would go for a swim, he would ask me what 
the problem was. And so, when we were left alone, he turned to me 
and asked, “Yiota, what is bothering you?” I realised that he did not 
like to see by himself what my problem was, but he wanted me to tell 
him instead.

DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
“Father, I am confused with my dreams. Sometimes I have dreams 
and  I  realise  that  they  come  from  this  world.  Other  times,  I  know  
that  they  are  related  to  other  dimensions  and  so  I  try  to  distinguish  
in which dimension I am at that moment. Sometimes my dreams are 
coloured  and  sometimes  they  are  black  and  white.  There  are  times  I  
think that the dream tries to give me a warning, to tell me something, 
but I do not know what. Many times, I feel like I am visiting the future 
because what I see in the dream happens later in time, and I do not 
know how to handle the situation.”
He  smiled  and  asked  me  to  sit  near  him,  as  if  we  were  ready  to  
share  secrets.  His  voice  was  so  sweet  and  this  made  me  feel  calmer.  
“Look my love,” he said, “at first, we must see and analyse what a dream 
is  because  there  are  different  kinds  of  dreams.  We  have  nightmares,  
unhealthy  conditions  of  the  subconscious,  symbolic  dreams  and  
prophetic  dreams  and,  as  one  might  say,  an  abstract  form  of  dream  
which  represents  Life  in  other  worlds.  Think  how  many  people  are  
living in a dream without realising that they are alert in these other 
worlds.
In daydreaming we do not see scenes like we do in a dream, but 
subconsciously  we  live  these  scenes  and  situations.  Let  me  give  an  
example: When we read a book, we get lost in the plot of the story, yet 
we can have conversations with others, absentmindedly or not, or we 
might think about the food boiling in the oven and mentally see it while 
reading the book. This means we can see the food subconsciously and 
the dream continues in our mind; so, we are moving with the dream. 
Each  moment  of  our  life  can  be  a  dream.  We  are  in  a  state  of  
dreaming when we bring up memories of the past and see them in the 
present because memory is also a form of dream. 
In dreams we find two conditions: We have consciousness and we 
have the Ego-Self being attached to a time and space-place condition. 
Nevertheless,  whatever  happens  in  the  present  is  also  a  time  and  
space-place  condition.  Experiencing  an  event  this  moment,  say  a  
discussion  or  a  quarrel,  is  also  a  dream.  You  wonder  why?  Because  
we enjoy what we call reality through such a dream; we are living this 
so-called reality through the images we see in our daily life, of course, 
but we do not associate it with a dream. Let me clarify my point here.

How  many  times  do  we  sit  down  to  have  dinner  and  remember  
how  we  had  that  same  food  in  a  hotel,  for  example?  In  an  instant,  
eating  the  food  connects  us  with  different  scenes  and  situations.  
Pleasant  images  of  our  experiences  in  that  hotel  may  arise,  we  see  
people we talked to or we start to remember unpleasant moments of 
our stay there. What does that mean? It indicates that every moment 
is interwoven with the dream we call memory.
Another form of dream is when we leave the consciousness of the 
waking  state  and  enter  the  Psychical  World.  Having  a  dream  there  
means that we are confined to our shell and we are dreaming in the 
Psychical World. This implies that we are not consciously living the 
scenes in the Psychical World as they really are, but rather we reside 
in  our  own  psychical  shell.  In  this  psychical  shell,  we  usually  have  
dreams about things we take an interest in. While the material body 
is sleeping, we see what we desire, what bothers us, or what makes us 
afraid. Yet we are in the real Psychical World and in our own psychical 
shell  simultaneously.  This  means  that  even  though  the  Psychical  
World around us is very beautiful, we do not focus on the space-place 
Idea  of  the  Psychical  World,  but  on  our  shell,  and  we  dream  about  
whatever is of interest to us as a personality.”
“So  to  take  the  matter  further,  how  does  this  dream  differ  from  
the dream we are in, while being in a state of exosomatosis?” I asked.
“The difference to the previous condition is that, if we are in a state 
of exosomatosis we are dreaming without consciously seeing images 
in front of us. Let me give you an example. When we read a book, we 
mentally or abstractly see oceans, heroic actions etc. We enter into the 
meaning  of  the  story,  but  we  do  not  easily  see  images.  We  must  be  
very  strong  at  visualisation  if  we  simultaneously  want  to  see  events  
or  scenes  such  as  the  small  islands  that  are  described  in  the  book.  
Consequently,  we  need  a  certain  degree  of  ability  in  visualisation.  
When we read a book, our ability to visualise makes us live what we 
are reading more intensely and more beautifully.” 
“What if the book is about a shipwreck? How do we see that?” I 
enquired.
“By vaguely thinking about it, we perceive an overall idea of the 
shipwreck.  Yet,  if  we  were  dreaming,  we  would  be  able  to  see  clear  
images of this event.”

311
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
“And why can we see these images?” I asked.
“We receive impressions from without in a different way. In our 
own Psychical World, we see from within outwards. And this outward 
is within us again. That means we see from within us; consciousness 
opens  from  within.  And  what  we  see  through  outside  impressions,  
meaning  what  is  separated  from  us,  is  seen  from  all  sides,  yet  it  is  
within  us  while  it  gives  us  the  impression  of  being  on  the  outside!  
Therefore,  we  can  see  and  concentrate  more  fully  on  the  Psychical  
World.
Now,  suppose  we  are  sleeping  and  we  have  a  vivid  dream.  
Everything we see is within us. But who is visualising? Visualisation 
is done automatically. 
We  can  say  that  a  big  effort  is  needed  to  visualise  while  being  
awake  or  alert  in  the  Psychical  World  because  we  are  continuously  
focusing outwards, towards the objects outside in space-place. 
When  we  turn  within,  visualisation  is  much  easier.  Everything  
is done automatically, almost by itself. This is the reason why in our 
dreams we see beautiful places full of colours. Maybe we form these 
in our Psychical World, which means we can call them elementals.”
“Father, can we say that we are the personality-self at that moment?” 
“Yes,  because  when  Panayiota  sees,  she  thinks  that  Panayiota  is  
the one who sees, while it is the personality self-aware Self that sees. 
Thus, we can see elementals automatically in the course of things in 
the  Psychical  World;  not  requiring  as  much  ability  in  visualisation  
as would be required when we visualise through the material brain, 
where  we  see  and  understand  things  as  something  outside  us  even  
though  they  are  within.  Additionally,  we  can  see  conditions  in  the  
Psychical World, which have not been created by us.”
“How can we distinguish whether we live consciously in the real 
Psychical World or in our own psychical shell-world?” I enquired.
“This  is  very  difficult  because  if  we  are  not  advanced,  we  will  
start  to  see  something  and  connect  it  with  something  else,  and  that  
something  else  with  another  something  and  so  on.  Precisely  here  is  
the instance when we should use our ability to separate things. When 
we sleep, a dream may begin and we may see a beautiful scene in the 
Psychical World. This can lead us on to something known that we saw 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
312
in the Material World and we might confuse things. Then, we move 
on  and  see  another  scene,  which  leads  to  something  else  we  saw  in  
the Material World. In this way, the chaos we sometimes experience 
in dreams is created. Upon returning in the morning, we put together 
the pieces of our dream in the material brain, and we say that we saw 
this dream with these events and scenes.” 
“From which centre do we have a dream?” I asked.
“We can see a dream from many centres. From the centre of the 
present-day  personality  self-awareness,  or  from  the  centre  of  the  
I-ness  or  the  Permanent  Personality,  or  from  an  even  deeper  state,  
feeling as an I-ness only.” 
“With what organs do we see since our eyes are closed?”
“We  see  and  feel  with  our  consciousness  and  with  our  self-
awareness,  both  of  which  are  represented  by  two  different  centres.  
When we say consciousness, we mean our ability to orientate ourselves 
and to get impressions without paying attention to our self-awareness. 
This  is  what  happens  during  an  ordinary  dream  in  the  Psychical  
World, and what we see there is perceived in an abstract way.
Through our self-awareness, we can act in our dream in the same 
way  we  can  act  when  we  are  in  our  material  body.  Even  though  we  
find  ourselves  in  the  same  substance-matter,  we  cannot  live  all  the  
conditions of the dream, all the living noetical and psychical images 
in that environment.”
“How  can  we  separate  things;  by  continuous  and  systematic  
exercise?”
“Yes,  through  practice  we  can  see  more  intense  vivid  dreams.  
When  we  dream  in  the  Psychical  World  and  see  living  images  or  
scenes  that  make  us  vibrate  psychically  (for  example  rivers,  trees,  
hotels  and  the  sea)  we  perceive  these  things  as  real  Life.  When  we  
see things consciously, we accept them as fact without thinking about 
them. We see things as they are.”
“Can we exercise our willpower and thought in a dream?”
“If we cannot do it, this is exactly what we need to practice. We 
should exercise our willpower and our thought. If we accept everything 
in a passive way and see things without being able to change anything, 
and without wanting to understand anything, is this not an ordinary 

313
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
dream? It doesn’t matter how vivid this dream is or how beautiful the 
colours in it are. 
Now,  we  acquire  another  ability  which  is  to  express  our  will.  
When we live consciously in the dream, we want to change things, we 
want to change direction, we want to fly, but we know where we are 
going. We do not drift here and there like a kite that is swept away by 
the psycho-noetical currents. We perceive this state also as a dream, 
but it is unconscious exosomatosis.”
“Is it difficult to develop our willpower?”
“Of course it is.”
“Are there dreams where we can change what is happening?” 
“Yes,  but  we  cannot  call  this  a  dream,  but  rather  conscious  
exosomatosis with all its aptitudes and abilities. Henceforth, we are 
free. We live and express ourselves as will.” 
“Sometimes we want to change certain things in a dream and we 
feel that we are not completely asleep, yet we cannot do it. We do not 
know what we should do.”
“This is because we are at the midway point of a conscious dream, 
and that moment our self-awareness begins to awaken. Self-awareness 
is our ability to intervene in the dream. We should do many exercises 
to  achieve  this  state.  At  the  time  we  are  going  to  sleep,  we  should  
suggest to ourselves that we will leave our material body and see this 
dream consciously. If we do not bridge the gap between consciousness 
and self-awareness, and of course between the various types of ether, 
we cannot perform conscious exosomatosis. This is exactly the key to 
conscious exosomatosis.”
He looked at me as he wanted to see if I was comprehending his 
words.  He  wanted  to  make  sure  that  I  would  integrate  the  teaching  
into my experiences, and so he continued.
“What is exosomatosis? What do we mean by exosomatosis? One 
form of exosomatosis is to leave the material body as a present-day 
personality self-awareness and being conscious or self-aware, to see 
psycho-noetical scenes and yet to feel that we are we as a person with 
a  certain  shape  or  volume,  even  though  at  that  moment  we  are  of  
psychical super-matter. We are moving in the dream.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
314
If we are a developed seeker of the Truth, we can project and expand 
as  Consciousness  and  Self-awareness  and  include  within  us  a  large  
space.  This  new  perspective  that  we  acquire  as  we  spread  outwards,  
paradoxically is also conceived within us again. Seen from the point 
of view of the material body, we are spread out and moving outwardly, 
but in reality this always occurs within ourselves, within us. 
Is this now exosomatosis or not? I want you to think. Concerning 
the material body, we consider it as exosomatosis. But it is not. Why? 
Because the psychical body is bigger than the material body, and we 
are  moving  in  it,  but  we  are  also  moving  in  the  material  body  and  
outside of it.
When  are  we  dreaming  more  clearly,  during  exosomatosis  of  
both the material and psychical body, or during exosomatosis of the 
material body only, entering in a state we call consciousness? This is 
very difficult to understand. It is easy to say, but difficult to experience.”
“Can we understand it later?”
“In the beginning it is difficult to understand, but in the course of 
time, through continuous exercise we can learn to control things. It is 
a matter of training.” 
“What exercises can we do for that?”
“We can occupy ourselves with this matter to discover more and 
more things at the time we enter a dream. As we said before, we are 
presently at a midway state in a dream. Let me give you an example. 
Let us say you are getting up to walk, but you are swaying. Then, I will 
tell you that it is not enough to sway, but instead you need to learn to 
walk steadily. Now, you may ask how you can learn to walk steadily. 
And I will say, ‘First you should start to sway, and progressively you 
will begin to walk, like a little child.’
Now,  back  to  dreaming.  Maybe  we  can  have  a  dream  in  the  
Noetical World only. In the Noetical World we can see scenes, places, 
the progression of events, different things. What we usually do in the 
Noetical  World  is  to  think  and  to  determine  things.  When  we  have  
ideas,  great  ideas,  great  knowledge,  as  in  mathematics  for  instance,  
these come from the Higher Noetical World.
Let  me  give  you  another  example:  We  are  in  exosomatosis  and  
we have a question concerning mathematics. First we should work in 
the Psychical World. Is that a dream? I cannot say that it is a dream, 

315
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
but  rather  conscious  Life  in  the  psychical  planes.  Everything  will  
pass  through  the  procedure  we  call  a  dream,  and  dreaming  means  
that  I  see.  How  is  that  done?  Let  us  say  that  we  are  in  the  Psychical  
or Noetical World. How can the present-day personality be there and 
simultaneously exist here having its own thoughts? It is because the 
personality is living at the same time in all its bodies. Is our personality-
self not learning lessons abstractly? The personality changes, but it is 
not annihilated in the Higher Noetical World.”
“How does it change?” 
“In  the  higher  noetical  planes,  although  we  do  not  show  any  
interest in our name or our gender. This does not mean we are not the 
‘I-ness,’ the ‘I am I.’
The  Idea  of  Man  starts  to  get  its  form  in  the  Higher  Noetical  
World.  Consequently,  the  present-day  personality  self  is  built  from  
there on its descent. 
The  present-day  personality  of  Man  consists  of  the  material,  
psychical  and  noetical  bodies  with  their  etheric  counterparts.  If  we  
did  not  have  a  higher  noetical  body,  we  would  not  be  able  to  learn  
anything.”
“Is  it  possible  for  someone  to  learn  things  beyond  the  noetical  
level?”
“When  we  pass  from  the  Lower  Noetical  (Thought-forms)  to  
the  Higher  Noetical  (Concepts,  Meanings)  World  and  thereafter  
to  the  Noetic  World  and  beyond  (Ideas,  Laws,  Principles,  Causes,  
Archetypes), the personality does not care any longer about its name 
or gender, and thus being liberated from the bonds of the mundane is 
now eager to absorb Divine Knowledge.” 
“How are things that exist in the Noetic World expressed in the 
Material World?” 
“They are expressed as thoughts. Everything specific that has its 
own existence has its own character independent from the terms we 
use to describe it, which are only symbols. For example, water. Suppose 
we  see  water  in  a  glass.  An  Englishman  will  have  the  word  ‘Water’ 
in his mind, a Greek the word ‘Nero-Νερό,’ a German ‘Wasser’ and 
henceforth. Each one will say the word he knows for water, and will 
give the essence of it, which they accept and to which they co-vibrate 
as something known to them. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
316
Seeing water in the Higher Noetical or Noetic World, we do not 
need  to  say  ‘Water,’ ‘Nero’  or  ‘Wasser,’  we  simply  know  what  it  is.  
We know it through assimilation with the Idea or Concept of water. 
We do not apply anymore the mundane pattern of perception, where 
I am a centre called ‘I am I’ and that glass of water is something else. 
In the Higher Noetical and Noetic World, knowledge is complete, not 
lacking anything as when we receive it through the different levels of 
expression like words, interpretations, meanings or the many things 
we have in our subconscious like solid, liquid colourless and so on.”
“Can  we  say  that  Thought  and  the  Higher  and  Lower  Noetical  
World  are  the  connecting  link  between  the  etheric  counterparts  or  
doubles and the different worlds?”
“Exactly. The words of Joshua Immanuel the Christ still echo in 
our ears, ‘Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth 
and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but 
lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust 
doth  corrupt,  and  where  thieves  do  not  break  through  and  steal:  for  
where your treasure is, there will your heart be also’ (Matthew 6:19-21). 
What exactly is the meaning of this Great Truth?
It signifies that here on Earth nothing is ours because all material 
things can decay or be destroyed. Keeping treasures within us is more 
real.
To reach higher levels, we must change our attitude about earthly 
things. Let me employ two examples to help you to understand better: 
If we have a material object and give it to somebody else, we think we 
lose it, and what remains within us is its psycho-noetical counterpart. 
However, whatever we have within us psycho-noetically is multiplied, 
and no one can take it from us. We can share it with others and they 
can make it their own, but it is still fully within us. At higher levels, 
we can give and have simultaneously.
Again, If we give an unlit candle to someone, we lose it, but if we 
have  a  lit  candle,  we  can  take  it  and  light  thousands  of  candles,  for  
thousands  of  other  people.  Henceforth,  the  flame  of  our  candle  will  
not  be  lacking  anything.  Consequently,  when  we  give,  thought  and  
psycho-noetical images are multiplied; and others can work with and 
use them to improve their condition, without us losing anything. If we 
give something at a higher level, it does not mean that it is deprived 
from us, as it is in the Material World. 

317
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
To  continue  with  the  teaching  of  dreams,  we  should  separate  
dream  from  fantasy.  Nevertheless,  we  must  see  it  in  this  particular  
way: Does fantasy not play the leading part in our life? Of course it 
does, but we should separate things because fantasy is a condition of 
the present-day personality self-awareness, which is not perfect. We 
should overcome this imperfection.
We receive impressions from the world around us and, as I have 
said, we connect these conditions in us with the dreams we see. If we 
did not have this condition of seeing and understanding, we would not 
be able to obtain impressions from any world – material, psychical or 
noetical.  It  is  of  utmost  importance  for  us  to  concentrate.  We  have  
this ability in us; it is the second step after seeing and understanding. 
If  something  attracts  our  attention,  it  means  that  we  show  interest  
in  it.  Thus,  interest  is  the  means  by  which  the  flow  of  continuous  
impressions  is  facilitated  to  gain  entrance  into  our  conscious  and  
subconscious  mind,  and  where  it  will  be  transformed  into  coherent  
knowledge.
Let  us  say,  that  being  in  the  condition  of  alertness,  we  go  to  the  
market. Many things will come to our notice, but we will concentrate 
on  something  that  attracts  our  attention  more  than  other  things.  It  
is  as  if  we  transfer  impressions  to  our  subconscious,  and  then  we  
subsequently concentrate on them.
Whatever  attracts  our  attention  will  give  us  a  succession  of  
impressions. If we stop concentrating on these impressions because we 
are not interested in them, they will come and go like an imperceptible 
dream. Why do I speak of an imperceptible dream? Do you know how 
many thoughts are passing through our mind right now, that we are 
not aware of because we are concentrating on something else?
Everything we do and believe to be a reality is a dream.
Many  times,  I  have  repeated  to  you  that  reality  is  behind  the  
phenomena we perceive. Nevertheless, in the Worlds of Existence (the 
Material,  Psychical  and  Noetical  World),  most  people  usually  grasp  
these perceptible phenomena only superficially.
Therefore, we call these perceptible conditions a dream. Or we can 
call them memory if a few minutes or a few hours or even a day have 
passed. If we did not have the imprinting of impressions, which we 
call dream or memory, we would not remember anything.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
318
We would forget everything that has happened, and that would be 
as if nothing had existed. In daydreaming we can draw up something 
pleasant or something unpleasant. 
  We  need  to  be  impressed  by  something,  in  order  for  that  
something to be imprinted in our subconscious and from there it may 
reach the surface of our subconsciousness later. Then, if we draw into 
our memory events from the near or distant past and see them again 
mentally, this is called a dream. It can be daydreaming or memory. 
If our material body is sleeping and we bring things up from our 
subconscious, this may lead to an intense, vivid dream provided these 
things impress us. It can either become a pleasant dream if they are 
pleasant things, or it can turn into a nightmare if they were things that 
terrified us. We therefore face events in our life, which we believe to 
belong only to the Material World, while they might have their origin 
in the Psychical or Noetical Worlds.
Let  us  examine  the  Material  World,  our  everyday  life.  We  said  
that  in  our  everyday  life  we  use  the  ability  to  see,  to  understand,  to  
take  interest  in,  to  imprint,  and  to  possess  things.  In  order  to  have  
what? We cannot have anything from the outside. What we have as 
our property and what is real is the noetical image within us, not the 
reflexion of this noetical image outside in the Material World. 
If we deeply love something unconditionally and cherish it within 
us, it is absolutely ours. If someone takes this object from us, we still 
have  it  intensely  within  us,  and  it  is  still  ours.  This  is  no  longer  a  
dream, but something we want to preserve in us as a noetical image. 
For  example,  circumstances  lead  to  a  condition  where  we  live  apart  
from a beloved person. Still this person can be very close to us, even 
closer  than  before.  We  can  close  our  eyes,  connect  with  that  person  
and  by  attunement  and/or  by  ‘At-one-ment’  that  person  can  become  
part  of  us,  and  yet  later  we  can  again  return  to  ourselves,  without  
loosing our identity or individuality.
On  the  other  hand,  living  with  a  person  in  a  house  or  working  
together in a room does not automatically mean that we are close to 
this  person.  Indeed,  many  times  it  can  be  very  tiring  to  be  around  
someone.

319
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
Therefore,  what  is  ours  is  not  determined  by  the  distance  to  a  
thing or a person, but by the alignment of our vibrations to this thing 
or person and by our ability to use the Super-Substance we call ‘the 
Mind’ in order to shape Mind into forms, and thus make it our own 
property. Make it part of ourself or even our Self. 
What  we  call  love  plays  a  great  role,  and  we  must  distinguish  
between  wanting  and  loving,  between  wanting  this  thing  or  this  
person  and  loving  this  thing  or  this  person.  Wanting  and  desiring  
are also different levels of love, but the love we express towards other 
Human Beings should be on a higher level.”
He smiled again and said to me, “Is the problem solved now?” 
“Yes Father,” I reassured him softly. 
“Can we walk a bit before we return home?”
“Of course,” Father. We started walking, but I was drowned in my 
thoughts. I was wondering what I had done in my previous lives so as 
to deserve having a father like him. Suddenly, I heard his voice, “Yiota, 
where are you going?” I instantly came down to earth and looked at 
him. “We must go this way” he said and smiled. This time, I realised 
that he was reading my mind. “Wait, I am coming,” I said. 

320
What is our Goal here on Earth?
O
UR  home  resembled  a  monastery.  Apart  from  his  students  and  
friends, many people used to visit my father for healing purposes 
or because they sought help for their mundane problems. My mother 
used  to  run  around,  trying  to  offer  coffee  and  refreshments  to  the  
visitors. 
There were times I did not like that. I wanted my father for myself. 
Having so many questions to ask and wanting to discover everything 
from  a  father  when  I  was  absolutely  positive  that  he  knew  all  the  
answers, surpassed all my other needs.
One  evening,  when  all  of  our  visitors  had  left  our  house,  I  took  
a deep breath and said to myself, “Okay Yiota, now it is your turn.” 
Standing outside his study, I was wondering if he might be tired. But 
then, being thirteen years of age, I was sure I had more rights than the 
others. Therefore, I gathered up courage and knocked on his door. 
“Come in my love,” he said. I opened the door and entered. I was 
sure he knew what I wanted to ask, so I launched the question, “Do 
you  have  some  time  for  me  now?”  “Always  my  love.  I  have  time  for  
you always,” he instantly responded. The egoism of my age woke up 
making me think, “Yes, I know I have a special place in his heart.” 
Sitting near him I said, “I want to ask you so many questions.” He 
smiled as usual and replied, “You can ask me.” I took on my serious 
expression, as if I was one of his best students and started. 
“Why do we pay so much attention to introspection Father? What 
is our purpose?” 
He looked at me and replied. “Our main purpose is to know our 
present-day personality, to purify it and then to assimilate it with our 
real Self, the Permanent Personality.” I opened my mouth to ask, but 
he continued.
“What will our gain be? We will be able to express the powers of 
our Inner Real Self through our present-day personality, which is now 
pure and clean. However, it is a big mistake to think that in so doing, we 
will gain psycho-noetical powers. We will not gain anything we do not 

321
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
already have!” 
“Then  what?”  I  asked.  “You  will  simply  make  your  present-day  
personality capable of expressing the powers of your real Inner Self, 
of expressing the powers you already have.
This is the purpose of true introspection and self-control. At the 
same time you do the exercises on the etheric double of your material 
body. Then, you continue with the exercises on the etheric double of 
your  psychical  body  and  the  exercises  on  the  etheric  double  of  your  
noetical body. The purpose is to harmonise the etheric doubles of your 
bodies  and  to  complete  your  expression,  the  expression  of  your  real  
powers.
What  powers?  To  become  master  of  matter:  master  of  etheric  
substance-matter,   master   of   psychical   super-matter   and   master   
of  noetical  substance  respectively.  Then  you  will  become  master  of  
materialisation and dematerialisation.” 
Father explained that this is not easily achieved, but neither is it 
unachievable. 
“This is the purpose of our life. This is the reason we descended 
into  the  Material  Worlds!  Why  do  you  think  you  were  born  in  a  
material body? To know it, to govern it, to live as a phenomenon of 
Life. Why else? Why have you been born in this material body? You 
are  here  so  that  one  day  you  may  hear  after  a  hard  workday
 ‘Well 
done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few 
things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter into the joy 
of thy Lord’
 (Matthew 25:23).
Therefore,  first  we  have  to  become  master  of  our  home,  master  
of  our  material,  psychical  and  noetical  bodies,  and  their  etheric  
doubles. We have to know our etheric doubles, the different ethers of 
the different bodies and how they function. We have to know how to 
blend them in a harmonious way in order to make Etheric Vitality our 
‘Daily Bread.’ 
What do you think is our ‘Daily or rather our Heavenly Bread?’ 
When Christ spoke about the ‘Daily Bread’ in the Lord’s Prayer, what 
did He mean? What is our ‘Daily Bread?’ It is etheric, psychical and 
noetical Mind Vitality. We should mix them and make them one so 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY

as to be in perfect balance. We can read about this in the ‘Parable of 
the Leaven:’ 
‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven, which a 
woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was 
leavened’ 
(Matthew 13:33).”
That moment my mind turned to what he had said to me when he 
was taking me for the first time to school at the age of 6. I remember 
that when he came to pick me up, I said to him. “Father in the morning 
when you left me at school, the teachers recited the Morning Prayer 
and then they guided us to our classroom. I want to know how to pray. 
Please can you teach me?” “Of course, I will teach you how to pray, but 
I will do something that is more important, I will teach you how to 
make your life a prayer.” Now, I think I know what he meant.
His voice took me out of my thoughts.
“You should learn to do that,” he said. “When you have learnt it, 
you  will  have  everything  in  your  hands.  Everything  is  matter,  even  
the Psycho-Noetical Worlds. Matter is Mind energy. Everything is the 
Mind in varying degrees of vibration. Mind in its different degrees of 
vibration gives us the Noetic World (or State), the Noetical, Psychical, 
Material  and  the  Ethereal  World  in  between,  charged  with  Etheric  
Vitality.
We  are  not  the  etheric  doubles;  they  are  our  garments.  We  have  
to learn to use them, to see how they serve us and at the end to find 
out who we really are. Therefore, the main purpose of introspection is 
self-control. By doing the exercises and meditations as a present-day 
personality  self,  we  will  be  able  to  express  the  powers  of  our  Inner  
Self.
Once we know who we really are, it will be easier to express these 
powers.  We  will  discover  that  we  are  not  a  poor  and  weak  creature  
with  various  insignificant  time  and  place  insurmountable  problems  
that we think we are unable to overcome. We will see that in reality 
these are insignificant and negligible. Christ said, 
‘Ye are gods; And 
all of you are children of the most High’
 (Psalm 82:6).
This Self we will find as the God within, is what we have to express 
as our real Self. For this God, nothing is impossible. If we know and 
believe in His powers, in other words, if we have faith, we will tell a 
mountain to move, and it will move. For it is written in the Gospel:

323
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
‘Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall 
not only do what is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto 
this mountain, Be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea; it 
shall  be  done.  And  all  things  whatsoever  ye  shall  ask  in  prayer,  
believing, ye shall receive’
 (Matthew 21:21-22).
Matter is ready to obey us if we are its master, but it will not obey 
us  if  we  are  its  slave.  As  a  Seeker  of  the  Truth,  we  have  to  learn  to  
become a master of matter, and first of all, of that part of matter that 
is called our material body.
To analyse this further, we have to enter into introspection. How 
will you know your material body? From where will you start? If you 
have  some  knowledge  of  the  human  anatomy,  it  is  useful  because  
then you will know what organs you have in your material body and 
what purpose they serve. This will help you if you wish to become a 
therapist in the future.”
A thought came to my mind again. “Oh, this is the reason why my 
father gave me two books as a gift when I finished elementary school. 
The  first  book  was  the  Bible  and  the  second  one  was  a  book  on  the  
human anatomy.” Once again, he drew me out of my thoughts.
“Do you know how you will start?
You can see your material body in a mirror. You see its surface, 
the hands, the feet, the thighs and the head. Good. But how will you 
know it in a different way? How will you know it through the aesthetic 
ether of the etheric double?
You  have  to  sit  in  a  comfortable  way.  Place  your  hands  on  the  
solar plexus, more specifically on the navel, and take deep comfortable 
breaths. Do not pay attention to your lungs. No need to see your lungs 
in visualisation.
Through the aesthetic ether, you feel the air entering your lungs. 
You inhale and feel that your lungs and chest are filled with air; you 
exhale and see that something goes out of your chest. You feel that! 
Now, I am asking you, do you know how many times you inhale 
and  exhale  in  one  hour?  A  great  many  times,  but  none  of  these  
breaths  occurs  consciously!  You  inhale  and  exhale  subconsciously.  
Why? Because you do not concentrate on the aesthetic ether, so your 
inhalations and exhalations are not happening consciously.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
324
But now, something else will take place. Through concentration, 
you will pay attention and focus on your breathing.
You inhale and know that your lungs are filled with air. You feel 
being in your lungs. You exhale and know that the air goes out of your 
chest. You feel it, and you continue feeling it. When the air goes out of 
your lungs and chest, you do not lose the sense of feeling that you are 
concentrating on your lungs. Therefore, whether you inhale or exhale, 
the aesthetic ether is there, and you feel it.
Now, inhale consciously. Feel that your chest is filled with air. Feel 
your lungs. Feel them! Exhale. The air is out, but you still feel being 
in your chest, the aesthetic ether is there. So, the aesthetic ether is not 
the air or the oxygen! The oxygen is something else. 
Do  not  be  mistaken  in  thinking  that  the  air  you  breathe  is  your  
etheric  double.  You  already  have  the  aesthetic  ether  and  the  other  
forms of ether in you.
Through breathing, and through that form of energy called Etheric 
Vitality that you are getting through breathing, you enrich an already 
existing condition in your etheric double. But, you would not enrich 
the  Etheric  Vitality  of  your  etheric  body  as  creative  ether,  aesthetic  
ether, imprinting ether and kinetic ether if you were to inhale oxygen 
or air devoid of Etheric Vitality. So, the air we breath has to be charged 
with Etheric Vitality in order to be beneficial to us.
Another type of power exists, which does not derive from the Sun, 
but comes from everywhere and nowhere. This power is called Cosmic 
Rays and you must know how to inhale these Cosmic Rays.
You have to learn to breathe not only through your lungs, but also 
through the pores of your whole material body. You also have to learn 
other ways of breathing, noetical and psychical breathing.
In the future, we must work more systematically on the aesthetic 
ether. You already exercise with that. You do it when you concentrate 
on  the  different  parts  of  your  material  body,  both  internally  and  
externally on the surface of it as I teach you.
I  want  you  to  pay  attention  to  this.  You  will  observe  that  
concentration   on   certain   parts   of   your   body   is   easier,   whilst   
concentration  on  other  parts  becomes  more  difficult.  It  is  easier  to  
concentrate  on  places  where  you  have  a  small  disc  with  a  centre  of  

325
DISCOURSES WITH MY FATHER
rotation.  Etheric  Vitality  rotates  around  this  centre  exactly  like  the  
hands of a clock.
Do you know how many discs you have on your material body? 
Hundreds, but we will not talk about them now. The Holy Spirit takes 
care  of  these  discs  and  their  movement.  Through  the  creative  ether,  
the Holy Spirit causes their movement, which is subconscious to you. 
However, when you start to work on certain parts of your body where 
you have these discs, you will notice that it is easy to concentrate there, 
while it is more difficult to concentrate on other parts where there are 
no such discs. 
You have to learn to concentrate on the aesthetic ether anywhere 
you  want,  in  each  part  of  your  material  body  –  on  its  surface  or  in  
each and every cell inside your material body. Later, you will be able 
to accumulate and concentrate aesthetic ether outside your body. 
You will learn to project your Etheric Vitality out of your body or 
into the body of a patient. Then, you realise that from the moment you 
are able to expand your Etheric Vitality, you are not only working with 
aesthetic ether, but also with kinetic ether.”
“What is the difference between kinetic ether and aesthetic ether?” 
I asked.
“Think!  Is  there  a  function  of  aesthetic  ether  that  does  not  
simultaneously  contain  kinetic  ether?  You  can  try  to  use  the  one  or  
the other, but you will see that they work in unison. 
Anyway,  you  have  to  separate  these  two  qualities;  you  have  to  
distinguish  kinetic  ether  from  aesthetic  ether  so  that  you  come  to  
know aesthetic ether in its two conditions. By searching, you will find 
out that these two conditions cooperate. 
If  you  concentrate  on  a  part  of  your  material  body  and  feel  the  
aesthetic ether in it, you will automatically also use the kinetic ether. 
Maybe  you  will  not  do  it  consciously,  but  even  so  you  will  use  it  
subconsciously.
You can work on the aesthetic and kinetic ethers, but in any case 
you perform mechanically without fully concentrating on the aesthetic 
ether.  You  have  done  such  exercises  without  using  the  imprinting  
ether. You learn to use the aesthetic and kinetic ethers, starting from 
your material body.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
326
Now,  let  us  talk  about  the  imprinting  ether.  This  is  something  
different.  You  must  start  to  use  the  imprinting  ether  from  your  
noetical  body.  It  is  thought;  pure  thought,  Mind  substance  and  
Super-Substance, and you should form it from within and express it 
outwardly in time and place. You should form it into images, to create 
light  images.  But  please,  pay  attention  now;  by  creating  and  giving  
form  to  images,  don’t  you  use  a  kind  of  kinetic  ether  and  aesthetic  
ether in a slightly different way than previously?” 
I looked at him with both eyes and mouth wide open. He seemed 
so serious and urged me to think.
“I will explain to you. Previously you knew the aesthetic ether as 
connected to the way you feel your material body. However, now the 
aesthetic ether is something that gives you a certain form of emotion-
feeling because now you are on the aesthetic ether of your psychical 
body.” 
“And  how  about  the  kinetic  ether?”  I  said.  “Well,  this  kind  of  
kinetic  ether  is  very  different  from  what  I  mentioned  before.  When  
you  transfer  Etheric  Vitality  to  your  fingers,  arms,  elbows,  knees  or  
shoulder blades, the kinetic ether does not work in place, but in time. 
You  create  forms  in  time,  but  these  forms,  these  images  develop.  
When you start to see the light, you see how time intervenes and you 
have movement in time.” 
That  moment  my  head  started  spinning.  I  was  feeling  tired  and  
said, “Father, what do you think, isn’t it time to go to sleep? Can we 
continue tomorrow?” 
Taking me to bed I heard him saying, “I want you to study carefully 
the aesthetic and kinetic ethers in the etheric double of your material 
body. Then, study the new form of the aesthetic and kinetic ethers in 
time.  As  regards  imprinting  ether,  the  formation  of  noetical  images  
and  the  creation  of  noetical  light,  you  have  to  unceasingly  do  your  
exercises. 
You  have  to  become  master  of  Etheric  Vitality  on  the  noetical,  
psychical and material levels.”  



With my father on the veranda of our house on my 7
th
 birthday, in 1953

Sweet Memories
M
Y daily itinerary at year six of elementary school was to go to 
school at 7.30 in the morning, and come back at approximately 
1.30 pm. My school was almost next to our house, so it did not take 
me long to come home.
My first job was to place my schoolbag in the study room, wash 
my  hands  and  sit  at  the  table  with  the  rest  of  the  family.  My  father  
would offer the thanks-giving prayer, and then we would begin to eat 
our lunch.
After  an  hour’s  rest,  I  headed  to  the  study  room  to  do  my  
homework. I was very committed to this task. I arranged all the books 
and notebooks separately for each lesson, I worked out the next day’s 
schedule,  and  then  engaged  myself  in  studying  my  lessons.  Upon  
completing each lesson, I placed all the relevant books and notebooks 
in my school bag. In this manner, I completed all my homework for 
the following day.
If  I  was  in  the  mood,  I  also  studied  the  same  day’s  lessons,  so  
that  I  wouldn’t  have  to  deal  with  them.  In  the  context  of  the  lesson  
of  geography,  my  father  taught  me  how  to  draw  and  colour  maps  
and  impress  them  in  my  memory.  For  the  history  lesson,  I  used  to  
memorise the various types of temple pillars and know their names.
Alternatively,  I  announced  the  completion  of  my  homework  and  
so I was given permission to play outside for an hour or so.
That specific day, as I recall, having finished my school duties, my 
father asked me whether I would fancy listening to music with him, 
instead  of  playing  outdoors.  I  much  appreciated  the  idea  of  staying  
with him and bombarding him with lots of questions; what else could 
I  want?  I  did  not  have  the  slightest  idea  what  I  was  to  expect.  I  was  
oblivious  of  the  fact  that  those  sessions  were  part  of  my  curricular  
training in mysticism.
Father sat in his armchair and pointed at another armchair next 
to him, so that I would take a seat. I sat and waited for him to speak.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
332
He then smiled and said, ‘‘I will play a record on the gramophone 
for us to listen to. My dear Yiota, I want you to do as follows: Close 
your  eyes  and  try  to  attune  yourself  with  the  man  that  composed  
this music. Try to feel his thoughts and feelings, and his pain or joy. 
Should  you  perceive  images  emerging  from  the  music,  so  much  the  
better. I expect from you to sense his vibration through the music he 
composed.’’
As  I  was  embarrassed,  I  felt  that  I  should  take  this  lightly,  but  
instantly I changed my mind. At that very moment I reflected, ‘‘Things 
are getting serious, I will definitely try.’’
I  shut  my  eyes,  tried  to  calm  myself  and  started  listening  to  
the  music.  Some  time  elapsed  and  all  of  a  sudden  something  weird  
occurred  inside  me.  In  the  beginning,  I  felt  something  reminiscent  
of fear, as if a serious threat was approaching. Out of the blue, I saw 
a  forest  and  many  mounted  soldiers  taking  cover  behind  the  trees.  
‘‘What are they doing here,’’ I wondered.
In  a  while  I  realised  what  was  happening.  Another  big  troop  of  
cavalry was galloping in a valley. ‘‘Oh, my God’’ I exclaimed silently, 
‘‘they  are  going  to  be  attacked.  They  are  rushing  directly  into  an  
ambush!’’ I started screaming but no voice came out of me. I was under 
the impression that I closed my eyes, but my eyes were already shut. 
A  horrible  sound  was  heard,  battle  cries,  horse  neighs  full  of  pain  
merged with human groans and grunts. I felt desperate; my heart was 
pounding so forcefully that I thought it would be detached from my 
chest. At that very moment I sensed the hand of my father touching 
me on the shoulder, and saying to me, ‘‘Come now, relax. It’s over.’’ He 
took me in his arms and we stayed like this for quite a time.
Later on, when I came to my senses, I asked for an explanation. 
Father took the record cover and elaborated on the story.
‘‘This music was composed by the Russian Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. 
It is the Overture 1812. Napoleon attacked the Tsar and invaded Russia. 
This music composed by Tchaikovsky, refers to the Battle of Borodino.’’
Since  that  time,  we  frequently  used  to  sit  and  listen  to  music  
together.  In  this  way  he  was  tutoring  me  to  attune  to  the  mentality  
of the various composers and sense what exactly it was that they felt 
when they were composing music. There are so many things that one 
can perceive relating to people. Music, paintings, sculptures, writing

MY FATHER
pattern,  movements,  eye  gaze  and  so  many  other  aspects  of  their  
expression are excellent testimonials of their character.
Grandparents
My grandmother, on the side of my father’s family, was a dynamic 
person.  She  was  a  tall,  robust  and  patient  woman.  Her  dexterity  in  
hand  lace  and  its  beauty,  scarcely  remained  unobserved.  Her  name  
was Irene, and my sister was named after her.
Occasionally, Grandmother Irene fancied visiting friendly houses, 
in order to play bridge with other ladies of her social circle. One of the 
many stories I recall, is indicative of her dynamism and self-control.
That   day,   after   making   all   the   cosmetic   preparations   and   
prerequisites, as it was her custom, she wore a white collar dress she 
liked a lot, took her bag and umbrella, as it was drizzling, and set off 
on foot to visit her friend. The umbrella was huge with a big curved, 
hook-like handle. 
She started walking carefully along the road, lest she slip. A young 
lad on a bicycle made the terrible mistake to think that he could easily 
pinch grannie’s bag. Thus, passing by her he hastily snapped up the 
bag.
Grandmother  Irene,  being  as  cool  as  a  cucumber,  reversed  the  
umbrella and by using the handle she grabbed the young man by the 
throat,  pulling  him  back.  The  would-be  robber  naturally  fell  to  the  
road,  at  grannie’s  feet.  She  immediately  grasped  him  by  the  collar  
of his shirt, pulled him up and gave him two nasty slaps in the face, 
saying, ‘If you are in need of money, you should ask for it but definitely 
do not steal.’ Nevertheless, she gave him some money, let him off the 
hook and recommenced walking. We were informed of this incident 
later on, by some neighbours.
When my cousins and I visited our grandparents’ house to play, 
she used to appear offering us a treat of sour-cherry sweet. We laughed 
contently  with  the  witty  remark  that  “Here  we  are,  Granny-war  is  
coming!”

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
334
I did not have the opportunity to get to know my mother’s parents 
well, for they left this world when I was very young. I remember that 
they stayed with us in our house. I recall as a dream, my father holding 
me in his arms and taking me to Grandfather Theodoros’ room to see 
him. I must have been two years old. I presume my father knew that 
Grandpa was departing and wished that he would give his blessing. 
Grandfather put his shaking hand on my forehead, made the sign of 
the cross and smiled. He whispered something that of course I did not 
understand, and then my father took me to the other room. I never saw 
him again...
On  the  other  hand,  I  had  the  chance  to  get  very  well  acquainted  
with  my  mother’s  mother,  Katerina.  She  used  to  wake  up  very  early  
in  the  morning,  clean  the  yard  of  our  house  and  feed  the  hens  and  
the other livestock we kept in the backyard. She commented joyfully 
that children should eat fresh eggs. We used to have a little goat that 
provided us with all our everyday needs for milk. The goat wouldn’t 
allow  anyone  to  approach  it,  with  the  mere  exception  of  my  father.  
So, he used to milk it on a daily basis and give the milk to my mother 
or grandmother, to heat up. We pleasantly drank the lukewarm milk 
before heading to school.
Grandmother  Katerina  found  it  hard  to  accept  the  fact  that  the  
goat would not allow her to approach it, so one morning she decided 
to  milk  the  goat  by  herself.  After  a  while,  we  heard  her  screaming.  
We  rushed  hastily  outside  to  witness  Granny  lying  on  the  ground,  
suffering from acute pain; the goat had kicked her with its hind legs.
Father carefully took her in his arms and brought her inside the 
house. That time I realised how miniscule Grandmother Katerina was. 
He placed her gently on the bed and left her in the tender care of my 
mother. Out of the blue, I heard my grandmother asking my mother in 
an agitated manner, ‘How come the goat allows your husband, a city 
man, approach it and won’t allow me, since I am a genuine villager?’ 
My  mother  laughingly  responded,  ‘Why  don’t  we  go  ask  the  poor  
animal?’ 
A few months passed after this event. One day as I was returning 
from  school,  my  mother  asked  me  to  sit  by  my  grandmother;  she  
was not feeling very well. I sat by her side and caressed her hair. She 
smiled, and closed her eyes. In a while Mother came to ask me whether 
I would like to eat. ‘Granny is asleep,’ I said. She bent over, touched 

335
MY FATHER
her, and then started crying. I was frightened and asked Mother why 
she was crying. She hugged me and replied, ‘Grandmother Katerina is 
now with God.’
That  was  my  first  encounter  with  death;  I  was  only  seven  years  
old.  At  that  time  I  had  not  the  slightest  idea  that  in  another  seven  
years’  time,  I  would  be  having  my  second  and  much  more  painful  
encounter with death loss. It was inconceivable for me to imagine that 
God would recall my mother to be with Him. 
A Hilarious Story from my Childhood
There are far too many witty stories related to my childhood, so it 
is deemed impossible to include them all, in this first volume of my 
book. For the time being, I will share with you three funny instances.
One  day,  my  sister  and  I  overheard  a  conversation  between  my  
parents. We were aware of the fact that they were constantly assisting 
people  in  need,  in  various  ways.  However,  we  were  oblivious  of  the  
extent of their philanthropy.
“Anastasia,” my father said, “we should cut down on our expenses 
a bit because we have two daughters, and we should save up money for 
their dowry.” “Sure, you are absolutely right; we give away everything 
and  it  does  not  cross  our  minds  that  the  girls  are  growing  up,”  my  
mother responded in consent.
We retired silently, so as not to draw the attention of our parents, 
and headed to the garden, engrossed with our thoughts. “What was all 
this about?” I asked. My sister fervently interjected, “Father said that 
we  need  to  save  up,  so  we  will  help  them  out.”  I  spotted  something  
cunning in her gaze. I realized that my constantly mischievous sister 
had a brainstorm. “Irene don’t get involved, it is none of our business; 
our parents are quite capable of handling the situation,” I exclaimed 
in frustration.
I was under the impression that the whole issue had been settled. 
Nevertheless, the next day I saw her holding a box and a fly-killing 
contraption in her hands, killing scores of flies on the windows, and 
finally safekeeping them in that precious box of hers.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
336
This  odd  activity  did  not  escape  my  parents’  attention,  so  soon  
she  was  summoned  for  interrogation.  No  answer  could  be  extracted  
out  of  Irene’s  hermetically  sealed  lips,  and  she  meticulously  carried  
on with her endeavour. “What is she up to?” they asked me. “I haven’t 
got  a  clue  what  she  is  doing,”  I  replied.  “She  is  into  a  new  naughty  
achievement,” Mother remarked in dismay. 
The whole matter ended there. Two days had elapsed. Upon our 
return from school, we took off our school uniform and put on clean 
clothes, washed our hands and sat at the table for our lunch.
Father was ready to pray but Irene was absent. “Irene, come at once 
and sit at the table; we are eating,” Mother cried out. In the end, Irene 
appeared  holding  a  box  in  her  hand.  She  sat  down  and  announced  
solemnly,  “A  few  days  ago  we  heard  that  expenditure  ought  to  be  
reduced in this house of ours, therefore Mother, tomorrow you needn’t 
buy meat, because it is expensive. You will prepare a soup for us, we 
have plenty of meat now,” and instantly she offered her the box with 
the dead flies.
You  cannot  imagine  the  commotion  she  generated.  For  quite  a  
time no one could eat, as all of us were laughing in tears... 
Another Funny Story from my Childhood
A hundred metres from our house was the grocery shop belonging 
to my mother’s brother, Andreas. That day, my father and I wanted to 
give my mother a helping hand, so we headed for Uncle’s shop to do 
the regular shopping. After buying all the supplies, we returned home.
Father  took  the  eggs  in  order  to  put  them  into  the  refrigerator.  
For a moment, I spotted a glance in his eyes, a mysterious spark and 
a  cunning  smile,  full  of  insinuations.  Immediately  I  said  to  myself,  
“Father is up to something, let’s wait and see.” Suddenly, he picked-
up  an  egg  and  placed  it  on  the  table.  Miraculously,  the  egg  did  not  
lean sideways and remained standing still in an upright position. My 
eyes opened wide and my face took on an expression of amazement. 
I called my sister, “Irene, come right now and have a look!” She came, 
examined the egg and left the room without a single word.

337
MY FATHER
For  the  next  few  days,  I  began  to  experiment  with  the  egg.  My  
solemn intention was to repeat my father’s feat but alas the egg was 
so  obstinate  that  it  refused  to  stand  still  and  kept  leaning  on  the  
table. Then, I had the bright idea to ask for my father’s assistance in 
comprehending how he did it, so that I would be able to imitate him. 
Father stood beside me and kept on advising me: “Empty your mind, 
think of nothing and just concentrate on what you want to achieve.” 
My  sister  was  watching  us  very  carefully  but  remained  silent.  The  
same  scene  was  repeated  for  the  next  few  days  to  come.  My  failure  
to  achieve  the  upright  egg  stand-still  manoeuvre,  made  me  more  
determined.
The day after, I sat on the table and tried to do it under my father’s 
guidance. Irene, dashed furiously into the room and stood in front of 
me. Her head was just above the table. And then she declared to me, 
“You are trying to do this for so many days, big deal.”
I looked at her with astonishment and said, “What are you saying 
dear,  can  you  do  it?”  “Of  course  I  can,”  she  exclaimed,  and  all  of  a  
sudden grasped the egg and smashed it on the table. As expected, the 
egg broke, and what was left of it stood proudly in an upright position 
on the table. “You see, it is so simple,” she stated in a victorious and 
reassuring voice.” Father and Mother burst out laughing. “Dear sister, 
thank you very much for your valuable contribution, if this is the case 
I can also do it,” I answered back ironically.
The Notorious Bicycle Incidents
Father used to commute by bicycle. Every morning he would ride 
his  bicycle  and  head  off  for  the  Cyprus  Government  Printing  Office  
near the centre of Nicosia. The distance was approximately two miles. 
We could estimate pretty accurately the time of his return home, and 
all of us awaited eagerly at the doorstep to hear him tinkle his bicycle 
bell, signaling his arrival. 
At  times  though,  when  he  was  late,  Mother  would  be  instantly  
alarmed.  Immediately,  she  would  take  us  by  the  hand  and  the  three  
of  us  would  start  marching  at  a  rapid  pace  in  the  direction  of  his  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
338
office. At some point along the way, we would see Father pushing his 
incapacitated bicycle and heading for home. What had happened? 
When  riding,  he  often  used  to  reflect  on  the  various  aspects  of  
Truth,  attuning  himself  to  the  Spiritual  World  or  projecting  his  
consciousness in order to assist his fellow men in need. Occasionally, 
the  bicycle  deviated  from  its  course  and  fell  into  a  gutter  or  rough  
terrain, bringing back my father abruptly to the realities of the gross 
material plane. Slightly injured and full of dirt and soil, Father would 
pick  up  his  poor  damaged  wreck  of  a  bicycle  and  head  off  on  foot  
to  Strovolos.  Mother,  relieved  that  he  was  out  of  danger,  would  
reprimand  him  for  his  lack  of  attention.  In  the  end,  all  of  us  would  
find the whole incident comical and would laugh discretely. You see, 
Earth is a treacherous place to live on!
The Scholarship to Turkey
At some point Father decided to be self-instructed in the Turkish 
language. He was motivated by the fact that 18% of the inhabitants of 
the island were Turkish Cypriots. Many of his friends were Turkish 
speaking.  So,  he  started  studying  the  Turkish  language  by  himself.  
Being akin to absorbing and assimilating languages, in a few months 
he effortlessly became fluent in Turkish. 
When  he  saw  an  advertisement  in  the  newspaper  offering  a  
scholarship on Ottoman Studies in Constantinople (Istanbul), Turkey, 
he  decided  to  apply.  Such  was  his  audacity...  He  enquired  about  
the  professor  who  was  to  examine  him.  Apparently,  he  was  a  well  
known and very important contemporary poet and scholar, who had 
recently lost his beloved wife. Deeply moved by her death, he wrote 
the poem ‘Aysiz Geceler - Moonless Nights.’ Father somehow managed 
to intercept all the above pieces of information and was accordingly 
prepared for the interview.
On  the  day  of  the  examination,  he  resourcefully  guided  the  
professor  (the  name  of  whom  I  cannot  recall)  to  ask  him  who  was  
his  favorite  Turkish  poet.  Without  hesitation  my  father  gave  the  
professor’s name. The noble professor, asked my father in astonishment 

339
MY FATHER
what  his  favorite  poem  was.  Father  took  the  opportunity  and  said,  
“Aysiz Geceler, would you like me Sir to recite the poem for you?” The 
professor  was  speechless  and  nodded  affirmatively.  When  my  father  
finished, he stood up and deeply moved embraced him affectionately 
bursting  into  tears.  Then,  he  revealed  that  he  was  the  composer  of  
the poem and granted Father a full scholarship with distinction. My 
father, although he rejected the scholarship at a later stage and did not 
go to Turkey, always held the memory of this professor in reverence 
and love. 
A Sacred Promise
Years after I got married, I followed my father’s advice to help my 
husband fulfill his wish to become a man of business. Of course, I did 
not completely give-up studying with my father.
Some years passed by and there was a period when I had to live 
in England for two years. Coming back, I noticed that my father was 
a little sad, even though he never complained. I asked him what the 
reason was and he opened his heart to me. “I have so many students 
and I spent all my life teaching them, giving them all this knowledge. 
Some  of  them,  three  men,  showed  more  interest  and  have  been  
studying  with  me  for  twenty  years.  After  all  those  years,  I  observe  
that  they  have  not  annihilated  the  egoism  of  their  personality,  their  
passions and their weaknesses.”
To reduce his bitterness, I said without thinking carefully, “You see, 
Father, you do not just have male students but also female ones! Why 
do you direct all your attention to the men and neglect the women? I 
know you, so I know that for you men and women are equal.”
“I  thought  that  men  have  more  time  for  this  kind  of  work,”  he  
replied. “Women also have to take care of their homes, their husbands 
and children.”
Suddenly he looked at me, and I had a thought in my mind, “No, 
no, no, I do not mean myself.” “Why not?,” he asked. “Your husband 
is  a  successful  businessman  now,  and  you  do  not  have  children  of  
your  own.  And  most  of  all,  I  trust  you.  I  know  that  you  will  never  
change the teachings, as others have tried to do.”

340
“Give me some time to think,” I replied, “it is a great responsibility, 
and I do not know if my shoulders can carry it. This is a heavy cross 
to bear, Father!”
“You are my child, I know you very well. And I know you can do 
it,” he replied.
A week later, I told him that I was ready to try!
My father wanted to write his books, so that his students would 
have material to work on. He was occupied with the Stoa lessons from 
Monday to Thursday. He decided, “I will teach Monday and Tuesday. 
Wednesday  you  will  give  the  meditation,  and  Thursday  you  will  do  
the healings. In this way, I will have more time to write.”
To  be  honest,  I  was  very  intimidated.  I  had  never  assumed  such  
responsibility before! “To give the meditations without your guidance, 
you mean?” “Sure,” he said, “go by your own experience.”
“And  what  about  healing?”  “Put  into  practice  what  I  have  taught  
you! I am not your master, I am your father!”
This  is  how  I  started.  Some  years  passed  by,  which  entailed  
travelling  with  my  father  and  sharing  the  work  with  him,  until  he  
completed  the  cycle  of  his  life  on  Earth.  All  his  work  has  remained  
in  my  hands.  I  know  that  my  father’s  teaching  is  the  most  complete  
teaching. There is no need to take anything away or to add anything. 
Father provided this teaching in his own way, and I am giving the 
same teaching in my own way. Since I am a woman, my way might be 
a softer one, but of course this is my personal view.
As my father used to say, those who attend the lessons should hear 
the lectures, learn from them and take what is good in order to improve 
their  lives.  They  should  not  see  their  teachers  as  masters  or  gurus.
We have to be our own masters! I believe that if we want to be good 
teachers, we have to be open to learn from our students.

I
T  is  difficult  to  talk  about  and  portray  a  mystic.  It  is  even  more  
difficult to talk about a mystic who is your father. It is impossible to 
give an accurate account of his life and his philosophy in one lecture. 
I will therefore, try to give you glimpses into his life and teachings.
My father was born on the 12-12-1912. There will be a few raised 
eyebrows at this triple 12. I am sure that numerologists would find a 
suitable  interpretation  for  this  birth  date  but  we  do  not  really  need  
any interpretation.
Very early in his life, Father became aware that his consciousness 
was  more  developed  than  that  of  other  children.  Being  aware  of  
what  other  people  thought,  was  something  natural  for  him.  He  did  
not  realise  that  other  children  were  different.  Nobody  seemed  to  
understand him when he talked about the presence of Nature Spirits 
and of other BE-ings, that were invisible to others. I know that he was 
lonely and that he felt unhappy many times. Maybe, this is the reason 
why he made his own family happy.
In  small  private  circles  my  father  often  complained  that  his  
childhood had been unhappy. His father, being a rear-admiral, held a 
high position in the British Naval administration in Cyprus. There is 
an anecdote, which my grandfather often narrated:
The  elementary  school  teacher  asked  my  father  to  go  to  the  
blackboard  and  solve  a  maths  problem.  Father  excused  himself  and  
said that he had not done his homework properly and would therefore 
not be able to solve the problem. The teacher insisted and said, “Let 
us  see  how  much  you  remember.”  When  my  father  stood  at  the  
blackboard  with  the  chalk  in  his  hand,  a  presence  behind  him  said,  
“Do  not  worry  Stelios,  I  am  with  you  and  I  will  guide  your  hand  to  
write  the  correct  solution  on  the  blackboard.”  When  my  father  had  
finished, the teacher was furious with him and said, “You lied to me. 
If you had not done your homework you could have never solved this 
problem.  Shame  on  you.  I  have  to  punish  you.  Leave  the  room  and  
stand outside the door in the hall.”

342
By  ‘chance,’  as  we  tend  to  believe,  the  school  Director  passed  by  
and  asked  my  father  why  he  was  standing  there.  My  father  related  
exactly  what  had  happened.  Fortunately,  the  Director  was  aware  of  
spiritual dimensions. He took my father to his office and asked him 
many questions about his invisible helper. When he heard that this 
‘Helper’ could solve any problem, the Director asked my father’s father 
whether he would agree to an experiment with his son. The teachers at 
school had a mathematical problem of which they knew the answer, 
but  could  not  find  the  details  of  the  solution.  Father,  with  the  help  
of  his  ‘Invisible  Helper  and  Guide,’  solved  the  problem.  Then,  they  
were interested in the translation of a Latin text. My father asked, “Do 
you want the translation in Modern Greek or in Ancient Greek?” The 
Director told my father to be very discreet about his relationship with 
spirits because people would not understand him. In a conversation 
with my grandfather following this incident, the Director said, “What 
are we to teach this boy? He knows more than we do.”
At a very young age, my father became aware of all his previous 
incarnations. To him reincarnation was an absolute fact and his whole 
philosophy is based on this belief. He remembered, for instance, the 
time he spent with Yiohannan, St. John the Evangelist, during the life 
of Joshua Immanuel the Christ. When my father was seven years old, 
Yiohannan gave him the following Seven Promises, which became the 
vows of all Seekers after the Truth. Father never had any ‘Disciples.’ He 
never wanted to be a ‘Guru.’ He merely called his students ‘Reseachers 
or Seekers after the Truth.’
The Seven Promises of the Researchers after the Truth
I Promise to Myself
1. To serve at all times and in all places Absolute BE-ingness to 
whom I whole-heartedly belong.
2. To be ready at all times and in all places to serve the Divine 
Plan.
3. To make good use of the Divine Gifts of Thought and Word at 
all times, in all places and under all circumstances.
4. To endure patiently, without complaining, all forms of trials and 
tribulations, which the most-wise Divine Law may bestow upon 
me.

343
MY FATHER
5. To love and serve my fellow Human Beings sincerely from the 
depths of my heart and Soul, no matter what their behaviour 
may be towards me.
6. To meditate and to contemplate daily Absolute BE-ingness, with 
the objective of total coordination of my thoughts, desires, words 
and actions with Its Divine Will.
7. To investigate and check every night whether all my thoughts, 
desires,  words  and  actions  are  in  absolute  harmony  with  the  
Divine Law.
This last Promise gave rise to what my father called ‘Introspection.’ 
He considered this exercise most important and an absolute ‘must’ for 
every seeker of the Truth. Every night just prior to sleep, the student 
recalls the day from the beginning to the end, and after having relaxed 
completely he sees himself in each encounter and situation of that day 
and asks himself the following questions:
What did I think or feel that I should not have thought or felt?
What did I not think or feel that I should have thought or felt? 
What did I say that I should not have said?
What did I not say that I should have said? 
What did I do that I should not have done?
What did I not do that I should have done?
Do not accuse or praise yourself but rather observe as an outside 
observer. In this exercise, the seeker of the Truth will learn to trace his 
emotions, thoughts and actions to their source, the purpose being to 
gradually eliminate egoism from his personality.
During his lifetime, Father managed to accomplish in full the most 
difficult Fifth Promise of unconditional Love, thus paying homage to 
his Most Beloved One, Joshua Immanuel the Christ. And believe me, 
after going through multiple betrayals, duplicities and persecutions, 
this  was  a  paramount  achievement.  Recollecting  his  life,  he  came  
without  any  bitterness  or  complaint  to  the  valid  conclusion  that:  “I  
have  drunk  the  cup  of  ungratefulness  unto  the  last  drop.”  He  also  
warned me: “Sometime you will realise the solitude that a Master feels 
in this world.”

  When  my  father  was  very  young,  he  spent  much  time  at  home  
with his Nanny. She knew that he was lonely and taught him the art 
of embroidery. He has always enjoyed pieces of embroidered art. This 
derives from one of his previous incarnations. At that time, he studied 
extensively  the  Cypriot  art  of  embroidery,  which  in  fact  embodies  
sequences and arrangements of sacred symbols. But of course, this is 
another story that I promise to present in depth in the next volume of 
this book.
He  would  listen  carefully  when  adults  discussed  their  problems  
and occasionally offered to comment, which often amazed them. On 
one occasion his father took him aside and said to him, “My son, tell 
me, are you an angel or a devil?” Father always smiled when he told 
this story because his answer was, “Probably a bit of both.”
At  school  he  excelled  in  Music,  Art  and  Languages.  He  studied  
the violin and the piano, and later composed his own songs. His Art 
teacher urged him to sign his oil paintings as ‘G.M.’ - Grand Master.
He  mastered  the  Turkish  language  so  well  that  he  was  offered  a  
scholarship to study in Turkey, which he did not take up. Instead he 
later obtained a Doctorate in Philosophy, a Doctorate in Divinity and 
some other degrees from British Universities. He knew many languages, 
Modern and Ancient Greek, Turkish, Latin, Russian, English, French, 
Italian, Armenian, Sanskrit, Aramaic and the Hieroglyphic Language 
of ancient Egypt.
We  were  a  happy  family:  my  father,  my  mother  (who  was  a  
schoolteacher before she got married), my younger sister and myself. 
When I was fourteen years old, my mother passed over. It was a big 
shock  for  all  of  us.  From  then  on  my  father  was,  for  my  sister  and  
me,  both  a  father  and  a  mother.  He  was  the  most  loving  father  that  
anybody could have.
My father’s house was always full; neighbours, students or people 
who had come to be healed. From early childhood, he had the gift of 
healing. Sometimes he saw up to eighty people in a day. Most of them 
received healing. And when they thanked him, he would say, “Thank 
God, not me.” Some healings were so extraordinary that people called 
them miraculous. But my father always said, “They are not miracles. 
If you know the Laws of Nature you will understand.”

345
MY FATHER
If I was to give you the essence of my father’s teachings in just two 
words,  it  would  be  “Wake-up!”  He  loved  to  stir  people  out  of  their  
spiritual slumber by challenging them. “Who are you, what are you?” 
he would ask, and add “You are not your emotions, your desires, nor 
your thoughts. You are not your bodies but something far greater. “I 
have said, Ye are gods; And all of you are children of the most High.” 
(Psalm 82:6). Furthermore, Jesus reiterated, “Is it not written in your 
law, I said, Ye are gods?” (John 10:34).
Father used to say that we only need two books in our life: One is 
the New Testament and the other is the Book of our Life. In the Book 
of our Life we start a new page every day. Never mind if the last page 
is  soiled.  Start  a  fresh  clean  page  and  don’t  look  back!  The  Godman  
Joshua Immanuel the Christ, in St. Luke’s gospel, states emphatically, 
“No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit 
for the Kingdom of God” (Luke 9:62).
My father loved the New Testament and preferred the King James 
Version (KJV) of the Holy Bible. He used to say that the New Testament 
should be a seeker’s most precious companion. Unfortunately, much 
has  been  removed  or  changed  by  the  early  Fathers  of  the  Church,  
but  nevertheless,  he  who  can  read  the  New  Testament  with  an  open  
mind for spiritual truth, will still find a great deal of most valuable 
information.  He  was  also  fond  of  the  Parables  of  Joshua  Immanuel,  
and at some stage he wrote a book elaborating on how to decode the 
great lessons they convey.
For example, let us look at the parable of the unclean spirit that 
came  out  of  a  man,  went  through  dry  places,  collected  seven  other  
spirits  more  wicked  than  itself  and  returned  to  the  man.  Father  
preferred the term ‘elemental’ to that of ‘unclean spirit.’ Every thought, 
every  emotion,  every  desire,  creates  a  thought-form,  an  emotional  
thought-form  or  a  pure  thought-form.  Christ  knew  this  difference  
when He called these spirits or elementals ‘unclean’ and He describes 
in  this  parable  how  these  elementals  are  created,  the  moment  they  
leave  their  ‘home.’  Their  ‘home’  is  the  personality  of  Man.  When  an  
elemental is created, either by thought or emotion or both, it vibrates 
at  the  same  rate  as  its  creator.  The  elemental  has  its  own  life  and  
identity, and of course, a kind of intelligence.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
346
Having left the personality, the elemental says, “I will return home 
to  my  creator  to  be  re-energised,  to  obtain  more  energy.”  However,  
in coming back, it brings with it ‘another seven more wicked spirits.’ 
Why do we attract such ‘spirits,’ such elementals? We are aware of the 
universal principle at work according to which, ‘Like seeks and attracts 
like.’ Therefore, when an elemental vibrates at the same rate as other 
such elementals, then it attracts entities vibrating at the same rate of 
vibration as itself. To make matters worse, they group up forming a 
‘legion’ and come back to us. Consequently, a reasoning Human Being 
should be prompted to realise that every thought, good or bad, returns 
to the thinker.
Father used to emphasise, “Be the master of your thoughts, feelings 
and  emotions,  and  not  their  slave!  Just  try  to  concentrate  for  some  
minutes  on  your  thoughts  and  you  will  realise  how  difficult  it  is  to  
control them.”
Many of my father’s lessons started with the powerful statement, 
“What  Is,  what  always  Was  and  what  always  will  Be,  is  the  
Absolute  Infinite  BE-ingness  God,  as  the  Absolute  Infinite  
Reality.”
  He  stressed  that  within  the  Multiplicity  of  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness, all Divine BE-ings - Monads express the Divine Common 
Selfhood as gods within God. And we are not referring to pantheism! 
Father was very clear, “There is only One God in its Trinity: Absolute 
Infinite BE-ingness, the Logos and the Holy Spirit. God expresses Itself 
in  Itself  as  Creation  by  ‘Euareskeia’  or  Will-Pleasure.”  In  this  case,  
the  Greek  word  ‘Euareskeia-Eὐαρέσκεια’  conveys  a  sense  of  Divine  
Pleasure emanating from a bountiful warm and generous source.
A  sketch  by  my  father  in  ancient  Egyptian  Hieroglyphics  representing  the  
concept  of  ‘Euareskeia’  from  a  Human  standpoint.  Here  the  mystic  stands  
in  reverence  with  infinite  love  at  the  feet  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness;  he  
understands  the  bounty  of  the  gifts  and  Love  bestowed  both  upon  the  
Universes  and  him.  In  his  effort  to  reciprocate,  he  offers  a  token  from  the  
Divine Gifts he has received, exclaiming in a loud voice: ‘T-taa La T-taa Toi 
Kha,’ meaning ‘I give Thee my utmost love deriving from Thine Impeccable 
Love and Will-Pleasure.’

347
MY FATHER
Now,   what   are   the   Worlds   of   Creation   made   of?   Absolute   
BE-ingness  and  the  Divine  BE-ings  emanate  what  my  father  called  
‘the  Mind.’  This  Holy  Substance  is  used  in  various  frequencies  of  
vibration. It ranges from Super-Light, to psycho-noetical super-matter 
and substance, down to matter, which is Mind in solid form.
Our bodies are also made up of Mind: the gross material body of 
Mind solid matter; the psychical body, our body of emotion, of Mind 
super-matter;  and  our  noetical  body,  our  body  of  thought,  of  Mind  
substance.  We  have  already  said,  when  we  talked  about  elementals,  
that every thought and every emotion adhere to a common form made 
up of Mind substance and super-matter respectively.
Father  liked  to  confront  and  challenge  people  with  unexpected  
questions. He might, for instance, ask a person, “Do you have a Soul?” 
“Yes, of course,” the person would answer. And my father would laugh 
and say, 
“Oh no, you are a Soul and you have a body.”
According to my father’s teaching, Man originates from a ray of a 
Holy Monad. The ray of Spirit passes through the Idea of Archangelic 
Man, the Idea of Heavenly Man, which is to be shaped according to 
the Law of the Human Form. From that point, a Guardian Archangel 
is ‘Egofied’ with the Spirit, which is to be humanised. ‘Egofied’ is the 
perfect  attunement  of  our  Guardian  Archangel  with  our  Spirit-Ego.  
It  is  as  if  you  put  together  two  candle  flames  and  they  become  one,  
but yet if you separate the candles the flames become two again. As a 
principle, when two states are united in order to manifest a third state 
that entails both of them, they never lose their identity.
Hence,  a  small  ray  of  our  Spirit-Ego  BE-ing  is  formed  into  the  
Self-aware Soul. Now, we have two foundations for the Inner Self: The 
Holy-Monadic Self within the Absolute BE-ingness and Its emanation, 
the Self-aware Soul. As the Spirit-Ego BE-ing gives birth to the Self-
aware Soul, the Soul gives life to its own projection. This projection is 
what we call our Permanent Personality. Descending into the Worlds 
of Existence it takes on its own colour and designs its own projections. 
As long as it remains in the worlds of time and space-place, it assumes 
many  names  and  the  attire  of  many  present-day  personalities,  and  
expresses itself in these worlds in multiple ways. 
However, we should never lose sight of our aim to return to where 
we came from. For my father, one of the most important parables was 
the  Prodigal  Son,  which  symbolises  our  descent  into  the  Worlds  of  

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
348
Separateness and our return to the all-loving Heavenly Father.
There are two states or conditions of things:
(a) BE-ingness: The Eternal in the Absolute Infinite BE-ingness, 
never changing, Everlasting, in the Absolute Infinite Selfhood.
(b) Existence: What we can see, the expression or manifestation 
of  this  BE-ingness  in  the  World  of  Existence.  The  World  of  
Existence  is  in  the  World  of  BE-ingness  because  in  order  to  
exist every form must have BE-ingness in it.
Father  never  prepared  any  lesson  or  lecture.  If  students  asked  
him, “What are you going to talk about today,” he would say, 
“Have 
you ever seen me carrying a paper? When we are in the Stoa, 
Yiohannan will know exactly what is needed.”
Never  did  my  father  claim  to  know  all  the  answers.  To  the  
question  why  we  Human  Beings  have  come  to  live  in  this  World  of  
Separateness  –  have  we  fallen  from  grace?  he  used  to  say  that  this  
burning  question  has  never  been  answered.  “Even  those  Great  Ones  
who have raised their Self-consciousness to the highest levels of Self 
Super-consciousness, remain silent,” he said. And he added that “On 
the material plane of the planet there are no trust-worthy traces that 
would allow a scientist to come to a reasonable conclusion regarding 
the  origin  of  Man.  The  theory  of  Charles  Darwin  definitely  cannot  
satisfy serious seekers after the Truth,” he stated most emphatically.
Did  my  father  read  the  thoughts  of  other  people?  No,  but  
occasionally he made an exception when he had to know for healing 
or other beneficial purposes. Then, he would attune to the person and 
know exactly what he was thinking. However, he often said, 
“To be 
able to know what people think is not a blessing.”
 If people asked 
him about their previous incarnations he would say that it is by the 
mercy of God that they can not remember. To be able to face what we 
have been and what we have done in the past needs a better mental 
and spiritual constitution than most people possess.
Father had a great sense of humour. We should not take the little 
problems of everyday life too seriously. When someone with a petty 
problem  came  to  him,  he  would  ask  him  “How  important  is  this  
problem? Would people in a hundred years still talk of it?” One of his 
favourite sayings was: 
“Nothing matters much and most things do 
not matter at all.”

349
MY FATHER
Titles  were  of  no  importance  to  my  father.  He  wanted  to  be  a  
Brother-guide and friend. When someone asked him whether he was 
ambitious, he said, “Yes, I would like to be a handkerchief to dry the 
tears of people.”
“Titles  are  absolutely  unnecessary,”  he  said  on  many  occasions,  
and  when  a  journalist  referred  to  ‘The  Magus  of  Strovolos’  (the  title  
Markides gave to his first book), my father concluded, “and definitely 
not the word ‘magus,’ for God’s sake.” He considered this title that was 
bestowed upon him, without his consent, as abominable.
After  the  publication  of  Markides’  books  about  my  father,  the  
number of visitors to Strovolos increased. On some days, hundreds of 
people would come to hear my father’s lectures. Many were primarily 
interested in being healed. In his last year my father spent more time 
teaching  and  preparing  his  books.  He  realised  that  many  people,  
whom  he  had  healed,  in  due  course  suffered  a  relapse  because  they  
could not or did not want to understand his teachings. 
He always stressed the point that everybody should control their 
thoughts  and  emotions,  reduce  their  egoism  and  love  God  and  all  
Human Beings. This is the basis for health and happiness. Feeling the 
need to be in the presence of a Master or to be surrounded by all the 
sacred books of the world, is like relying on crutches to move along 
the way. A Master may advise us on how to avoid unnecessary detours. 
Yet, the work has to be done by ourselves. This hard work has to be 
undertaken for years, or as my father often said, for many centuries.

Into the Unfathomable Depths of the Soul
My Father’s Paintings as Testimonials
A
BSOLUTE Infinite BE-ingness God is Spirit. Our Spirit-Soul-Ego 
Self  is  also  Spirit.  Suppose  that  the  Divine  Father  is  the  ocean  
of  Spirit,  then  every  man  is  an  individual  and  unique  droplet;  an  
indispensable part of the vast oceanic body, bearing all the qualitative 
characteristics  of  the  ocean.  Nevertheless,  a  droplet  quantitatively  is  
not the ocean, but only a small token of it. 
Thus upon descent from the Idea of the Divine Man, every Human 
Being expresses his Divine Nature, as well as the unique characteristics 
of his Spirit-Soul-Ego Self. We are identical in Nature, yet we differ 
in expression. No one can claim that he was not endowed by God. The 
Prodigal Son takes with him “The portion of goods that falleth to him” 
(Luke  15:11).  The  present-day  personality  self-aware  self  has  all  the  
credentials and individual characteristics of the Spirit-Soul-Ego Self.
With  observation,  contemplation  and  deep  meditation  on  the  
deeds  of  our  present-day  personality,  we  can  sense  and  discern  the  
numerous  talents  that  the  Divine  Father  has  bestowed  upon  us,  His  
Children.  By  studying  our  personality  we  get  to  know  our  Spirit-
Soul-Ego  Self.  Oddly,  this  mundane  reflexion-manifestation  of  the  
Soul bears all the testimonials of our Spirit.
I believe that my father made good use of the talents God granted 
him, and multiplied them. If we were to gaze at his Spirit-Soul-Ego 
Self, we should definitely get to know his interests and expressions. 
Being  an  artist,  he  presented  his  accumulated  experience  and  the  
essence of his Soul in his symbolic paintings. Every single painting 
of his is a great lesson, as well as a living talisman for protection and 
illumination. 
So now, I will gradually lead you on a mysterious quest through 
the  unfathomable  depths  of  his  Spirit-Soul-Ego  Self,  by  briefly  
presenting six of his paintings.

URING his years at the American Academy High School in Larnaca, 
Cyprus,  Father  decided  to  participate  in  a  painting  competition  
organised  by  the  school.  Yet,  there  was  a  strict  participation  clause  
that  all  contestants  should  belong  to  a  certain  age  group.  My  father  
was  under  sixteen  and  technically  speaking  he  was  not  eligible  to  
participate  when  he  presented  this  painting  to  his  Art  teacher.  But  
the  teacher,  who  was  amazed  by  his  work,  told  him  to  sign  his  oil  
painting as ‘G.M.’ - Grand Master. In this manner, his teacher intended 
to deceive the juries. 
To his dismay, Daskalos’ painting won the first prize and therefore 
the Art teacher had to reveal the name of the student and in so doing 
confess  his  mischief  to  the  Schoolmaster.  He  apologised  saying  that  
the  painting  was  exquisite  and  it  would  be  a  great  injustice  to  be  
excluded on the basis of the age criterion. Finally, the whole issue was 
settled  and  my  father  was  asked  to  sign  it  with  his  true  name.  This  
explains the two signatures seen on the lower left and right corners.
A Seascape
My Father’s Very First Painting

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
352
This work, painted directly on a wooden board, is a scene depicting 
a stormy sea. It could be interpreted in a twofold way: ‘Awaiting the 
oncoming tempest’ or ‘After the tempest.’
What   is   amazing,   is   the   profound   and   intense   symbolism   
embedded in the painting by a fifteen-year-old adolescent, who had 
just presented his first work as an artist. Let us try to briefly unveil the 
great Truths conveyed by my father:
  In  the  sky  (Noetic  and  Higher  Noetical  Worlds)  shades  of  
purple  and  golden-yellow  colours  dominate,  signalling  the  nature  
of  vibrations  in  these  worlds.  The  blue  sea  stands  for  the  psycho-
noetical planes and the land for the gross material plane. When facing 
the  painting,  on  the  left  hand  side  the  two  cliffs  symbolise  Duality  
and Separateness reigning over the three lower worlds, causing all the 
turmoil  and  restlessness  (the  rough  sea  and  the  tempest).  The  three  
snow-white seagulls on the left represent the Holy Trinity overlooking 
and blessing the worlds, whereas the group of the four darker seagulls 
in the middle of the painting stands for the Law of Tetractys deriving 
from the Holy Trinity.
Lastly, the two white seagulls on the right hand side symbolise the 
immaculate Law of Duality as a Divine State, standing apart from the 
mundane. From the standpoint of the Absolute BE-ingness, Number 
3 cooperates and combines harmoniously with Numbers 4 and 2, now 
presenting Number 9 – the gathering and manifestation of the Holy 
Archangels, the Sons of Spirit, Light and Fire, our Elder Brethren. 
The  three  minor  rocks  near  the  coast  indicate  the  great  and  
mysterious Law of Reflexion. They reflect and embody Number 3 in a 
material way. The same applies with the next row of the two rocks on 
the verge of the sea and land (a reflexion of Number 2) and the lone 
rock on the coast (a reflexion of the most Holy Number 1). The group 
of rocks above, when observed in unity, form an inverted triangle, the 
reflexion  of  the  Triangle  of  the  Holy  Trinity  in  Its  Will-Pleasure  to  
manifest Itself in Itself. Hence, Three (3) and Three (3) make the Holy 
Number 6, the vehicle of the Logos in expression.
Adjacently, a couple of rocks signify the domination of Duality and 
Separateness in the Gross Material World. If we add up the cluster of all 
the small rocks, we get the Holy Number 8, the duality of the Tetractys in

353
MY FATHER
manifestation in the three lower worlds. By adding the two (2) huge 
cliffs we come to Number 10, signalling the completion of the Great 
Work – the grouping and mixing of the first Ten (10) Holy Numbers.
The  different  patterns  of  motion  suggest  the  various  states  of  
BE-ing and Existence: As far as the seagulls are concerned the motion 
is  from  left  to  right,  from  Number  3  to  Numbers  4  and  finally  2.  
The  waves  breaking  on  the  shore  move  back  and  forth,  whereas  the  
Divine  Realms  (the  sky  and  especially  the  distant  horizon)  dwell  in  
magnificent  and  glorious  colour-lights,  not  presenting  any  apparent  
movement.
What  a  lesson!  The  Symbol  of  Life  at  work  in  Creation,  and  a  
solemn  proof  that  Father  was  fully  aware  of  Its  Great  Truths  at  an  
early age, well before presenting them to the public.

Volcano

355
MY FATHER
F
ATHER  was  totally  aware  of  all  his  previous  incarnations.  By  
entering  the  Eternal  Present,  he  gained  full  access  to  ‘all  times.’  
Consequently,  he  was  able  to  attune  himself  to  the  living  Book  of  
Life, kept by the Soul, and bring back memories from the past to the 
present.
This  volcano  derives  from  his  very  first  incarnation  on  planet  
Earth. At that time huge volcanoes were constantly erupting, creating 
havoc on the surface of the Earth. The element of Fire in cooperation 
with the element of Water forged the new planet - as it still does today. 
In the eyes of the uninitiated, the cooperation of these two seemingly 
competing elements looks inconceivable, but the mystic can recognise 
its  importance  in  the  transmutation  of  the  fiery  ball  called  planet  
Earth, into a habitable planet.
Observe  the  rivers  of  lava  bursting  out  of  the  guts  of  the  Earth,  
creating  a  thick  atmosphere  of  smog.  We  also  witness  the  symbolic  
manifestation of Mind as the mighty element of Fire. 
Daskalos,  being  a  Son  of  Fire,  obviously  created  this  painting  
not only in reminiscence of his first incarnation, but because he was 
especially fond of the Element of Fire and its Ministers, the Archangels 
Michaels. He could easily observe and attune himself to Fire in all its 
aspects and expressions: microcosmically in the atom, mesocosmically 
on planet Earth and in the Sun, and macrocosmically in the multitude 
of the galaxies and in all the multi-dimensional Universes.

N this sentimental painting we observe a lake which is the Psycho-
Noetical World. Dressed in a white garment (purity), a ballet dancer 
(the  present-day  personality)  has  just  finished  her  dance  and  bows  
in reverence, resting peacefully on the ground by the lake (the Gross 
Material World). A great white swan (the immaculate Soul-Ego Self ) 
covers with love and affection the young female dancer who has just 
successfully concluded her performance (incarnation) on Earth.
In the background, on the left hand side, we spot three (3) cypress 
trees (the Holy Trinity in Manifestation) and on the right hand side 
two  (2)  other  cypress  trees  (the  Law  of  Duality  and  Separateness),  
discretely blessing and protecting the present-day personality, but yet 
they are not interfering in the free will of the Self.
Under  the  guidance  of  the  Soul,  the  dancer  dwells  in  peace,  joy  
and upliftment and is ready to move on towards the next part of the 
same incarnation, that will take place in the worlds of the fourth and 
fifth dimension and even beyond.

HIS  painting  depicts  a  misty,  serene  psycho-noetical  scene  in  
shades of green, the colour of regeneration and rejuvenation. The 
Sun,  representing  the  Noetical  World,  discretely  sheds  its  dim  light  
over the whole scene. The pond (the Element of Water) symbolises the 
Psychical World, the dusk cypress trees are the individual shells of the 
personalities on this plane. The burnt bush indicates that everything 
that takes place here is under the influence of the Law of Duality and 
Separateness.
When  I  expressed  my  admiration  for  the  vibrant  colours  and  
the  calmness  reigning  in  the  scenery,  my  father  exclaimed  smiling,  
“You know, this scene describes a hell environment. Hell is not as we 
conceive of it, but a place of comfort and peace for those recovering 
from  the  ailments  they  have  inflicted  upon  themselves  during  their  
lifetime  on  the  gross  material  Earth.  The  mist  we  see  is  the  all  
embracing Archangelic Love. God Is indeed Merciful!”

Lilies

359
MY FATHER
F
ATHER  was  fond  of  flowers  and  in  particular  lilies,  all  sorts  of  
lilies. On our birthday he used to offer my sister and me a bouquet 
of  flowers,  dominated  by  lilies.  Frequently,  he  urged  us  to  meditate  
on lilies and exercise observation, visualisation and will – the divine 
aspects of the Soul.
Here,  overall  six  (6)  lilies  are  depicted.  Three  (3)  of  them,  with  
the  red-yellow  stem,  combine  to  form  an  upward  pointing  triangle,  
representing  one  aspect  of  Absolute  BE-ingness:  the  Holy  Trinity  as  
the Father, the Son-Logos and the Holy Spirit. The other three (3) lilies 
form  a  downward  pointing  triangle,  symbolising  the  manifestation  
of Absolute BE-ingness God in Itself, as Omniscience, Omnipotence 
and  Pan  Universal  Love  in  Creation.  All  lilies  are  grouped  together,  
forming one big trunk, the Oneness of God. 
My  father  loved  colours  and  especially  green,  the  colour  of  
rejuvenation and creation. There is a decrescendo of the luminosity of 
the painting, the bottom part being more luminous. It is suggested that 
all lilies are born out of this eternal everlasting Light, the inconceivable 
Nature of God...

HIS  painting  depicts  the  Godman  Joshua  Immanuel  the  Christ  
talking to the two disciples, Luke the Evangelist and Cleopas, on 
the road to Emmaus as follows:
“And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called 
Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs. And they 
talked together of all these things which had happened. And it came to 
pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself 
drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they 
should not know him.
And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these 
that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? And the one of 
them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only 
a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come 
to pass there in these days?
On the Way to Emmaus

361
MY FATHER
And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, 
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and 
word before God and all the people: And how the chief priests and our 
rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: 
and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. 
Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which 
were early at the sepulchre; And when they found not his body, they 
came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said 
that he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the 
sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they 
saw not.
Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all 
that the prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to have suffered these 
things, and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all 
the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things 
concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they 
went: and he made as though he would have gone further. But they 
constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and 
the day is far spent.
And he went in to tarry with them. And it came to pass, as he sat 
at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to 
them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished 
out of their sight. And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn 
within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to 
us the scriptures?
And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and 
found  the  eleven  gathered  together,  and  them  that  were  with  them,  
Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. And 
they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of 
them in breaking of bread. And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood 
in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you” (Luke 
24:13-36).

Our Last Trip
I
N the spring of 1994 my father and I travelled to Europe, the United 
States and Brazil to lecture. It was a very long and demanding trip. 
During the lengthy flight time, Father used to take small naps or ate 
scarcely.  Other  times  he  sank  into  his  thoughts,  but  mainly  he  was  
talking  to  me,  giving  me  advice  and  guiding  me.  I  was  under  the  
impression  that  he  was  about  to  depart  and  that  he  wanted  me  to  
pay  attention  to  certain  things.  I  patiently  listened  to  him,  curious  
to see where all these talks would eventually lead. After some hours, 
I  interrupted  him  saying,  “Father  why  are  you  telling  me  all  these  
things? Are you going somewhere without me, and is this the reason 
that you are giving me these instructions?”
He looked at me intensely and said in a profound and stern voice, 
“My  love,  I  want  you  to  know  that  this  is  my  last  trip.”  “Okay,”  I  
answered, “I realise that it is very tiring for you to travel, but this was 
your decision and not mine. From now on we will stay in Cyprus.” He 
smiled and added, “You don’t understand, I want you to know that I 
have almost completed the cycle of my life; it is time for me to go.”
Suddenly, I felt that my heart would stop. I lost my voice, I felt that 
my voice was driven down to my stomach. I opened my mouth to talk, 
but I was not able to articulate a word. I started to breathe deeply and 
rhythmically for a few minutes because I wanted my voice to be steady 
and calm for when I would talk. After recomposing myself from the 
initial shock caused by his announcement, I dared to comment, ‘What 
are you telling me now? Please do not scare me.”
In my desperate effort to conceal my fear, I knowingly behaved in a 
careless manner: “Do you want me to take up all your responsibilities 
towards all people and our family? Sorry father, but it is a very heavy 
cross  that  you  want  to  put  on  my  shoulders.”  He  smiled  and  in  the  
same way he added, “I am sure, dearest, that your shoulders are very 
strong.” Then, he closed his eyes pretending that he wanted to sleep. I 
knew that he intended to give me ample time to digest all that he had 
said to me. I also closed my eyes but for another reason. I did not want 
anyone to see the tears coming out of my eyes, and be humiliated on 
the plane.

363
MY FATHER
For  some  days  my  father  did  not  mention  anything  about  our  
conversation on the plane, so I dared to relax a bit, silently reassuring 
myself  that  the  whole  issue  was  over.  Eventually,  we  arrived  in  Sao  
Paulo, Brazil. A great deal of work awaited us there. We had to see our 
Sao Paulo group and talk with scores of people. The two lady Group 
Leaders  organised  the  lectures  and  meditations  in  a  flawless  way.  
When  our  work  was  concluded,  Father  said  to  me,  “Now,  I  want  to  
relax. You can go with the two ladies to visit three foundations of your 
choice  and  donate  the  money  we  had  from  the  work.”  I  did  it  with  
pleasure. This is a story I will tell you another time.
The  next  day  some  friends  invited  us  to  spend  the  day  at  their  
mansion. It was a beautiful house on a hill with a breathtaking view 
of the surrounding mountains and the vast sea lying under our feet. 
There were so many beautiful sweet-smelling flowers and exotic trees 
in their garden. My father thoroughly enjoyed the exotic juices and the 
variety of delicious food and delicacies, that were strange to us. He felt 
very happy in that distant country.
On the plane, during our return to Cyprus, he talked to me again, 
in such a way that until this day the memory remains vividly engraved 
in  my  mind.  It  was  a  request,  as  he  said:  “My  dearest,  when  I  leave  
my material body, I wish you and Rena to sit nearby me and listen to 
Ludwig van Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9- ‘Ode to Joy.’ I want both of 
you to listen carefully to this Symphony and get my message. Can you 
promise this to me? Oh, and something else. I do not want you and 
Rena to be dressed in black for my funeral, but in white.”
I tried to control myself and did not allow tears to flood my eyes, 
so I tried to smile and said, “Father, I want to fulfill your request, but 
do  you  want  us  to  be  headlines  in  the  newspapers  in  Cyprus,  when  
people  will  observe  this  odd  dressing  code?  He  looked  at  me  and  
consented, “Okay, but do fulfill my other request.” “Okay Father, but 
you have many years ahead to live,” I answered awkwardly. 
On  August  26,  1995,  my  father  left  his  gross  material  body.  On  
the  next  day  we  brought  him  to  his  house,  so  that  his  friends  and  
neighbours would address the customary last farewell to him. On that 
day  I  fulfilled  his  final  wish.  My  sister  and  I  listened  to  Beethoven’s  
Symphony No. 9 - ‘Ode to Joy,’ together with him! I never asked my 
sister what message she got from him. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
364
Nevertheless, the message I received from him was a whole lecture. 
If I was to summarise it in one sentence, it would be,
 “At last, I am 
free again.” Indeed an ‘Ode to Joy!’
A  complex  sacred  symbol  depicting  the  Winged  Scarab  transporting  the  
Liberated  Soul  of  the  departed,  via  the  Cosmic  Gate  of  the  two  Pillars  of  
Creation, towards the Winged Sun Disc. The golden cartouche in the centre 
of  the  symbol  bears  the  name  of  the  deceased.  This  angelic  elemental  
illustrates  the  process  of  Resurrection  of  the  Immortal  Soul.  The  Scarab  
is  the  symbol  of  Becoming  and  of  Creation,  while  the  Winged  Sun  Disc  
represents God as the Life-giving Light.

365
A Prayer
I 
should like to conclude with a prayer and a short meditation. The 
prayer  is  the  Lord’s  Prayer,  which  my  father  always  recited  before  
a lecture. Yiohannan had given him a slightly amended version with 
an  additional  stanza.  The  meditation  is  a  meditation  which  Joshua  
Immanuel the Christ gave in the synagogue of the Essene Brotherhood 
to his disciples, before sending them into the world to work as teachers 
and healers:
Our Father Who Art in Heaven,
Hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our transgressions
as we forgive those who transgress against us.
And lead us while in temptation
and deliver us from evil,
for Thine is the Kingdom
and the Power and the Glory, forever and ever.
Absolute Infinite BE-ingness, God;
Everlasting Life, Love and Mercy;
Manifesting Yourself in Yourself,
as the Total Wisdom and the Almightiness;
Enlighten our minds to understand You as the Truth.
Clean our hearts to reflect Your Love towards You 
and towards all other Human Beings.
Amen

366
A Meditation
R
ELAX completely. Visualise Joshua Immanuel the Christ standing 
before you as you sit peacefully, listening. In perfect ‘At-one-ment’ 
with  His  Divine  Self,  the  Logos,  and  attuned  with  each  and  every  
Human Being, Joshua spreads out His arms and says:
“All of you listen! You are my Children, my Offspring. I am in you 
as God, as the Absolute BE-ingness, your real Self, and you are always 
in  Me  as  gods.  And  I  am  also  with  you  as  a  Human  Being,  as  your  
Loving Father, within Our Loving Father.
Every breath you take, sustaining the life of your material body, 
is  a  fatherly  kiss  of  mine  for  you.  My  beloved  ones,  I  will  not  only  
speak to you in words of any language, but I will also come to you as 
inspiration and as sensation.
I am the heat, which keeps your body alive. I am the breeze, the 
fresh air that caresses your face. I am in your eyes – as your sight – 
allowing you to enjoy my works around you, as phenomena of Life. I 
am sight and I see all.
I am unceasingly creating Mind substance for you, to keep your 
bodies  thriving.  I  am  the  living  ‘Bread  of  Life.’  And  I  am  the  Living  
Water,  which  you  will  drink  and  never  thirst  again.  I  am  the  Mind  
Vitality everywhere in the world. I am Spirit and I am form. You are 
in my Omnipresence.
I  am  the  voice  of  wisdom  in  your  minds  that  speaks  to  you  
when you are doing something, which is not right; not rebuking but 
awakening  you.  For  I  am  reason  in  your  thoughts  and  I  am  love  in  
your heart.
Cast  away  from  your  heart  every  bitter  emotion,  all  enmity  and  
any cruelty you may harbour. I am the Life in you. Enjoy my Life. You 
are my Offspring, you are my flesh and blood, a part of myself.
I Love you. Love all my expressions, love all other Human Beings 
as your own self and love all of Life as I have loved you and as I will 
always Love you.”

367
The Pillars of Daskalos’ Teachings
I
F  I  was  to  give  a  summary  of  my  father’s  teachings  to  me  in  just  
a  few  words,  it  would  be  
“Unconditional  Love,  Wake-up  and  
Freedom.”
 He made me realise that every thought, good or bad, comes 
back to me. Mind emanates from God and this holy substance is used 
in  various  frequencies  of  vibration.  It  ranges  from  Super-Light,  to  
psycho-noetical  super-matter  and  substance,  down  to  gross  matter,  
which is Mind in solid form. He taught me how to properly use the 
Mind, granted by God to us, as a thinking and reasoning personality. 
Father  strongly  recommended  the  use  of  the  divine  gift  of  
observation. By practicing careful observation of ourselves, of Nature 
and  the  Universes,  we  can  draw  important  conclusions.  We  will,  
for  example,  see  that  everything  has  been  created  by  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness and Its Holy Archangels in Total Wisdom and Total Power. 
“Be aware of the Divine Spark in the smallest thing in Creation,” he 
said.
By  learning  to  observe  carefully  and  to  concentrate  fully,  proper  
visualisation becomes easier. All of us visualise subconsciously while 
creating  elementals.  This  is  how  we  build  our  world.  Our  thoughts  
are  most  powerful  and  visualisation  is  the  process  of  using  thought  
consciously  in  a  constructive  manner,  either  for  the  expansion  of  
consciousness or to help others in need.
My  father  used  to  emphasise,  “Be  the  master  of  your  thoughts,  
feelings and emotions, and not their slave! Reduce the egoism of your 
personality, love God and love all Human Beings. This is the key to 
health and happiness for a healthy and happy life.” 
I learnt, I understood and I found my place in what we call life. 
I  know  that  I  am  an  eternal  Spirit-Soul-Ego  Self,  and  I  recognise  
and study my duality in the Worlds of Existence. I know what Mind 
Vitality is. 
I have found out who I am, how I can use Mind Vitality and how I 
was misusing it. I observed how Mind is used as thought, emotion and 
desire. In introspection or looking within, I studied how I was using 
Mind Vitality and what I was doing as a time and place personality. 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
368
Was  I  acting  as  the  slave  of  desires  and  uncontrolled  emotions,  
storing  them  in  my  subconscious  and  separating  myself  from  the  
Oneness  of  God?  Alternatively,  did  I  see  things  as  they  were,  using  
Mind properly as right thinking, correcting things and becoming the 
master of situations? 
In  this  way,  I  separated  my  Self  from  its  shadow.  Checking,  
observing,  understanding  and  reaching  decisions  for  being  able  to  
control a situation, is a great gain indeed!
The greatest gain of all is when we acquire Soul Self-Awareness. 
Then, we can spread out over a large space and contain within ourselves 
villages, cities and even whole countries or the entire planet. We can 
know everything that is happening, and we can know everything about 
other Human Beings and all other expressions of Life in the space we 
live  in  and  perceive,  which  is  contained  within  us.  With  these  new  
powers of attunement and ‘At-one-ment,’ our Self-Awareness is fuller; 
it  is  in  the  very  least  and  in  the  highest.  It  is  what  I  call  complete  
freedom.
The Holy Gifts
As I was about to conclude this first volume of my book, a word 
kept  buzzing  in  my  head;  ‘The  gifts,  the  gifts...’  Indeed,  numerous  
were the spiritual gifts bestowed upon me by my father. I just want to 
enumerate  some  of  what  he  taught  me  that  lead  directly  to  absolute  
attunement with Truth: 
1. How to love unconditionally.
2. How to find my Real Self.
3. How to make my whole life a prayer.
4. How to be a humble person.
5. How   to   live   self-consciously,   be   self-aware   and   avoid   
living  subconsciously.  Christ  called  the  people  who  lead  a  
subconscious life, ‘The Dead.’
6. How to know what Divine Mercy and Faith are.

369
MY FATHER
7. How  to  cooperate  with  the  Divine  Plan  and  obey  the  Divine  
Laws of the different Worlds.
8. How to know who and what is ‘The Way, the Truth and the 
Life.’
9. How to go about a self-analysis of my present-day personality 
(Introspection),  focusing  on  the  correction  of  my  mistakes,  
whilst  avoiding  the  common  pitfalls  of  any  masochistic  
tendencies that lead to self-deprecation.
10. How to observe, concentrate, visualise and meditate in order to 
reach reason and contemplation.
11. How  to  develop  my  personality  and  allow  it  to  gradually  
assimilate with my Soul-Self.
12. How to harmonise my bodies: The body of thoughts with the 
body  of  emotions  and  in  this  way  allow  my  Self  to  keep  my  
material body under control.
13. How to use Mind Super-Substance.
14. How to create positive Angelic elementals and not evil ones.
15. How to annihilate the egoism of my personality.
16. God  created  us  according  to  ‘His  Image  and  Likeness.’  
Consequently,  we  must  develop  our  personality  so  that  one  
day we become perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect.
For these gifts I will be eternally grateful to him. I also thank from 
the  depths  of  my  soul  the  Almighty  Absolute  BE-ingness  who  has  
utilised  my  father  as  His  instrument  throughout  his  incarnations.  I  
promise  that  in  the  next  volume  of  this  book  I  will  present  all  the  
above in depth.
‘The  Truth  is  a  brilliant,  many-sided  diamond.  The  Great  Light  of  the  
Absolute  Infinite  BE-ingness  fills  this  gem  and  colours  gleam  from  every  
side.  Mystics,  messengers,  sages  and  teachers  of  all  ages,  races  and  beliefs  
have spoken of a different face of this common Eternal Truth.’ Daskalos

According to Daskalos, St. Paul wrote the Hymn of Love 
under direct Archangelic guidance and inspiration.

A Message from Daskalos on the 12-12-2012
A Centennial from His Birth
“A
LL of you must know who you are. You must know where you 
come from. 
 You have to know your position in the Worlds of Creation. You 
have to know where you are going. You have to know the purpose 
of the Divine Plan.
 You have to become the master of your way instead of being the 
slave of matter, feeling dizzy from the intoxication of matter.
 You  have  to  become  the  master  of  your  surroundings  instead  of  
resembling a small boat in a stormy ocean, as most people in your 
society are.
 You have to know the Law of Cause and its effects.
 You have to know what the real expression of your Self is. What 
are you as a time and place expression?
 You  have  to  know  what  unconditional  Love  is.  No  illusions,  no  
time and place pettiness for you anymore.
 You have to know that God IS in Divine Self-Sufficiency and Bliss.
 You have to know the Truth that will set you free from ignorance 
and pain.
 When I say pain, I mean the pain that is mixed with ignorance. This 
kind of pain leads to despair, rage, anger, attacks and confusion. It 
is the pain you see around you every day.
 Of course, you are not free from pain and sorrow over what you 
see  happening  all  around  you  and  in  the  whole  world.  You  will  
feel sorrow. Even the beloved Christ felt pain and sorrow. When 
you  feel  it,  you  should  know  that  it  is  a  necessary  condition  to  
wake people up. In reality this feeling is beneficial for the people 
around you, so you should not call it sorrow.

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
374
 You have to realise who you really are, and you have to know and 
see your expressions always through the prism of Total Love. 
 You have to understand the quality of real WILL. You must be able 
to separate human obstinacy from WILL, and be free from time 
and  place  pettiness  that  give  birth  to  obstinacy.  Your  real  WILL  
gives you always the cause and the effect, and you will realise the 
purpose, which is none other than the Divine Plan. 
 This is the development of the Human Being. And in time you will 
know  it,  Children  of  Fire  and  Spirit,  Children  of  Fire  and  Total  
Love. 
 For the first time you will know Total Love as Heavenly Fire. And 
you will also know other qualities of Total Love. 
 You are Children of Total Love, Fire and Spirit, Children of true 
reasoning,  of  right  and  constructive  thinking  under  the  Divine  
WILL of the Absolute BE-ingness.
 Saint  Paul  said,  ‘Quench  not  the  Spirit.’  Therefore,  do  not  allow  
the  Spirit  within  you  to  be  extinguished.  When  Saint  Paul  was  
uttering  these  words  he  did  not  mean  the  everyday  thoughts,  
intelligence and knowledge of his time. He meant the Spirit and 
Love.
In a slow and steady manner, you will receive the Baptism of Fire. 
Let us hope you may receive it before you leave your material body. If 
you have received the Baptism of Fire in your previous lives, you will 
acknowledge it and feel it. For all those who have not obtained it in 
prior lives, I wish them to receive it now. 
But pay attention. You have to prepare yourselves for the Baptism of 
Fire. This Fire gives exaltation and bliss, which lead to Self-Sufficiency 
to the one who is far from time and place pettiness conditions such as 
malice, weaknesses and ‘sins.’ In other words, to the one who is not 
violating the Divine Laws. Be prepared to get rid of all that. During the 
Baptism of Fire all will be burned. Nevertheless, when you receive the 
Baptism of Fire and you have a lot to burn, you will feel pain. 
I hope and wish you will not feel pain because this pain is going 
to  be  an  intense  memory.  Maybe,  there  are  events  in  your  life  that  
you  have  to  reconcile  with  your  Inner  Self.  Hence,  be  prepared,  the  
Baptism of Fire gives exaltation and Bliss, but also pain!

375
A MESSAGE FROM DASKALOS
You  may  think,  ‘Blessed  be  this  pain  if  it  will  burn  what  must  
be  burned,  and  if  it  will  help  me  to  be  free  from  certain  conditions  
and lead me to Theosis.’ I agree with you, but why not send away all 
these undesirable conditions before they get hold of you? I hope you 
understand what I mean.
As for me, when the time comes for your Baptism of Fire, and later 
your Baptism in Spirit, I will be near to help you cleanse and purify 
yourself and reach perfection. I will help you so that you will not have 
much  to  burn,  so  as  to  avoid  unnecessary  pain.  Instead,  you  shall  
experience a pleasure that will lead you to bliss. 
I leave my blessings to you, to your families and to your children. 
I  have  something  to  add:  No  matter  where  you  are,  no  matter  what  
you do, you are always within our Elder Brethren in Heaven and me, 
because We as Self-conscious Selves embrace a great deal of space from 
within Us; and the planet is small, extremely small. So, We are always 
with you all. Never dare to believe that you are alone, irrespective of 
where you are. We are fully aware of the difficulties you come across 
in your life. But, remember that the current tribulations, and those to 
come, only aim to give you valuable lessons on the phenomena of Life. 
Difficulties make you strong, so that you may overcome them.
We are standing by you in Spirit as Helpers, always!”

Glossary of Basic Terms



393
Glossary of Basic Terms
ABSOLUTE BE-INGNESS, ABSOLUTE BE-NESS, ABSOLUTE INFINITE 
BE-INGNESS, GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, GOD THE FATHER, THE LORD, 
THE HIGHEST, ALAHA (in Aramaic)
These  terms  are  used  interchangeably  to  denote  the  all-encompassing  
ONE  SPIRIT-GOD,  the  ABSOLUTE  EVERLASTING  LIFE.  The  ONE  
BE-ING  consisting  of  BE-ings  beyond  any  number.  What  we  know  of  
God we see only in reflection, as evident both externally and internally. 
Love,  Light  and  Life  that  belong  to  the  Primary  Nature  of  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness are manifested as Total Love, Total Wisdom and Almightiness. 
The Love of God is universal, ceaseless, and unconditional. It is the Love 
of God, expressed as Grace, which lies at the core of Creation. The Light is 
pure, luminous Super Self-consciousness. Everlasting Life is the eternal 
motion,  generation  and  regeneration  of  Creation.  Absolute  BE-ingness  
is  Omnipresent,  Omnipotent,  Omniscient  and  Omnibenevolent.  Its  
characteristics   include   Multiplicity,   Self-sufficiency,   and   the   Will-
pleasure  to  express  Itself  in  Itself  as  Creation.  Absolute  BE-ingness  
manifests Itself as the Pan-Universal Christ Logos and the Pan-Universal 
Holy Spirit – The Holy Trinity: ‘And these Three are One’ (First Epistle of 
John 5:7). Yet, there is an aspect of God which lies absolutely beyond the 
reach of Human and Archangelic comprehension. The Ultimate Source, 
the  fathomless  and  inarticulate  depths  of  the  Divine  that  are  beyond  
expression,  for  ‘No  man  hath  seen  God  at  any  time’  (First  Epistle  of  
John  4:12).  Daskalos  occasionally  employed  the  term  Absolute  BE-ness  
to  describe  this  Static  State  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness.  In  spite  of  the  
occasional use of masculine pronouns with some of the above terms (i.e. 
the Father), Absolute BE-ingness and any of the other expressions used 
for God are without gender. God is All and Everything.
ARCHANGELS, ANGELS
Archangels are Logoic and Holy-Spiritual BE-ings, the Co-creators with 
the Holy Trinity. They build, maintain and bless the Universes. Within 
Absolute  BE-ingness  are  Orders  of  Archangels,  each  Order  containing  
billions  upon  billions  of  Holy-Monadic  BE-ings  of  the  same  kind.  
We  know  of  Twelve  Archangelic  Orders  some  of  which  are:  Thrones,  
Authorities, Dominions, Principalities, Overlords, Seraphim, Cherubim, 
the Archangels of the Elements and many others, named and unnamed. 
They  possess  Total  Wisdom,  Total  Love,  Total  Power,  and  Absolute  
Super-Consciousness and Super-Conscious Self-awareness. In our work 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
394
on the Symbol of Life, we speak of Seven Orders of Archangels serving 
Creation. Angels are elementals of the Archangels.
AT-ONE-MENT
The Super Self-conscious state in which a BE-ing merges into complete 
unity with any other BE-ing or Existence, and with the Absolute BE-ingness 
in Theosis, without ever abandoning its Self-conscious Ego.
ATTUNEMENT
Adjusting our vibrations to the frequency of any other Existence or BE-ing, 
to  the  extent  that  we  can  observe  and  study  its  nature.  Attunement  is  
reached prior to At-one-ment.
BE-ING AND EXISTING
BE-ing is our Divine Nature, boundless and eternal Spirit. Existing, as a 
projection  of  BE-ing,  is  within  the  boundaries  of  time  and  space-place.  
An existence is a temporal phenomenon with a beginning and an end.
CAUSAL STATES
Above the Noetic State, the Causal States are non-dual conditions of pure 
Love,  Causes,  Laws,  and  Principles,  cared  for  by  the  higher  echelons  of  
the Archangelic Orders. They pertain to the Fifth Heaven and above.
CAUSE AND EFFECT, LAW OF
The  Law  of  Cause  and  Effect  is  recognised  by  scientists,  as  well  as  
mystics.  This  Divine  Law  of  growth,  harmony  and  balance,  requires  
action  to  result  in  a  reaction.  Every  deed,  thought  and  emotion  has  a  
consequence,  either  favourable  or  detrimental.  Karma,  a  term  from  the  
East,  is  the  accumulation  of  the  ‘effects’.  Yet,  whereas  Eastern  religions  
often teach a deterministic view of this Law, we believe that debts can be 
borne for others or transcended through repentance and reparation. This 
Law operates in an unpredictable way amenable to God’s Will, Love and 
Mercy over several lifetimes, as well as within much shorter periods of 
time.
CAUSES AND IDEAS
Absolute  BE-ingness  is  the  Primal  Cause.  The  Will-pleasure  of  the  
Absolute  BE-ingness  is  the  Cause  of  Creation.  From  within  the  Will-
Pleasure of Absolute BE-ingness, all subordinate Causes spring. Causes 
cooperate  with  Ideas,  in  order  to  bring  forth  the  multitude  of  Divine  
Forms residing unexpressed in them. Hence, each Form is dressed with 
Mind  in  various  degrees  of  vibration  and  gives  birth  to  a  cascade  of  
living forms that come into existence: the noetic, noetical, psychical and 
gross material form. Archangels work through the Ideas and apply Total 

395
GLOSSARY OF BASIC TERMS
Wisdom,  Total  Love  and  Total  Power  to  each  Form.  Every  Idea  holds  
within it the whole Circle of Possibility and Probabilities of a particular 
Form to be manifested. Also see PRINCIPLES AND LAWS, DIVINE.
CIRCLE OF POSSIBILITIES
Each  form  contains  a  Principle  known  as  the  Circle  of  Possibility.  
This  Principle  delineates  with  Total  Wisdom  all  the  expressions  of  the  
phenomena  of  Life.  All  manifested  forms  are  continually  developing:  
from seed to tree, from fetus to adult. Life requires change, movement, so 
that experience may be gathered from the many perspectives of a Circle. 
Each form changes in appearance, though never in essence, as the Circles 
of Possibilities are immutable in the Eternal Now. No form can escape its 
individual Circle of Possibility, thus ruling out transmigration from one 
form to another (e.g. Humans will always reincarnate as Humans).
CIRCLE OF PROBABILITIES
While  a  Circle  of  Possibility  is  inescapable,  the  Principle  of  its  Circle  
of  Probabilities  allows  for  a  vast  array  of  occurrences.  For  Man  is  free  
to choose the course of his life, a seed may or may not germinate, and a 
young tree may flourish or become diseased and die. Within each Circle 
of Possibility, we find millions of probabilities. 
COMMON   SELFHOOD,   LOGOIC   COMMON   SELF,   CHRISTO-ENO-
AESTHESIA
As present-day personalities, we may come into conflict with one another 
and  the  gulf  between  us  may  seem  unbreachable,  but  in  our  Common  
Logoic Consciousness we are unified and indivisible. This is what Joshua 
Immanuel the Christ taught when He emphatically said, ‘At that day ye 
shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you’ (John 
14:20), and ‘I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and 
I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do 
nothing’ (John 15:5).
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, COSMIC MEMORY
In  the  Cosmic  Consciousness  every  event,  past  and  present,  in  all  the  
Universes, is recorded and preserved. Within the Cosmic Consciousness 
is the Cosmic Memory (also known in Sanskrit as the Akashic Records). 
The  Cosmic  Memory  is  achieved  by  the  inherent  capacity  of  Mind  to  
perpetually  record  everything  that  takes  place  in  the  Eternal  Now.  
This  is  the  ‘Heavenly  Archive’  where  impressions,  actions,  thoughts,  
emotions, and desires are chronicled. By attuning himself to the Cosmic 
Consciousness a mystic can - within the limits of his own development 
- enter and study the Cosmic Memory. Nothing is lost or dies within the 
Absolute BE-ingness!

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
396
CREATION
The manifestation of the Absolute BE-ingness in Itself as the Universes, 
from the Highest Heavens to the Worlds of Existence. All of Creation is 
in accordance with Its Divine Plan, under the auspices of the Holy Spirit 
and the Pan-Universal Christ Logos.
DIVINE MEDITATION
Intricately linked to the Will-pleasure of Absolute BE-ingness to express 
Itself within Itself. Divine Meditation, for lack of a better term, is believed 
to  be  the  state  prior  to  Creation,  in  which  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  
contemplates expressing Itself within Itself. However, the ‘Divine Paradox’ 
that there has never been a time when there was no Creation manifested, 
is understood if we realise that the perception of time is an illusion. There 
Is only the Eternal Present, the Perpetual Now.
DIVINE PLAN
The blueprint of Creation, perfect and complete, accounting for everything 
and for all occurrences. Attuning ourselves to the most wise Divine Plan 
of Absolute BE-ingness is the purpose of our existence.
ECSTASY
A State of BE-ingness. Entering the Kingdom of the Heavens within us 
through expansion of consciousness and Self-awareness, attunement and 
at-one-ment.  Ecstasy  is  of  the  Spirit  as  it  implies  a  passing  beyond  all  
conceptual thinking and the confines of time and space-place.
EGO AND EGOISM
Our  use  of  these  terms  is  not  to  be  confused  with  contemporary  
psychological    terminology.    Egoism    misuses    Mind    through    the    
construction of selfish desires and base emotions, like greed, malice, and 
envy. The Ego with capital E, is the Self as BE-ing, our Self-aware Soul, 
and is reflected in a reasoning and loving personality. Egoism is the sum-
total of all self-centred, unbridled elementals and the source of disease in 
Man, in the nations and on the planet. Our Ego nature brings forth love, 
compassion, reasoned thinking and reasoned action.
ELEMENTALS
Every  thought,  emotion,  and  desire  -  both  conscious  and  subconscious  
-  create  and  transmit  an  elemental,  a  thought-form,  that  carry  on  an  
existence  of  its  own.  We  create  and  regenerate  two  types  of  elementals.  
When negative emotion prevails over thought, we have created emotional 
thought-forms, or desire-thoughts. When our ideas, desires, and emotions 
pass  through  reason  and  love,  we  create  reasoned  thought-forms  or  
thought-desires. Once created, an elemental can never be destroyed, only 

397
GLOSSARY OF BASIC TERMS
de-energised  –  when  no  longer  fed  with  Etheric  Vitality.  Elementals  of  
a kind collect to form powerful group elementals. If an individual, or a 
collection  of  individuals,  are  vibrating  at  a  certain  frequency,  they  will  
attract such elementals. Archangels also create elementals in the service 
of the Divine Plan (that are named angels and nature spirits).
ETERNAL NOW, ETERNAL PRESENT
Time and place are concepts resulting from, and sustained by impressions 
generated in the Worlds of Separateness. These concepts and the respective 
experience, vary from one dimension to the next. The Worlds of Existence 
are  contained  within  the  higher  Heavens  of  the  Eternal  Present.  The  
experiences we have in the Worlds of Existence are but a slice from the 
larger whole, the state of Everlasting Life, where past, present, and future 
collapse into the Eternal Now.
ETHEREAL WORLD
The etheric double of the Gross Material, Psychical and Noetical Worlds. 
We  apply  the  term  ‘Ethereal’  which  is  a  noun  to  describe  the  World  
composed  of  Etheric  Vitality,  whereas  ‘Etheric’  being  an  adjective  is  
used to denote everything that is living in this World. ‘Etheric’ is energy, 
‘Ethereal’ is quality.
ETHERIC CENTRES
Centres  of  energy  (Sanskrit: Chakras)  located  at  various  points  on  the  
etheric doubles of our bodies. These centres act as gates and storehouses 
for  elementals.  Each  of  the  three  bodies,  from  the  gross  material  to  the  
more  refined,  displays  these  centres  on  its  etheric  double:  ‘Stars’  shine  
on  the  noetical  body,  ‘Lamps’  light  the  psychical  body,  and  ‘Churches’ 
sanctify the material body via its etheric double.
ETHERIC DOUBLES OR COUNTERPARTS
All manifested forms, from the simplest to the most complex structures, 
possess  an  etheric  double,  centred  in  the  body  and  extending  slightly  
around  it.  The  etheric  doubles,  both  perfect  and  incorruptible,  serve  as  
the  mould  for  construction  and  for  the  preservation  of  a  body’s  health.  
We  have  an  etheric  double  for  each  one  of  our  bodies  (gross  material,  
psychical  and  noetical).  These  three  etheric  doubles,  yet  one,  cooperate  
and  interconnect  our  bodies  amongst  them,  so  as  to  behave  in  unity.  
Within  the  etheric  doubles  Etheric  Vitality  is  received  and  distributed  
to  the  various  parts  of  our  bodies.  An  etheric  double  exists  as  long  as  
a  body  (whether  material,  psychical  or  noetical)  is  projected.  A  body  
passes-over  (dies)  when  the  connection  with  its  etheric  double  is  
severed. Then, the detached etheric counterpart gradually dissolves into 
the etheric planet.

398
ETHERIC VITALITY, MIND VITALITY
Our  ‘Daily  Bread’,  Etheric  Vitality  (Mind  at  certain  frequencies)  is  
obtained  from  all  sort  of  cosmic  rays,  the  sun,  breathing,  meditation,  
food and liquids. We swim in a sea of Etheric Vitality which surrounds 
and permeates the globe, giving life and nourishment to all phenomena.
ETHERS
Within the etheric doubles we find Etheric Vitality in Four conditions, yet 
One: as the Creative, Imprinting, Aesthetic, and Kinetic ethers. Creative 
ether  is  used  in  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  all  phenomena  
of  Life.  Imprinting  ether  is  used  to  shape  Etheric  Vitality  into  psycho-
noetical images. Aesthetic ether is the ‘feeling giving’ ether, and Kinetic 
ether facilitates motion and movement.
EXOSOMATOSIS
A Greek word equivalent to the English expression ‘out of body’. We know 
of a first (from the material body), a second (from the psychical body) and 
a third (from the noetical body) exosomatosis. We all leave our bodies at 
night, during sleep, and travel to other planes subconsciously. The aim, 
however, is to be self-conscious while out of body. 
FAITH
Not only a theoretical belief in the dogmatic truths of a religion, but an 
all-embracing  relationship,  a  recognition  of,  and  love  for  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness. Faith, above all, is an active virtue for ‘Even so Faith, if it 
hath not works, is dead, being alone’ (Epistle of James 2:17).
FORMS AND ARCHETYPES
Anything,  in  order  to  exist,  needs  a  Form.  All  phenomena  of  Life  are  
rooted in causal Ideas and patterned on Noetic Forms. There are billions 
of  Archetypal  Forms  reflected  in  the  Worlds  of  Existence.  Each  form  
possesses a unique Circle of Possibility which demarcates its expression. 
Under the auspices of the Holy Spirit, the Archangels work through the 
Forms to create and sustain the multiform phenomena of Life.
GROSS MATERIAL WORLD, GROSS MATERIAL BODY 
The  lowest  vibration  of  Mind.  Mind  made  solid,  composing  the  three-
dimensional world and all gross material bodies.
GUARDIAN ARCHANGEL, THE METATHRONIOS - THE ARCHANGEL 
AFTER THE THRONE
At the point of our original incarnation, having passed through the Idea of 
Heavenly Man, each of us is accompanied and protected by our Guardian 
Archangel.  Throughout  our  sojourn  into  the  Worlds  of  Separateness,  

399
GLOSSARY OF BASIC TERMS
our  Archangel  guards,  protects,  advises  and  accompanies  our  present-
day  personality  self.  Additionally,  He  helps  our  Permanent  Personality  
plan each incarnation - without ever interfering with our Free Will. This 
Archangel, with whom we are ‘Egofied,’ is of the Order of the Thrones.
HEAVENLY MAN, THE IDEA OF MAN
Heavenly Man is one of the Ideas of Absolute BE-ingness, always being 
an  indispensable  part  of  our  Nature  as  Spirit-Self.  A  Holy  Monadic  
emanation of our Spirit-Self passes through the Idea of Man on its way 
to  incarnate.  Archangelic  Man  is  also  an  archetype  belonging  to  the  
Archangelic  Orders.  For  this  reason,  Human  Beings  and  Archangels  are  
Brothers. The Causal Law of the Human Form in Heavenly Man manifests 
our Seven Bodies or Vehicles, yet One.
HOLY MONAD, HOLY-MONADIC SELF
Our real identity as Spirit-Ego BE-ings. A Holy Monad might be thought 
of as one of countless myriads of ‘cells’ within the Multiplicity, Oneness 
and Self-sufficiency of the Absolute BE-ingness.
HOLY SPIRIT, SHEKHINAH (in Aramaic)
The  dynamic  aspect  of  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  as  Total  Wisdom  and  
Almightiness. The Holy Spirit is impersonal Absolute Super-consciousness 
that expresses the Omnipotence of the Absolute BE-ingness. It allows for 
the creation and preservation of the Universes. We experience the Holy 
Spirit as Pan-universal Wisdom, Power and Force.
HYPOSTASIS, HYPOSTATIC NATURE
Hypostasis denotes ‘being’, expressing existence or ‘substantive reality’.  
Regarding Man, Hypostatic Nature is our Natural ability to express our 
Innermost Self in Creation.
INNER SELF
A  term  indicating  the  Soul  Self-aware  Self  in  Its  projection  as  the  
Permanent Personality.
INTROSPECTION
An inner exploration to trace the sources of our behaviour with the resolve 
to  self-consciously  structure  our  personality  and  its  subconscious.  The  
aim  of  Introspection  is  to  free  the  self  of  the  limitations  of  egoism,  by  
releasing the burden of consciousness, ‘Purge your conscience from dead 
works to serve the living God’ (Hebrews 9:14). Daily Introspection, also 
termed ‘looking within’, is the process of self-examination, of ‘knowing 
thyself ’. This is the core practice of every Researcher after the Truth and 
all those interested in Self-Realisation.

LOGOS, CHRIST LOGOS, JESUS CHRIST, JOSHUA IMMANUEL THE CHRIST, 
THE GODMAN, THE MOST BELOVED ONE, SHADDAI EL (in Aramaic)
The  Logos,  the  Divine  Common  Selfhood,  is  the  Absolute  BE-ingness  
manifested   as   Absolute   Super   Self-consciousness.   Logos-Λόγος   in   
Greek has been translated into English to mean ‘Word’. ‘In the beginning 
[authority]  was  the  Word,  and  the  Word  was  with  God,  and  the  Word  
was God’ (John 1:1). The Logos is ‘The real light which enlightens every 
man  coming  into  the  world’  (John  1:9).  Joshua  Immanuel  speaks  as  the  
Christ  Logos  when  He  says,  ‘I  am  the  Son  of  God’  (Matthew  27:43),  
and  as  a  Human  Being  when  He  speaks  as  the  ‘For  the  Son  of  Man  is  
come  to  save  that  which  was  lost’  (Matthew  18:11).  Joshua  Immanuel  
the Godman is a direct and pure Ray of the Pan-Universal Christ Logos, 
incarnated  by  immaculate  conception  through  the  Virgin  Mary,  twenty  
centuries  ago,  in  Palestine.  His  Divine  Teachings,  as  preserved  in  the  
New  Testament,  are  cherished  in  our  work  as  universal  and  timeless,  
offering indispensable guidance in the exaltation of consciousness.
MEDITATION
The inner reaches of introspection become the outer reaches of meditation, 
as the exploration moves beyond the subjective experience of the present-
day personality, into the boundless ocean of Mind, towards the universal 
and the eternal.
MERCY AND GRACE, DIVINE
The  most  compassionate,  mysterious  and  little  understood  forces  in  
Creation. Divine Mercy and Grace permit the miraculous to occur - the 
seeming exceptions to the Law of Cause and Effect. It is by the Grace of God 
that we are embodied, entrusted with the gift of Free Will. And it is the 
Mercy of God that ‘Maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and 
sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust’ (Matthew 5:45). For as St. James 
wrote in his Epistle, ‘And mercy rejoiceth against judgment’ (James 2:13).
MIND, MIND-LIGHT
The bearer of the Will-pleasure of Absolute BE-ingness as LIFE-LIGHT. 
Everything  that  exists  is  made  of  Mind-Light  at  varying  frequencies  
from  Super-substance,  substance,  super-matter,  etheric  matter  to  solid  
matter. Mind is not God, the Logos or the Holy Spirit, but an emanation 
of the Absolute BE-ingness imbued with Total Wisdom, Total Love, Total 
Power. It is the means by which the Universes are created. Mind is Divine 
at its source and Holy in its expression. When the word ‘mind’ is used to 
express its everyday meanings, it appears in lower casing.
MOTION-MOVEMENT-KINESIS
Motion  (with  capital  M)  denotes  the  Law  or  Principle,  whereas  motion  

401
GLOSSARY OF BASIC TERMS
(m in lower casing) is the act or process of moving. On the other hand, 
Movement is the act or process of changing location or position. Kinesis 
is  a  type  of  movement  that  lacks  directional  orientation  and  depends  
upon the intensity of stimulation.
MULTIPLICITY, PLURALITY, DIVINE
The   Oneness   of   the   Absolute   BE-ingness   in   Its   manifold   Nature   
manifests  within  Itself  Spirits  beyond  number,  as  gods  within  the  One  
God-Spirit.  The  entire  diversity  of  Life  resides  within  God,  in  ‘The 
fulness of him that filleth all in all’ (Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians 
1:23).  Each  Archangel  or  Man  is  a  droplet  of  Spirit  from  the  vast  body  
of  the  Ocean  of  the  One  Spirit  –  the  Absolute  BE-ness.  Our  essential  
Spiritual Nature is the same.
NOETIC STATE
A  state  linking  the  Worlds  of  Separateness  to  the  Causal  States,  where  
Forms  are  unexpressed  in  the  Eternal  Now.  From  the  Noetic  State,  the  
Archangels derive the Forms to create and sustain the phenomena of Life. 
This state is where we come to rest in between incarnations.
NOETICAL WORLD, NOETICAL BODY
The  five-dimensional  world,  and  the  most  rarefied  of  the  three  Worlds  
of  Separateness.  The  Noetical  World  is  the  realm  of  thought-form  and  
the  home  of  our  noetical  body.  Here  the  Total  Wisdom  of  the  Absolute  
BE-ingness  finds  expression  in  the  Worlds  of  Duality  as  manifested  
forms, ranging from galaxies to unicellular organisms, all constructed of 
Mind Super-substance. This is a World of seven planes, each with seven 
sub-planes.
OBSERVATION
Observation is an attribute of our Divine Nature and is attention without 
tension.  Perfect  concentration.  The  ability  to  observe  in  detail  and  to  
recall what we have observed, is vital to our comprehension of Life.
PASSING-OVER, DEATH
A  euphemism  for  what  is  commonly  termed  ‘dying’.  Passing-over  is  
properly understood as an episode within a Circle of Possibility where a 
personality concludes its existence in one dimension only to continue in 
other worlds. Death is not an end, but a beginning, a birth into another 
dimension.
PERMANENT ATOM
The core of the Permanent Personality which records the experiences and 
lessons it has received in time and space-place. The Permanent Atom is 
situated in each body simultaneously, and not only is the blueprint upon 

YOUR WINGS TO FLY
402
which the Archangels of the Elements will create our bodies, but it also 
registers  emotions,  thoughts,  reactions,  and  experiences  as  they  occur  
in the Worlds of Existence. Thus, it can be discerned as the Permanent 
Noetical Atom, the Permanent Psychical Atom and the Permanent Gross 
Material Atom, Three yet One.
PERMANENT PERSONALITY
The  active  aspect  of  the  Self-aware  Soul,  both  within  and  beyond  the  
Worlds of Separateness. The Permanent Personality filters knowledge to 
the  present-day  personality  and  instills  wisdom,  remaining  untouched  
by the mundane.
PRESENT-DAY PERSONALITY
A  personality  developed  during  each  incarnation,  which  we  may  call  
‘George’  or  ‘Mary’.  The  present-day  personality  is  a  projection  of  the  
Permanent Personality into the Worlds of Separateness. This petty self, 
infatuated with knowledge resulting from the five senses, is the sum-total 
of its elementals. The work of the present-day personality self-aware Self 
is  by  cultivating  a  humble,  moral  and  loving  character  to  become  the  
master of its bodies, the master of desire and thought.
PRINCIPLES AND LAWS, DIVINE
Divine Principles and Laws govern all expressions in time and space-place. 
Being the Nature of Absolute BE-ingness, they comprise the fundamental 
structure of the Divine Plan, keeping all Worlds and Universes in balance 
and order. Epitomizing Reason and Love manifested, it is our recognition 
of, and alignment with these Laws and Principles (e.g. of Cause and Effect, 
Harmony, Order, Growth, Love, as well as the Circles of Possibilities and 
Probabilities),  which  lead  us  to  attunement  and  at-one-ment  with  God.  
Also see CAUSES AND IDEAS.
PSYCHICAL WORLD, PSYCHICAL BODY
The  four-dimensional  world,  also  known  as  the  ‘world  of  emotions’.  
Our  psychical  body  is  composed  of  a  mixture  of  our  conscious  and  
subconscious  emotions  and  desires,  some  helpful,  others  harmful.  The  
super-sensuous Psychical World, home of our psychical body, is divided 
into  seven  planes,  and  each  in  seven  sub-planes.  It  is  to  the  Psychical  
Worlds that we travel in first exosomatosis, with our psychical body, and 
to which, on passing-over, we first go.
PSYCHO-NOETICAL
The relationship between the Psychical World of emotions and the Noetical 
World  of  thoughts  is  so  interwoven  that  we  have  to  consider  them  as  
semi-unified.  Since  Thought  and  Emotion  have  opposite  polarities  (the  
first one being electric and the second magnetic in nature), they tend to 

403
GLOSSARY OF BASIC TERMS
adhere to each other. There is scarcely a thought without some emotion, 
and in every emotion there is a measure of thought.
PSYCHO-NOETICAL IMAGES
Multi-dimensional images of psycho-noetical substance, formed through 
visualisation  by  means  of  Noetic  Light.  Once  formed,  these  elementals  
are everlasting, as are all elementals.
PSYCHOTHERAPY
Esoteric  Christian  psychotherapy  encompasses  a  complete  range  of  
healing. Not limited to treating problems within the personality, a true 
psychotherapist is concerned with noetical, psychical and physical health. 
An  aspiring  psychotherapist  must  train  himself  in  many  respects:  the  
conscious use of Etheric Vitality (in the Four states of Ether), visualisation, 
the comprehensive knowledge of human anatomy (including the etheric 
doubles),  the  understanding  of  the  subconsciousness,  and  awareness  of  
Divine  Laws.  A  Psychotherapist’s  effectiveness  in  healing  depends  on  
the purity of his heart and consciousness. He must not consider himself 
a  ‘healer’,  but  rather  a  worthy  conduit  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  Compassion,  
concern, understanding and above all, love are his values. He considers 
his patients as Spirit-Soul-Egos in the Common Selfhood, with time and 
space-place difficulties.
SELF-AWARENESS, SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS
A  state  of  conscious  awareness  of  the  Self  within  the  Divine  Plan.  
Through work and will-power, we awake from the slumber of everyday 
consciousness  into  a  state  of  expanded  Self-awareness.  We  become  
conscious of ourself as an Individuated BE-ing and Existence, in varying 
degrees.
SELFHOOD, I-NESS
Individuated Selfhood encompasses all the expressions of the Self from 
its  source  as  a  Holy  Monad,  filtered  down  to  the  petty  present-day  
personality.  Within  the  Selfhood,  not  a  single  expression  is  devalued;  
each is cherished in its own right. Our Spirit-Ego BE-ing partakes in the 
Will-pleasure of the Absolute BE-ingness (to express Itself in Itself ) by 
expressing Itself within Its own Selfhood.
SELF-REALISATION
The  culmination  of  the  gathering  of  experience  in  the  Worlds  of  
Separateness, leading to full awareness of who and what we really are as 
Individuated BE-ingness. Self-Realisation is attained when the present-
day personality is transmuted into the Permanent Personality, and unified 
with  the  Self-aware  Soul;  the  preparatory  stage  to  assimilate  with  the  
Spirit-Ego Self in Theosis.

SELF-SUFFICIENCY, DIVINE
A   characteristic   of   the   Absolute   BE-ingness:   complete   Abundance,   
Blessedness, and Independence of all needs.
SELF SUPER-CONSCIOUSNESS
Through faithful introspection we become first Self-conscious, and later 
Self Super-conscious. Then, we are simultaneously totally aware of our 
BE-ingness  and  Existence,  and  we  are  therefore  free  to  express  our  real  
Self  beyond  the  limitations  of  time  and  space-place.  This  is  very  well  
described by the Godman, ‘The wind [Spirit] bloweth where it listeth, and 
thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and 
whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit’ (John 3:8).
SOUL, SELF-AWARE
A ray of a Holy Monad that passed through the Idea of Heavenly Man. 
The Soul is not created; It is the ‘Precious Pearl’ of the Spirit, according to 
the parable (Matthew 13:46). The incorruptible Soul is in a formless state 
of Spirit, containing and expressing the Idea of Man. When returning to 
the Godhead, the Soul marries the Spirit-Ego BE-ing in a State of Super 
Self-consciousness. It has become ‘fuller,’since It has achieved Its Devine 
Purpose of becoming the Vehicle for the Individuation of our Spirit.
SPIRIT-EGO BE-ING
Our  Self  as  a  Divine  BE-ing:  boundless,  eternal,  and  immovable.  Our  
Spirit-Ego  BE-ing  is  the  Self  as  Holy  Monad,  Super  Self-conscious,  in  
at-one-ment  with  the  Almighty.  The  Will  of  our  Spirit-Ego  BE-ing  to  
express Itself in Its own Selfhood derives from the Will-pleasure of the 
Absolute BE-ingness to express Itself within Itself.
SUBCONSCIOUS, SUBCONSCIOUSNESS
Subconscious is used to denote the condition we harbour in our present-
day personality that we are not aware of and which is not immediately 
available  to  consciousness.  On  the  other  hand,  Subconsciousness  is  the  
subconscious  state  of  the  Mind  Super-substance.  Researchers  after  the  
Truth understand the triadic nature of the sub-conscious. One chamber, 
so to speak, of the subconscious contains all the elementals composing 
our personality. Another chamber serves as the store-house of Life-giving 
Etheric Vitality. The most valuable chamber is that of the Logos and the 
Holy Spirit – the Kingdom of the Heavens within us.
SUPER-CONSCIOUSNESS
Super-consciousness is total awareness in BE-ingness. A state of expanded 
consciousness beyond the boundaries of time and space-place.

405
GLOSSARY OF BASIC TERMS
SYSTEM FOR THE RESEARCH AFTER THE TRUTH
Our System of Esoteric Christianity recognises the Eternal Truths known 
to all great religious traditions, while firmly based in the teachings of the 
Godman Joshua Immanuel the Christ, and the New Testament. Through 
directed study, exercises and meditations, we seek the balanced evolution 
and  integration  of  our  entire  being,  as  we  cultivate  our  moral,  ethical,  
spiritual,  and  mystical  aspects.  Our  approach  is  methodical,  safe,  and  
self-evident and is based on Seven Promises towards ourselves.
THEOSIS
At-one-ment  with  the  One  God,  the  Absolute  BE-ingness.  The  moment  
when the Prodigal Son, now Self Super-conscious, returns ‘Home’ to his 
most loving Father.
TOTAL LOVE, TOTAL WISDOM AND TOTAL POWER
Primary attributes of the Nature of Absolute BE-ingness and all BE-ings. 
They constitute a sacred triangle, each aspect complementing the other.
VISUALISATION
Visualisation  is  a  language  of  the  Divine,  the  ‘Key’  (Revelation  3:7)  to  
the  kingdoms  of  Life.  After  learning  to  carefully  observe  and  to  fully  
concentrate, we gain the ability to visualise consciously. We use Etheric 
Vitality  to  create  elementals,  from  psycho-noetical  images  to  entire  
scenes.  Through  visualisation,  in  healing  work,  we  learn  to  materialise  
and dematerialise. Visualisation is the process of harnessing thought in 
a constructive manner.
WILL-PLEASURE
God’s Pleasure in Creativeness. The Absolute BE-ingness expressing Itself 
in Itself as Creation.
WORLDS OF SEPARATENESS, WORLDS OF DUALITY, THE MUNDANE
The  three  Worlds  of  Existence  (Material,  Psychical  and  Noetical)  in  
which  the  present-day  personality  resides  in  apparent  separation  from  
the Spiritual States of At-one-ment and BE-ingness. These are the Worlds 
of  Duality,  of  time  and  space-place,  which  we  experience  during  each  
incarnation  as  the  influence  of  the  multitude  pairs  of  opposites  (e.g.  
good-bad, much-less, positive-negative).
