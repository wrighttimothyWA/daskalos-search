GATES TO THE LIGHT 
Exercises and Meditations 

This book follows a  more 
general introduction to exercise 
and meditation entitled The 
Esoteric Practice (1994) by 
Dr. Stylianos Atteshlis, 
Panayiota's father and teacher. 
The Esoteric Practice helps 
students awake and refine their 
ability to visualise. Among other 
titles by Dr. Atteshlis is The 
Esoteric Teachings (1992) which 
details the more theoretical 
aspects of the Christian Esoteric 
approach to Truth. 
For the sake of simplicity the 
male pronoun is employed 
throughout this book.

I dedicate this book to  my grandchildren, Christina, 
Andreas and Stylianos III, and to  children all  over the 
world. I especially remember the  children of  Brazil, the 
love and warmth !felt while I was there. 
I pray that the Christ-light will guide and illumine all 
children to use  the  gifts of  our Father in  love, innocence 
and purity, by  right-thinking, right-feeling and right­
action. May they lead our world into a better future. For in 
them is  "the true light, which lighteth every man that 
cometh into the world" (fohn 1:9). 

Credo 
I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven 
and earth and of all things visible and invisible. 
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of 
God, begotten of his Father before all worlds, God of  God, 
Light of  Light, very God of  very God, begotten not  made, 
being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things 
were made; who for  us  men and  for  our  salvation came 
down from heaven and was incarnate by  the Holy Spirit of 
the virgin Mary and was made man; and was crucified also 
for us under Pontius Pilate. He suffered and was buried. 
And the  third day he  rose again according to  the 
Scriptures and  ascended into heaven and  sits  at  the  right 
hand of  the  Father.  And he will come again with glory to 
judge both the  living and  the  dead, whose kingdom  will 
have no end. 
And I believe in  the  Holy Spirit, the  Lord and Giver of 
life, who procedes from the Father and the  Son, who with 
the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified, 
who spoke by  the prophets. 
And I believe in  one holy Christian and Apostolic 
Church, I aknowledge one Baptism for  the  remission of 
sins, and I look for the resurrection of the dead and the life 
of the world to come. Amen

Understanding the Gates 
to the Light 
We are not our emotions, our desires, nor our thoughts. We 
are not our three bodies, but something Jar greater: "I have 
said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most 
High" (Psalm 82:6). 

Gates to the Light

When I was a little girl we lived at the foot of a small hill. 
After my father returned home from work he often picked 
me  up  and, putting me  on  his  shoulders, we  walked 
among the flowers of the hill. He would set me down beside 
him,  take my tiny hand in his big palm, and say,  "Yiota, 
look around. What can you see? What do you feel? What, " 
he added softly, "do you smell?" Together we would explore 
the  beauty and  complexity of  a  small flower, study the 
flight of a bumblebee, and try to understand the singing of 
the crickets. 
My  father was  constantly teaching me  to  see,  to 
observe, and to be aware. As many of you know, waking 
people out  of  their  slumber was  a  great passion of  my 
father. By asking me to sit quietly and showing me how to 
look deep into the centre of a wild flower, I know now that 
my father was trying to connect me with "the pulse of life", 
the manifold work of the Holy Archangels. 
As  I  grew into  adolescence my  father continued to 
guide me. Then I married and, of course, became involved 
with  the  necessities of  the  material world. But I  always 
longed for those times in my childhood and hoped that, 
some day, I could once again find more time to experience 
the spiritual dimensions of life. 
In the meantime, the hill had been divided by a street 
with houses lining both sides. My father's message began to 
reach many people. He  was  instructing hundreds each 
month in the "Stoa" near our house. 
Eventually I was able to set other things aside in my life 
and help my father in his work. He soon asked me to guide 
meditations and in this way balance his teachings with 
experience. For years we have gathered in the peace of the 
Stoa and meditated on various themes. 
In  response to  many requests, I  have collected an 
assortment of those exercises and meditations under this 
cover. I hope you will find them helpful in guiding you into 
the glory, peace, and beauty of Divine Life. 
I  would like  to  express my  gratitude to  the  many 
friends that  assisted in  the  preparation of  this  work. 
Special appreciation goes  to Rudolf and Eliane Stauch, 
and  Paul Skorpen for  their  invaluable help  and  con­
tributions. I also extend my heartfelt thanks to Dominik 
Stauch for his inspired illustrations. 

Understanding the Gates to the Light 
Understanding the Gates to the Light 
Introduction 
Striving for  freedom, Man tends to  create more ties  that 
bind. Searching for  companionship, he may find himself 
alone. Struggling for peace, he sets off the sparks of war. 
There is a constant battle between positive and negative 
forces. 
Man sees himself as an individual standing apart from 
the whole, solely concerned with his own welfare, and at 
best, with the  well-being of  his  own family, community 
and  nation.  This attitude leads to  the  destruction of  the 
planet. When will Man realise that the whole planet is his 
home and  all  people are  family? Eventually Man must 
awaken. He will  stop  living in  illusion and  see reality:  a 
reality only visible to the eyes of the soul. 
Each man is responsible for his joys and sorrows; the 
paradise or  hell  he  lives in.  No  one  can  escape the 
consequences of  his  behaviour, good or  bad. The  time 
will  come for everyone to  face  the  results of  his  actions 
toward others and  toward life  itself. Man judges and 
punishes himself. Joshua Emmanuel said, "Thou shalt love 
the Lord thy  God with all thy heart,  and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy  mind" (Matt. 22:37). In  loving God, we 
love all. As God is in everyone and everything we cannot 
hurt  any  other being, or anything, without harming our­
selves. 
It  is  only through sincere introspection that an 
individual arrives at  real  self-knowledge and  is  able to 
acknowledge the  value of  life's experiences. When  the 
present-day personality is  purified, true self-respect is 
gained. As a man's personality becomes aligned with his 
inner nature, he realises the great powers entrusted to him 
by  God the  Father. He  can  then use  these  gifts self­
consciously in the service of life and humanity. 
God places within us a key.  This key is in our heart, 
and our heart is the centre of love. With this key we can 
open the doors to the heavenly mysteries and to the glory 
of life.  If we wish to see the worlds beyond, we must do 
it in Spirit. Our material body cannot stand the vibrations 
Each of the four arms of the 
cross - a universal symbol -can 
be seen as one of the four 
elements (fire, air, water and 
earth). The elongated arm 
extending downward, earth, 
symbolises life on the material 
plane.

of infinite Love. In the worlds of Spirit everything is under 
the  divine Law of  Love.  Man must identify with his 
nucleus - the Archetype of the Heavenly Man - in order 
to achieve universal harmony. He  will  unite consciously 
with the  eternal frequencies of  the  Archangels, Virgin 
Mary and Christ Logos. 
As the power of the Spirit-Soul-Self shines through the 
present-day personality, he  will know the  truth and  be 
free. When man is able to reach the  centre of his being, 
the heart of  life  and creation, he  knows the  true  way to 
act,  which is  to  love.  The revealed truth has  to  be 
translated into the terms of daily life. 
On Meditation and Exercise 
Everyday I  hear from people of  their fears,  doubts and 
worries of what to  do  and  where to  go.  As  present-day 
personalities, we all have some fears and doubts. Yet if we 
connect with our  Real Self, the  God within, we  can 
observe our  present-day personality and  change things. 
We  can  learn to meditate and attune ourselves to  Christ. 
Christ is  always in  us,  and  we  in  Him, but  we  need to 
increase our awareness of Him. 
In human life there is confusion and chaos. We  have 
to move beyond the worries and struggles of the present­
day  self and act in  harmony and  love. Life  on  Earth will 
then be easier and joyful. 
Sincere meditation is a way to God, to find His glory 
within ourselves and in the life that surrounds us.  Growth 
and development come slowly as we increase conscious­
ness, until we  attain full  God-consciousness. Books and 
teachers cannot take us  there. They can  only point the 
way.  We  have to make this journey ourselves, in order to 
experience the  highest states of  consciousness, and  the 
beautiful, true Reality. 
We  are  not alone in this  search. We  are  guided. Our 
Guardian Archangel and also many previously incarnated 
spirit guides help us on this painful but beautiful journey. 
They feel  our  pain, and  as  we  learn from our  mistakes, 
they rejoice in our growth. Although they stand by us with 
love, they cannot remove the bitter cup. 
Many people feel  disappointed when they begin to 
meditate.  They see  nothing, hear nothing, and  feel  as  if 
they are  sitting in  darkness.  We  have to  work and  train 
ourselves. First we feel, then we see and hear. With effort, 
in the course of time, all will feel,  see and hear. 

Understanding the Gates to the Light 
When I have fears or doubts, I close my eyes and say: 
"The Lord is  my sheph  erd. I sh all not want. He  maketh me 
to lie down in green pastures ... "CPs. 23:1,  2).  I  then feel 
light expanding within. It has  always been there. I  have 
opened my  present-day personality to  this  light.  When  I 
have problems, I  find  new  strength to  make corrections. 
By  cooperating with the  Archangels, Virgin Mary and 
Christ, everything becomes calm, and my bodies are once 
again balanced. Christ shows me the Way. I always try to 
attune my  present-day personality to  my  Permanent 
Personality and to Him. 
Through observation, concentration and  meditation, 
we  learn to see the seven heavens in  us.  When material 
life  grows heavy, instead of  looking outward to  solve 
problems, we  should turn inward to  find peace and 
happiness. We have to   work patiently, always 
remembering that spiritual truth and awareness are two of 
the greatest gifts of our Father. 
We must realise that we have been placed in a certain 
position in  life,  with karmic responsibilities and  oppor­
tunities. To grow spiritually we must honour both our gifts 
as well as our debts. If we are not conscious in this world, 
it  is  as  if  we  were not  really living. And, if  we  are  not 
conscious of  God within us,  we  cannot expand and 
become aware of the Eternal Now. We should turn our life 
into a meditation. 
As   personalities, we should learn from the 
consequences of  our  actions, thoughts, emotions and 
deeds of  what we have done, and  are  constantly doing. 
Unfortunately, we are often blind to our faults.  When we 
become ill,  have psychological or material problems, we 
wonder why God "sent" them to  us.  God never sends 
anything negative to  us. "For  God is  not the  author of 
confusion, but 
ofpeace"(l Cor.  14:33). 
As   personalities, we have to   pay for our 
transgressions. We must apply what we have learned, pay 
as  gracefully as  possible, and thus avoid greater 
difficulties in the future. 
We have to learn to control our personalities.  We  can 
control our thoughts, maybe even our material body, but 
it is not easy to control our emotions! Whenever you feel 
you  cannot control your emotions, turn  to  the  heavens 
within where you will find peace and rest. 
Have faith in our Father. He knows our every need. In 
every bitter experience, there is an invaluable lesson that 
leaves us  stronger and  more resolved. "It  is good fo r me 
that I have been afflicted;  that I might learn thy statutes" 
(Ps.  11
9
:71).

Allow the  Christ-light to  shine through your mind, 
cleaning your thoughts, and through your heart, cleaning 
your emotions.  With a clean mind and heart all problems 
can  be  overcome.  The  strength that  comes from a  pure 
heart, placed in Christ's hands, changes all that is negative 
into positive, darkness gives way to  light. Attuned to  the 
Christ-light we are free from disease and discomfort.  It is 
most important to  learn the  lessons of  self-control and 
self-discipline if we wish to  enjoy perfect health and the 
rich beauty of life. 
Being and Existing 
In  the  Absolute  Divine  Authority is  the  Logos and  the 
Logos is in  God  and  the  Logos is  God.  God is  Light. All 
things are  formed of and through Mind-light. If on  earth 
there was only darkness, with no sunlight, there would be 
no life. As the sun's rays give light and life to the earth, the 
Spiritual Sun gives Light and Life to Man. 
Absolute Beingness was, is,  and always will be,  mea­
sureless without beginning or  end.  It  is  the  Law  ruling 
everything.  God is Life.  We  are living in Him, in His Self­
hood. We are and we exist. "For in him we live, and move, 
and have our being"(Acts 17:28). 
As Holy Monadic Beings, we are always in  Absolute 
Beingness, eternal and unchanging.  As human beings we 
move in Him as phenomena of life.  Absolute Beingness is 
infinity and we exist in time and place.  God is the ocean 
and  we  are  a  drop of  the  ocean. In  quality we  are  the 
same, but in quantity we differ. 
In  Absolute Beingness there are  billions and billions 
of  Holy Monads. Each Monad is  composed of  millions 
upon millions of  Spirit Beings. Only a  small ray  of each 
Spirit Being projects itself into  Creation.  This ray dresses 
itself with Mind. 
All the worlds of existence, and everything they con­
tain, are  constructed of  Mind. Beyond the  worlds of 
separation in the Noetic and Causal universes, Mind in its 
highest frequencies is formed into Archetypes, Ideas, and 
Principles. Each world obeys set  laws. We  can  see  and 
understand each plane as we become more conscious of 
our corresponding body. 
Our  bodies  follow the  same  laws as  all  expressed 
forms in  Creation.  Our noetical body - the  body of 
thought - with its etheric double lives in the five-dimen­
sional world and  is  constructed of  Mind as  super-sub-

Understanding the Gates to the Light 
stance. Our psychical body-the body of emotion-with 
its etheric double lives within the four-dimensional world, 
built of Mind as substance. The physical body, so familiar 
to  us,  is  composed of  Mind as  solid matter and  moves 
within the  three-dimensional plane. It  is  linked to  the 
other bodies by its etheric double, which consist of Mind 
substance. Our three bodies, and the three worlds of sep­
aration, express themselves in different ways, and yet they 
are one. 
When  the  time arises these three bodies dissolve; 
however, the Spirit Light remains. It is the Spirit-Soul that 
will again dress itself with matter to  reincarnate. 
Reincarnation serves the evolution of the personality until 
it  is  assimilated into  the  Spirit-Soul-Self.  The  purpose of 
man's life on Earth is the gradual  attunement to the voice 
of his Spirit within himself. 
Once we know through our own experience who and 
what we  are,  we  no  longer fear  the  phenomenon of 
death. I am and I am living - even after my bodies "die". 
I know and see with the wisdom of Christ Logos and the 
Holy Spirit, and understand that I am an eternal Self in the 
plurality of God. I AM I , and forever, I AM. 
Archangels 
The  Archangelic Orders are  Intelligences found within 
the  universal  expression of  God.  They build and  main­
tain  life  in  all  of  God's kingdoms and  encourage the 
development of  human consciousness. They identify 
directly with the  Holy Spirit, under whose care they 
work. Since they are  not  individualised, nor  separated 
from the  oneness of  God, they do  not  evolve as  we 
human beings do.  Instead they form classes of  expres­
sion of life. Purely and simply they express divine Power, 
Wisdom and Goodness. 
There are  twelve Archangelic Orders, of  which we 
only know the  names of  seven: Thrones, Authorities, 
Dominions, Principalities, Overlords, Seraphim and 
Cherubim.  Our own Guardian Archangel is of the  Order 
of the Thrones. He is egofied with us during our journey 
into the worlds of separation, watching over our present­
day personality with much love and care. 
We  must learn to  work self-consciously with the 
Archangels, especially with the  Archangels of  the  Ele­
ments, who build and  maintain our  physical, psychical 
and  noetical bodies and  their etheric  doubles. Within

every form, from the human body to the universe, work a 
Gabriel, a Michael, a Raphael and a Oriel. 
Archangel Gabriel is  the  soul  of  the  Earth.  He  rules 
over the element of water - which covers 75% of the sur­
face of our planet - and the liquids in our material body. 
Gabriel also helps bring peace and harmony to our psy­
chical body. His colour is sky-blue. 
Archangel Michael vibrates light, fire, and  all  the 
shades of the colour red.  As water is the primary element 
of Gabriel, fire is Michael's element.  Fire is the heat of the 
sun and the heart of the planet. In our body Michael pro­
vides warm red blood. 
Archangel Raphael is  the  result of  the  cooperation 
between Gabriel and Michael.  His  colour is violet which 
symbolises etheric vitality and  its  electro-magnetic force. 
Energy is Raphael's element.  He supplies our bodies with 
power and strength. 
Archangel Oriel coordinates the  work of  all  the 
Archangels of  the  Elements.  He  vibrates silvery-white 
light.  Oriel keeps order and harmony within each of  our 
bodies and  between them. Macrocosmically and  micro­
cosmically he is the Great Balancer. 
As  there are thousands of  cells composing our  body 
and thousands of solar systems within a galaxy, there are 
innumerable Gabriels within one  expression of  Gabriel 
and countless Michaels, Raphaels, and Oriels in  one 
expression of an Order. The universal Michael, the galac­
tic Michael, the solar Michael, the Earth Michael, and the 
Michael in our bodies are the same in essence.  In expres­
sion their difference is only quantitative. And this is so for 
all  the  Archangelic Orders. They are  in  the  super-con­
scious Plurality of God, working together in His univers­
es.  Nothing is out of place in God's Plan. 
Our  "workshop", in which many of the exercises are 
experienced, is a pyramid. Within the pyramid, which we 
construct with psycho-noetical light, we  come into inti­
mate contact with divine Beings. When standing upright 
within the  pyramid Archangel Michael appears on  our 
right side, while on  the  left  side  Raphael manifests, and 
behind us Gabriel comes forth. Oriel, who remains form­
less, is  experienced from the  base of  the  pyramid.  The 
triangle facing you  is  the  space for  Absolute Beingness, 
Christ Logos, and Virgin Mary. 
The  exercises and  meditations in  this book help us 
develop awareness of  the  Archangelic Orders and  our 
ability to cooperate with them. 

Understanding the Gates to the Light 
Life Energy, Etheric Doubles,  Energy 
Centres,  and the Ethers 
Our  Spirit-Souls are  pure, perfect light, seeds from God. 
Coming into the worlds of separation we are clothed with 
Mind-light.  Mind becomes matter, shaped by  vibration, 
motion, rhythm, and sound. The Archangels construct the 
human body atom by  atom through the  mould of  the 
etheric double of each body - first the noetical, then the 
psychical, and finally the  material. The three bodies 
remain linked to one  another through their etheric dou­
bles. Etheric doubles contain light-energy and  etheric 
vitality.  Without their etheric doubles our  bodies would 
be empty shells. 
The  material body is  an  exact replica of  its  etheric 
double. As our body has limbs, so does the etheric dou­
ble, and every time we move our material body, the ether­
ic double moves in unison. It is possible to train ourselves 
to use our etheric limbs self-consciously.  An etheric limb 
has few  of the  limitations of  the  heavy material body. It 
may, for  example, be  lifted out  of  the  material form, 
extended and used to penetrate gross matter. In our exer­
cises we often work with our etheric hands. We visualise 
psycho-noetical light pouring from our  fingers to  create 
images and  forms. We  can  also learn to  see  with our 
etheric eyes and hear with our etheric ears. 
As  we  advance in  our  self-conscious awareness we 
will  find  that  we  can  train ourselves to  use  the  etheric 
doubles of  our  psychical and  noetical bodies for  much 
greater work. 
The exercises will have us work with centres of ener­
gy  in our etheric doubles. In the East they are known as 
"chakras".  These centres are  positioned throughout the 
etheric doubles, varying in size and function.  Every pore 
on the skin has a centre.  Every gland has a centre. Every 
fingertip has a centre. What is the nature of these centres? 
If you  study a bathtub while it drains you will see water 
funnel down. This forms a whirlpool typical of  the  basic 
shape and motion of our etheric centres. 
Each of our three bodies, displays its own energy cen­
tres  on  its  etheric double. On  the  etheric double of  the 
material body we refer to the energy centres as  "church­
es" (cf.  Rev.  1:20). On the etheric double of the psychical 
body they are  termed "lamps" (cf.  Rev. 4:5). And  on  the 
etheric double of the noetical body we behold "stars" (cf. 
Rev.  1:16-20).  Careful observation reveals that the centres, 
on  the  etheric double of  the  material body, appear as 
A symbol for the "divine man". 
The upward pointing triangle 
represents our divinity, while the 
downward pointed triangle 
stands for our descent into 
matter.

discs, while on the psycho-noetical levels we see them as 
spheres. 
These centres serve several functions. They control 
the  flow and  quality of  etheric vitality necessary for  the 
health and well-being of our bodies. They also act as links 
between the  material, psychical, and  noetical bodies, 
channelling thoughts and  emotions. And it  is  through 
these gates that elementals are emitted and received into 
the  personality.  They are  stored within the  centres and 
they affect the character for better or worse. 
As many of these centres play a vital role in our phys­
ical  and  psychological health we  must approach them 
with care and respect. The Holy Archangels are working 
without pause in  these centres and  are  most pleased to 
teach us more about them when we reach a certain level 
of  awareness.  We  must, however, first  become master of 
the elementals that we are creating and revitalising. 
Within  the  etheric doubles, life-energy exists in  four 
states: imprint ether, sensate ether, kinetic ether, and cre­
ative ether. 
Imprint ether is used to shape etheric vitality into psy­
cho-noetical images, vital to  our  work in  visualisation. 
Sensate ether is the "feeling giving" ether. By merit of sen­
sate ether, we  experience the sensations of pleasure and 
pain. Kinetic ether allows motion and  movement both 
within the  material and psycho-noetical bodies.  Creative 
ether, the prime ether, is in the care of the Holy Spirit and 
the Holy Archangels.  It is through creative ether that our 
bodies, indeed all bodies, are constructed and sustained. 
In the past we have misused creative ether and are now 
allowed only limited use of the life-forming ether. In time, 
in  accordance with our  spiritual development, we  will 
again be entrusted with all our Father's gifts. 
In  our  exercises and  meditations we  learn to  con­
sciously use  imprint, sensate, and  kinetic  ether in  the 
etheric doubles of  the  material, psychical, and  noetical 
bodies. 
First we  must discover what our etheric doubles are: 
to  feel  them, to  see  them, and  to  know them. Through 
introspection we can learn to perceive the different rates 
of vibration flowing between the material and the psychi­
cal  levels, and  between the  psychical and  the  noetical 
levels. Is  it  possible for  a  five-dimensional body - the 
noetical body - to concentrate energy into a three-dimen­
sional material body? Yes, through the  act  of  thinking. 
Rays of  Mind super-substance pass through the  etheric 

Understanding the Gates to the Light 
double of the noetical body, affecting the material brain, 
to excite a thought. Similarly, rays of Mind substance pass 
through the etheric double of the psychical body to create 
an emotion. 
In  our  everyday life,  we  think and  feel  according to 
the impressions received from the surroundings,  depend­
ing  on  the  disposition and  interest of  our  present-day 
personality. It is important to realise that when we allow 
negative impressions, as elementals, into out personality, 
we create psychical and physical illnesses. Through exer­
cise  we  observe the  flow of  energy, train ourselves to 
receive and create only positive elementals, and to release 
negative elementals into the cosmic consciousness. 
Thus we see the process of thinking and feeling, the 
interaction between the dimensions, and its effect on time 
and place living.

Tbe Seven Promises 
of  the Researchers of  the Truth 
I received, and hope always to receive, teaching and guid­
ance from my fa ther.  One of  the gifts I value most are the 
Seven Promises  of  the  Researcher  of  the  Truth.  These 
Promises were bestowed upon my fa ther,  when he was a 
child,  by  his Guide, and his entire life was grounded in the 
great truths of  these Promises. 
What makes  the Promises so precious to  me? When I 
fa ce problems, I hear my fa ther's voice, and the voice with­
in  me  whispering one  of  the  Promises. With  courage, 
strength, and wisdom, I am then able to master all trials. I 
fe el the presence of Beloved joshua, and of  my fa ther, bless­
ing my  every step. All  seekers would do well to contemplate 
daily the Seven Promises.  Follow the Promises  and soon 
your life will change fo r the better. 
I Promise To  Myself ... 
To serve at all times and in all places Absolute Beingness 
to whom I whole-heartedly belong. 
To  be ready at all times and in all places to serve the 
Divine Plan. 
To make good use of the Divine Gifts of thought and 
word at  all  times, in  all  places, and  under all  circum­
stances. 
To endure patiently, without complaining, all forms of 
trials and  tribulations which the  most wise Divine Law 
may bestow upon me. 
To  love and serve my fellow human beings sincerely 
from the  depths of  my  heart and  Soul, no  matter what 
their behaviour may be towards me. 
To  meditate and to  contemplate daily  Absolute 
Beingness, with the objective of total coordination of my 
thoughts, desires, words and actions with Its Divine Will. 
To  investigate and check every night whether all my 
thoughts, desires, words and actions are in absolute har­
mony with the Divine Law.

Meditation is easier in a quiet place. A prayer befo re med­
itating will help silence the mind. We  have to cleanse our 
hearts  befo re passing through  spiritual "gates". joshua 
teaches that befo re you  "bring thy gift to the  altar" be at 
peace with yourself and others (cf Matt. 5.23). 
Wh ile  many  like  to  meditate alone,  others prefer to 
gather fo r a  communal experience. Either way  is fine. I 
discourage anyone from practising  more than one deep 
exercise every few days. Find your own pace.  Tbere is  no 
need to hurry, fo r impatience will not help. It is impossible 
to lea  p into a   deep meditative state. I  advise you to work 
through this book from front to end. As you become fa mil­
iar  with  the exercises, feel free to pursue a particular line 
of  work. It may help you to keep a journal of your un  fold­
ing experiences. 
If you are  carrying  a   child,  or if you suffe r from a 
weak heart,  please use  caution. If an  exercise becomes 
uncomfo rtable,  discontinue  and  simply flood yourself 
with white light. For although all the exercises that fo llow 
are safe,  there is always a danger in concentrating energy 
on a foetus or a damaged heart.  We  never,  in any case, 
concentrate on the material heart. 
As some of  the exercises are quite long,  and therefo re 
diffi cult to remember, a friend may guide you through the 
steps.  All the exercises presented here,  and many others, 
will be recorded on audio cassette and available by  writ­
ing to the address in the front of  the book.

Preliminary Meditation 
Balancing the Bodies 
All  exercises within  this  book begin  with  a  Preliminary 
Meditation  to  shake  off  the  burdens  of  everyday  life, 
balance  our bodies, and prepare us  fo r  entrance  into 
higher states of  consciousness. 
When practiced alone Preliminary Meditation  is  a 
beneficial  morning  exercise  to  centre  the  personality, 
energise the  body,  and ready ourselves fo r the challenges 
of  the coming day. 
Preliminary Meditation 
Relax completely and feel your material body. We have to 
love and respect our bodies. .  .  .    they are a gift from our 
Father. Concentrate and feel your toes .  .  .   be fully aware 
that you are now in your toes. Breathe deeply and move 
very slowly up  to your knees. Feel and  see  your etheric 
double .  .  .    see  it  sparkle in  and  around your material 
body ... it is life. 
From your knees move slowly up  into  your solar 
plexus ... breathe deeply and concentrate in this centre. 
Inhale and  see  pure light -energy radiating from within 
your solar plexus throughout your whole body. Exhale, 
see all fear, doubt and darkness leave your body. 
Now, move up  to  your chest ... see  rosy light 
radiating from the  place of  your heart. Silence your 
emotions and your desires ... feel only love in your heart. 
Love life  .  .  .    love yourself .  .  .    love all  human beings, 
especially those who believe they are  your enemies. 
Expand the rosy light to cover the whole planet .  .  .    it is 
your temporary home. As  a  personality you  live on this 
planet ... as a Spirit-Soul, the planet lives in you. 
Move upwards and  see  a  golden sun  in  and around 
your head ... clear your thoughts. There are only creative 
thoughts in your mind now. See how the etheric double 
of  your material body is  shining and  sparkling in  white 
light ... look carefully and observe all the colours within 
the  white light. Breathe deeply and  wish good health to 
your body.

To build a psycho-noetical 
pyramid we visualise a square 
on the floor with triangles on 
each side. We close the pyramid 
by pulling up the triangles. 
The pyramid should  be three 
times your height.

Archangelic Attunement 
Wo rking within a Psycho-noetical 
Py ramid 
In many exercises the Preliminary Meditation is followed 
by  Archangelic Attunement. In this exercise we construct 
a psycho-noetical pyramid. The pyramid has been evoked 
across  the ages,  in  many cultures,  as a   sacred place, a 
protective workshop, fo r communion with Divine Beings. 
In Archangelic Attunement we learn to cooperate with our 
brothers,  the Archangels  of  the Elements. In  many cases 
Archangelic Attunement is fo llowed by  more specific work. 
Archangelic Attunement 
Begin  with  the Preliminary Meditation,  page 2 7,  and 
continue ...
Look to the floor with your etheric eyes. Use the white 
light of  your etheric double to  create a  square on  the 
floor. See, feel and hear energy  flow from the  fingers of 
your etheric hand as you fill the  square  with white light. 
Stand in the middle of the square.  Use your  etheric hand 
again to create a triangle in front of you ... create another 
triangle on the right side .  .  .    one on the left  .  .  . and one 
behind you.  Bring the four triangles together to  form a 
pyramid. It is three times your size, filled with white light. 
Breathe deeply  .  .  .  look in  front of  you and see 
golden light rising within the triangle.  This is the light of 
the Logos.  Bend your head in  reverence before His 
glorious light. 
On  your  right side see red flames rising within the 
triangle ... this is Archangel Michael. Open your palms to 
receive a  red flame.  Breathe deeply. Your etheric double 
is slowly filled with Michael's red light ... this light is not 
burning .  .  .    it purifies your blood. Thank Michael for his 
help. 
Look to the left side and see violet flames rising in this 
triangle .  .  .    this is Raphael. Open your palms to receive a 
violet flame.  Breathe deeply and see your  etheric double 
become violet .  .  . Raphael gives you the  etheric vitality 
and energy you need. Thank him for  his help. 
No  need to  turn around to  see the  triangle behind. 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
Sky-blue flames rise within it  ... here is Gabriel ... the 
most gentle and loving Archangel. He comes to  embrace 
you.  Breathe  deeply  and see your  etheric double filled 
with sky-blue light ... feel and see all the liquids in your 
body in harmony.  Gabriel brings peace to your psychical 
body.  Thank him for  his help. 
Breathe deeply  ... see silvery-white  mist rising from 
the  floor, first embracing your feet  and slowly reaching 
your  head. This is  Uriel,  the Great Balancer. Cooperate 
with him  and balance your bodies.  Your noetical body, 
your psychical body, and  your material body  are  in 
perfect harmony and peace.  Thank Uriel for his help. 
See the Archangels working in your bodies. Feel their 
love for  you .  .  . Michael gives us  fire and warmth .  .  . 
Raphael power  and strength .  .  . Gabriel peace and 
serenity  ... while Uriel brings balance and harmony. 
Listen to the beats of your heart  ... they  are  the voices of 
the Archangels telling you how much they love you.  Love 
yourself as they love you.  Breathe deeply. 
At this point you may either continue onward into the 
chosen meditation,  or  bring this session  to  a  close by 
relaxing and dissolving the pyramid.

with the "pulse of life".

The Pulse of  Life 
Visualisation of  Forms 
We  must learn to observe, to concentrate,  to visualise, and 
to meditate. As we are able to observe the outer world,  we 
can also observe the worlds within. 
Visualise a lemon in your hand. Feel it. Feel its weight. 
Touch it. Feel the skin. See its colour. How is it on the out­
side? On the inside? How do you  know,  if  your eyes  are 
closed, whether it is  a lemon or a  lime? Smell the lemon. 
What do you smell? Scratch the lemon.  What do you feel? 
Slice  the  lemon and squeeze  its juice into your mouth. 
What do you taste? 
Is  this  experience real  or  an illusion? It is  a  lasting 
reality in the worlds of  thought and feeling. In the materi­
al world I see a lemon, pick it off  a tree,  slice it and drink 
its juice.  The lemon is no longer. Yet,  I have stored this 
experience in my  memory where it remains with meforev­
er and ever. What is more  real - the outer or the inner 
experience? The material lemon or the lemon of  your so­
called imagination? 
God gives us Mind-light to use.  Us ing Mind conscious­
ly, we can learn to do many,  many things;  even to create 
fo od to feed people. 
The Pulse of  Life 
Begin with the Preliminary Meditation, page 2 7, fo llowed 
by Archangelic Attunement, page 28, and continue ... 
Breathe deeply. You have  to  become the master of 
your  three bodies. Feel  them ... listen to  what they are 
telling you. 
Look in  front  of  you and  see golden flames rising 
within the triangle. Now,  visualise a  golden triangle rest­
ing on  your shoulders  and reaching over your head.  See 
a  smaller golden triangle between your eyes ... this is 
a  gate through  which you can see the beloved Joshua. 
Bend your head in reverence. 
Breathe deeply. See His golden light come towards 
you and become one with you ... you are a shining light 
... can you feel His  smile in you? Can you feel His kiss? 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
His breath gives you life.  In  Him you can see the 
Wisdom, Power,  and Love.  Look at Him ... His eyes are 
mirrors .  .  . see yourself as you really  are.  Christ,  the 
Way, the Truth,  and the Life, "the true li   ght,  which lighteth 
every  man that cometh into  the world" Qohn 1:
9
). He  is 
Love,  and Love expressed becomes motion,  movement, 
and vibration;  the nature of life. Love is the pulse of life. 
Concentrate golden light  in your hands .  .  . feel  this 
light in your palms.  Now, see the light become an apple. 
Feel it ... touch it .  .  .    smell it. Take  a bite  and taste it ...
the  taste and the  smell  in your mouth become light-life. 
What is happening inside you . .  .  ? The fruit  becomes 
light. 
In your palms now use the golden light to visualise a 
bird.  A  beautiful, beautiful bird!  It's alive  ... touch it and 
feel it. It's a little frightened ... you can feel its heart flut­
ter. Reassure  it  by  gently saying,  "Calm down, you are 
safe. "  The feathers  are very, very  soft under its  wings. 
Look! It is scratching you now with  its little claws.  It  turns 
its  head to look at you ... see all the details. Play a  little 
with the bird.  Now,  open your palms and see it set flight. 
As you let it go,  ask it to  come back again.  See it return­
ing to you.  Caress it and let it go again ... you can call it 
back anytime. 
Look at your palms again.  Breathe deeply and see the 
golden light turn slowly into water ... crystal-clear water. 
Bring it to your mouth and drink it ... it becomes life and 
light in you! joshua said, "whosoever drinketh of  the water 
that I shall give him shall never thirst;  but the water that I 
shall give him shall be in him a well of  water springing up 
into everlasting life" Qohn 4:14). 
Now,  put your  palms on  the  place of your heart  ...
feel the  pulse of life  everywhere ... and pray; "Give us 
tbis day our daily bread" (Matt. 6:11). Slowly,  slowly dis­
solve the pyramid. Breathe deeply  and start  feeling your 
material body again:  your head .  .  . your  chest .  .  . your 
solar  plexus .  .  .  your thighs .  .  .  and  from  your knees 
down to your feet.

Seaside Meditation 
Experiencing the Archangels in  Nature 
We  know that the Archangels of  the El  ements are at work 
throughout all phenomena of  life,  including  our bodies. 
When I ask people to get in touch  with Michael through 
their  blood, and  to  see  their  etheric double  glow in 
Michael's red light,  many growfearf  ul. 
Therefo re,  in the beginning, people may find it easier 
to feel the Archangels through nature. The same principles 
are at work in  our bodies,  in  nature,  and throughout the 
cosmos. All phenomena of  life  are  composed of  the  ele­
ments of fire,  water, earth, and air. 
Attune yourself to the sun and you will attune yourself 
to Michael. 
Attune yourself to  the sea and you attune yourself to 
Gabriel. 
Attune yourself to the wind and you will be attuned to 
Raphael. 
Attune yourself to the harmony and balance in nature 
and you will be attuned to Uriel. 
Having seen and felt the Archangels through nature, 
we can then turn inward to see their work in our bodies. 
Seaside Meditation 
Begin  with  the  Preliminary Meditation,  page 2 7,  and 
continue ... 
Visualise a beautiful, warm day. You are sitting by the 
sea  .  .  .    feel the sun warming your body  .  .  . listen to the 
waves.  Notice the  small  stones and shells of  different 
colours  ... they are hot from the sun ... you can also see 
stones glistening in the water. As the water ebbs out,  after 
a  little  while, you see  them dry in  the heat of the sun. 
Inhale the  rich salt air ... breathe in the  iodine ... smell 
the many unique fragrances of the sea. 
As  waves break  on the  rocks, feel water spray  your 
face  ... you are a  happy human being.  You are walking 
barefoot towards the shore ... absorb the sun through the 
hot sand. Take  a  few steps into the  cool water .  .  . curl 
your toes into  the sand ... your feet sink in.  Walking into 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
the water,  feel the  sea embrace your legs ... as you enter 
deeper water,  the sea engulfs  your whole body.  You are 
swimming ... sense the resistance of the water ... plunge 
beneath  the  surface .  .  . feel and see  the  rays of the  sun 
passing through the water to reach your body. 
Dive deeper and see the  immense beauty under the 
sea ... all the life of the sea. You feel free, calm, and light 
... it is as if you were one with the water. Attune yourself
to Gabriel  .  .  .    become one with him .  .  .    feel the harmo­
ny.  At the  same time you are you ... you are breathing 
through  every pore of  your body.  Slowly float up. Let 
your head surface ... then the rest of your body. 
Float on  your back .  .  . allow  the 
�
alt water to  hold 
you and turn your face to  the sun.  Feel its  warmth .  .  . 
attune yourself with Michael .  .  . your  vibrations are 
changing. 
Feel the wind kiss your face ... attune yourself with 
Raphael and  feel yourself full of etheric vitality.  Come out 
of the sea ... lie down and let your body dry ... feel and 
hear the wind .  .  .    feel and hear the  sea .  .  .    listen to the 
water. Hear the  birds sing.  You are  one with everything 
... feel all of creation within you ... you have everything 
on this planet ... enjoy the gifts from our Father. 
You can  see Michael working with Gabriel  and 
Raphael in your bodies ... feel them as they work in per­
fect unity ... you are  healthy and strong.  True happiness 
is cooperating with the Archangels. 
A  golden ray embraces you.  If you look at this light, 
you will see it as a  six-pointed star. You are lying upon a 
bed of golden light! You are  blessed. Attune yourself to 
Absolute Beingness through the  beloved Son ... become 
one with Joshua. His vibrations are your vibrations. He is 
talking to you.  Hear, fe
e'! 
and understand ... it is a beau­
tiful teaching ... and it is your inner nature; "/am with 
you alway, even unto the end of  the world"(Matt. 28:20).
Breathe deeply .   .  . feel  the Love of  Absolute 
Beingness in your heart.  Keep it there.  Slowly, slowly feel 
your material body again. 
The vibrations, lights, and 
colours of the Archangels of the 
Elements can be experienced 
throughout nature.

A  Wh ite Lily 
Attunement to Forms 
My  fa ther always  asked me to  check and observe every­
thing. He  used to say that since we live on this planet we 
should  know this  home of  ours.  The  animal,  ve getable, 
and mineral  kingdoms are part  of  our nature.   I have 
learned that in order to attune myself to nature,  I have to 
lower  my vibrations.   And when  I attune myself to  the 
Archangels, Virgin Mary,  and joshua- at  higher frequen­
cies- I  understand my divine nature. 
Why  attune ourselves to a flower? It  is a way to know 
everything about the flower. We  will even know how flow­
ers feel. Eventually we will learn to respect and care fo r all 
of  nature. 
A  Wh ite Lily 
Begin  with  the  Preliminary Meditation,  page 2 7,   and 
continue .. . 
Visualise a  white lily  in  your etheric hands .  .  . see 
every detail.  Feel the firm stem and tender leaves .  .  . 
caress the  silky,  snow-white petals ... breathe in its scent 
... touch the centre and see how the grainy pollen sticks 
to your fingers. 
Excluding all  other thought, concentrate your entire 
attention on the flower. You will feel the vibrations of the 
flower are different from your own.  Slow your breathing 
down .  .  .    lower your vibrations .  .  .    and gradually attune 
yourself to the flower. 
Enter the  flower and see it  from  inside .  .  . observe 
everything there ... slowly become one with the lily. You 
can see many, many  details ... observe  the  structure of 
the fibres .  .  . see the  liquids  gently moving .  .  . you  are 
inside the flower! The flower speaks of God's Wisdom. An 
entire  universe  is in there and you are within  it. Witness 
the work of the Archangels. The flower - in form, colour, 
and smell - is in you  .  .  .  and  you  are in it. "Consider the 
lilies how they grow: they toil not,  they sp in not; and yet I 
say  unto  you, that Solomon  in  all  his  glory was  not 
arrayed like one of these"(Luke 12:27). 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
Begin to breathe normally ... slowly raise your vibra­
tions to  your human nature.  The flower is  still in  your 
hands.  But now it looks different as you know all about it. 
Give  the lily  a   taste of your energy  .  .  . see it reacting to 
your vibrations ... it is trembling.   Feel it ... it speaks to 
you through its vibrations ... it is the language of life  ...
the language of  love.  Listen and learn.  Give  this flower 
your love and appreciation.  Ask yourself:  who am I who 
can do all  this? I can  attune myself to anything and be at­
one with everything .  .  . knowing who I am as a  Spirit­
Soul, I know how to behave as a  personality. 
With all your love offer the lily to the world .  .  .    wish 
that peace,  love and understanding prevail across the 
globe ... from heart to heart ... from country to country. 
Breathe deeply  ... balance your  bodies ... and slowly 
feel your material body again.

Many Kinds of  Love 
Understanding our Feelings 
"Though I speak with the tongues of  men and of  angels, 
and have not love,  I am  become as sounding brass,  or a 
tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, 
and understand all  mysteries, and all  knowledge;  and 
though I have all fa ith, so that I could remove mountains, 
and have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all
my goods to feed the poor, and though I give  my  body to be 
burned,  and have not love,  it profiteth  me nothing. Love 
suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth 
not itself,  is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseem­
ly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,  thinketh no 
evil; Rejoiceth  not in iniquity,  but rejoiceth in the truth; 
Beareth  all things,  believeth all things,  hopeth all things, 
endureth all things. Love never fa ileth:  but whether there 
be prophecies,  they sh  all fa il;  whether there  be  tongues, 
they shall cease; whether there be knowledge,  it shall van­
ish away. For we know in part,  and we prophesy  in part. 
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is 
in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as 
a child,  I underst ood as a   child,  I thought as a   child:  but 
when I became a  man,  I  put away childish  things. For 
now we see through a glass, darkly;  but then fa ce to fa ce: 
now I know in part;  but then shall I  know even as also I 
am known. And now abideth fa ith, hope, love, these three; 
but the greatest of  these is love" (1 Corinthian s 13: 1-13). 
Many Kinds of  Love 
Begin with the Preliminary Meditation, page 27, fo llowed 
by Archangelic Attunement, page 28, and continue ... 
Look into the triangle of golden light in front of you. 
Feel the  vibration of the  light ... feel Love coming from 
this light ... see our beloved Joshua ... the  humble King 
.  .  . the King of Kings .  .  . Light from Light .  .  . true  God 
from true God. 
Look at Him ... see His loving smile ... feel His gen­
tle  touch. Allow His eyes to  be a  mirror in which to see 
yourself. What kind of Love is His? Enter His golden light 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
... see who you are now ... you are the light ... a seed 
from His heart. Go to the centre of your Beingness .  .  .    to 
the  centre  of life  and creation .  .  . to  the  centre  of love! 
What kind of love is this? 
Slowly concentrate the golden light in  the place of 
your heart ... in His heart we are  all one ... in our hearts 
we  have to  be  one with one another.  Visualise,  in  the 
palms of your etheric hands,  a   red rose. Smell it  ... touch 
its petals .  .  .    they are like velvet.  Carefully run your fin­
gers  over  the leaves  and thorns.  Look! On one of  the 
petals there is a drop of water ... clear water in the shape 
of a  heart. 
Bring into your mind a  person you love .  .  .    you feel 
a  special  kind of love for  this person .  .  . offer him the 
rose. He sees his face reflected in  the  drop of water ...
and he can see the love in your heart. What kind of love 
is this? Offer a rose to your father ... what kind of love is 
that? Offer a rose to your mother ... what kind of love is 
that? Give one to your brother or your sister ... what kind 
of love is that? When you give a rose to a friend ... what 
kind of  love is  that? When you give a  rose to  a  person 
with whom you have problems ... what kind of love is 
that? And when you think of the children ... what kind of 
love is that? What  kind of love do you offer as  a  present­
day personality? What kind of love is in a  Spirit-Soul-Self?
_-\s  a  personality  you can love other human beings in 
many ways,  but as a  Spirit-Soul-Self you share love with 
everyone, without distinction. 
See everyone as a Spirit-Soul-Self. "Thou shalt love the 
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and 
zrith all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neigh­

A Crystal Cavern 
Distinguishing Different Energies 
Crystals provide a medium to work gently,  as present-day 
personalities,  with the  Archangels  of  the  Elements. 
Wo rking, through visualisation, within a  crystal cavern 
we feel the vibrations of  the Archangels as and when we 
are ready. 
Let me give you an example. The first time I tried to 
give energy to my body, feeling weak and in pain, I only 
increased my  suffering. I did not know how to control the 
healing energy and so I took too much! With the visualisa­
tion of  an emerald-green crystal pillar a person can safely 
take the quantity of  energy he needs. In due course, he will 
be  able  to  control  the process,  relating directly to  the 
Archangels.  The  Archangels,  of  course,  know what we 
need, but we too should know! 
In this exercise you will feel the warmth of Michael, the 
electricity of  Raphael,  and the cool softness  of  Gabriel in 
your own rhythm, all balanced by  Uriel. 
A Crystal Cavern 
Begin  with  the  Preliminary Meditation,  page 2 7, and 
continue ... 
Visualise a  glistening cavern before you.  Enter into 
this cavern and  see it  filled with crystal formations of 
every kind.  Most remarkable are a number of large crystal 
pillars  radiating white light. 
Go towards  one ... feel  its vibrations as you near it. 
Without touching the crystal,  carefully place your  etheric 
hands close to it ... feel the energy. Inside the pillar there 
is movement ... life.  Red light becomes gradually visible 
as flames rise within the crystal pillar ... the sound of the 
vibration gives us his name .  .  . it  is Archangel Michael. 
Notice how the energy  in  your  body changes .  .  . feel 
warmth circulating  in your bloodstream. Thank Michael 
for  the experience. 
Now,  go towards another pillar ... notice its  energy 
field as you approach.  Place your hands close to  it,  again 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
without touching, and feel the energy  grow stronger. 
Sense its  internal movement as electricity, as power. See 
violet light rise from within the pillar, with ever increasing 
intensity.  You can hear his  name ... it  is  Archangel 
Raphael.  Observe the difference between his frequencies 
and those of Michael.  Thank Raphael for  his presence. 
Now,  go  towards  a third pillar ... feel cool,  gentle, 
sky-blue waves coming from it as  you approach.  Sense 
the  liquids in your body flowing harmoniously  .  .  . you 
can feel  and hear his name ... it is Gabriel's energy. What 
are the differences between his frequencies  and those of 
Raphael  and of Michael? Thank Gabriel for this joy. 
Go to a  fourth  pillar ... it is filled with silvery-white 
light ... touch it ... it is Uriel' s vibrations.  How are your 
bodies  reacting? It  is  as  if  suddenly everything fell into 
place ... you are balanced! Thank Uriel for  the harmony. 
Gradually allow yourself to explore the other pillars in 
the  crystal cavern.  Soon you will come to  a  crystal  that 
holds healing frequencies.  As you touch it you see emer­
ald  light rising within it  .  .  .  feel how it  works in  your 
material body ... releasing all  pain and suffering. 
Then you are drawn to a very special pillar ... you are 
entering a field of golden light ... breathe deeply ... feel 
the vibration ... it is the Christ-light. The light expands and 
:'preads throughout the crystal cavern ... feel how differ­
ent  His vibration is!  His divine vibration affects  your 
;>ersonality .  .  . lifting you into heavenly frequencies . .  .

Archangelic Five-pointed Stars 
"For he shall give his angels charge over thee,  to keep   thee 
in all thy ways" (Psalm 91: 11). 
People wear talismans fo r protection and good fo r­
tune.  By  consciously  constructing five-pointed stars  on 
our etheric doubles  we,  ourselves, become powerfu l talis­
mans. 
When we spread out our arms and legs we see that we 
fo rm a five-pointed star.  Our symbol has two points down­
ward (our legs), two to the sides (our ar  ms), and one point 
up  (our he  ad). Tbis star represents  the human fo rm  in 
perfection. An  upside  down five-pointed star is an evil 
symbol, denigrating the sacred human fo rm. 
We  can  work with  the Archangels of  the Elements to 
fo rm five-pointed  stars fo r  our protection and general 
well-being. 
If I  need to improve the condition of  my  blood, I  create 
the star with Michael's red light on my  etheric double. 
When I am in need of  energy, I work with Raphael,  the 
Archangel of power, energy and strength, by  constructing 
a five-pointed star of  violet light. 
If I  feel vulnerable,  or if I   have problems controlling 
my  emotions,  to whom do I attune myself? To  Archangel 
Gabriel,  by  creating a five-pointed star in sky- blue light. 
In  the psychical and noetical universes we ca  n fo rm 
five-pointed stars on the etheric doubles of  the correspond­
ing bodies fo r heav enly work as invisible helpers. 
After  constructing five-pointed stars    on  our etheric 
doubles,  we can visualise ourselves embedded in the cen­
tre  of  a  larger six-pointed star   of  golden  light.  Tbe six­
pointed star is constructed of  two overlapping triangles: an 
upward directed triangle expressing our divine nature, 
and  a  downward pointing  triangle ::,ymbolising our 
descent into the wo rlds of  sepa ration. 
Placed  in the  middle  of  a  six-pointed star,    we feel 
attuned  to  our divine nature,  always  in  Him, and He 
always in us.

across your body, until your right arm is fully extended off 
your right side and level with your shoulders. 
Breathe deeply and  move your right arm across your 
chest, in a straight line,  and continue as far as it will go off 
your left  side.  Visualise a  line of  red light projecting 
beyond your hand, to form a  line that extends equally off 
your sides. From there continue  the  motion, in a  straight 
line,  down to your right foot.  Raise your hand from your 
right foot to the point of origin over your head, thus com­
pleting a five-pointed star. 
You are now surrounded by  a  five-pointed star of 
radiant red light ... within it your etheric double shines. 
Breathe deeply .  .  . be  aware of  Michael's presence in 
your warm red blood and around you  as  a protective 
shield. Thank Michael for his help. A  large six-pointed star

hear the  light pour from your hands as you construct the 
five-pointed star on  your etheric double.  From the  point 
above your head,  simultaneously lower your right arm 
down to your right foot,  and your left  arm down to your 
left foot, marking two straight diagonal lines of bright sky­
blue light. Next, raise both etheric hands to extend off their 
opposite  side - the  left  goes off  the right side,  while the 
right extends off the !eft side - creating two straight inter­
secting lines.  Breathe  deeply .  .  . you have your arms 
crossed over your heart  centre with your etheric hands 
projecting streams of sky-blue light about two feet off each 
side.  Unfold your etheric arms and extend them off  their 
sides to form a horizontal line level with your shoulders. 
You are now surrounded by a five-pointed star of sky­
blue light ... your etheric double is shining within it.

Within  Absolute Beingness  our individuality,  our Holy 
Monadic Ego,  is never extinguished. We  are each self-con­
scious Sp irit-Souls.  On  the  material plane, many people 
enjoy the idea that they are separate,  autonomous people, 
who can have little or no   contact with others. Many  of  us 
keep a distance,  believing that the suffering of  others has 
nothing to do with us. 
Even so-called sp iritual people believe that when oth­
ers,  including young  children, are suffering hardship -
quite extreme in developing  countries - it is  "good" fo r 
them to learn bitter lessons through their "karma". This is 
a very crude understanding of  the Divine Plan. Afeast on 
a table should not cause fa mine in the heart. 
The root of  all malady  in this world  stems from the 
fa lse  and  tragic  belief that we  are  separate from  one 
another  because of  wealth, education, gender, age, 
nationality,  religion, or  the colour of  our skin.  Plagues, 
warfare,  drought, and eart  hquakes  care  little about the 
size of your wallet. We  share a  common home, and more­
over, a common experience. The Source is the sa me fo r us 
all,  and the road home is one. The Common Selfhood is 
our highest nature.  Some  know and express this  truth 
already,  and one day all will live consciously in it. 
Tbe Common Seljhood

Breathe the  light from the triangle in front of you.  In 
the place of your heart visualise a shining six-pointed star 
of golden light.  Breathe deeply and see  people all  over 
the world ... each one of them has a shining six-pointed 
star of golden light, the Christ-light,  on his heart.  Feel the 
beats of  your heart ·.  .  .    feel  the beats of  their hearts. 
Breathe deeply ... slowly, slowly the golden light from all 
the hearts becomes one ... Christ is in each of us ... and 
we are all one in Him. 
Breathe deeply and concentrate on  the triangle of 
golden light in front of you.  With the golden light, create 
an  upright triangle that rests  on your shoulders  and 
extends up over your head. Visualise a smaller upright tri­
angle between your eyes,  also of luminous golden light. 
Joshua, the gentle, loving King,  is coming towards you ...
bend your head in  reverence and receive  His blessing. 
Can you  feel His Love? The Wisdom and Purity  radiating 
from Him? Do you see the  beauty  of His face? His sim-

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
plicity? His presence gives you strength,  peace,  and faith. 
Look at Him ... hear Him ... He  is guiding you.  Hold 
Him in your heart and learn.  Humbly give yourself to His 
service. Breathe deeply  and feel Joshua in  your human 
form .  .  . His arms are  in your arms .  .  .    wings of golden 
light are embracing you ... His heart is in your heart giv­
ing  you the pulse of  life.  You are seeing the world 
through His beautiful soft green eyes ... you are embrac­
ing the world through His hands.  His heart eases the pain, 
fear and suffering of all people. Every beat of your heart 
speaks of His  Love for you,  let it also speak of your love 
for all fellow human beings.  He is asking you to "love one 
another, as I have loved you" (John 1
5
:12). He never criti­
cises you ... He only shows  you the Way ... you have 
complete freedom ... "A nd ye shall know the truth, and 
the truth shall make you free" (John 8:
3
2). See Him ... He 
is  smiling .  .  . He is  pleased .  .  . His mission was not in 
vain.  Watch Him return to from where He came.  Yet, He 
remains in you always and forever. 
Feel the beats of your heart again ... feel the beats of 
the hearts of all other people. Feel their beats in the same 
rhythm as  your own .  .  . and be  one with one another 
always . .  .   "So  we,  being many,  are one body in Christ, 
and every one members one of  another" (Rom. 12:
5
). 
On this planet, as present-day personalities,  we have 
to walk hand in hand on this beautiful but painful  jour­
ney.  See yourself as  a  separate personality  again,  yet 
connected to  the whole of  humanity.    Feel your own 
heartbeat .  .  . breathe deeply .  .  . balance your bodies. 
Slowly,  slowly dissolve the  pyramid.  Feel your material 
body  again: your head ... your  chest ... your abdomen 
.  .  .    your thighs .  .  . and from your knees down to your 
toes. 
The absolute unity of the 
seeming diversity;   "At that day 
ye shall know that I am in my 
Father, and ye in me, and 
I  in you" (John 14:20).

Attunement to Vi rgin Mary 
In the Embrace of  the Heavenly Mother 
When I asked my fa ther,  "What does the Virgin Mary rep­
resent?, " he said,  "She is the pan-universal fe mininity,  the 
perfect woman, the perfect mother of  us  all.  She  is the 
Queen  of  the  Heavens  and the Mother of  Heaven  and 
Earth." 
It  is  natural that we  try  to be  like  those  we  idolise. 
However, as much as I love and admire Virgin Mary, it is 
not possible to be her. She is she, and I am I.  Yet,  we can try 
to see things the way she sees them, to feel and act the way 
she feels and acts. In  her eyes,  her fa ce,  her heart there is 
infinite peace, power, strength, and kindness. 
Tbere are no words which can properly describe what 
or who  Virgin Mary is, fo r doing so would reduce her to 
human measures.  For  me she   is  the  heart holding  all 
humanity. In meditation we can see her in all her glory. 
Attunement to  Vi rgin Mary 
Begin with the Preliminary Meditation, page 27, fo llowed 
by  Archangelic Attunement, page 28, and continue ...
Now, stand before the golden triangle and allow your­
self to  be filled with this light .  .  . see it  .  .  . feel it  .  .  . 
attune yourself to it. 
Feel the presence of Virgin Mary  ... allow  her love 
and light to wash over you ... look at her ... her fig­
ure  is radiating light ... she is luminous and translucent 
.  .  . her face and hands glow in  rosy brilliance.  She is 
dressed in a white robe ... a sky-blue stole hangs down 
from her shoulders .  .  . notice the rosary  on  the right 
side of her belt ... each bead a living prayer of love for 
all her children. Sense her wisdom and love ... see and 
feel her smile ... her eyes are beautiful pools of calm­
ness .  .  . you can enter them as  you would  enter a 
peaceful port.  Feel yourself comforted in these tranquil 
waters .  .  . in her arms you know that you can rest .  .  . 
open yourself to  her soft  embrace .  .  . she gives you 
strength and serenity. Allow yourself to feel her protec­
tion ... nothing can ever disturb  you again! You are 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
both  in  heaven and on  Earth.  Nourish  yourself in  this 
feeling. 
Now,  go back in time ... to Palestine ... and  see her 
as the  mother of Joshua: always poised ... grateful ...
smiling sweetly ... understanding everything and every­
one ... never complaining ... never angered ... always 
sharing even the little she had. When she suffered the 
greatest pain  that any woman can endure - the  death of 
her beloved child - she lived the  sorrow with grace  and 
dignity  .  .  . quietly accepting the Will of God. 
Ask her to teach you to trust in God as she did, calm­
ly  and absolutely. Wish to  live  self-consciously, without 
complaint, knowing that you will come through each trial 
stronger,  filled with more understanding and compassion, 
even towards those who cause you grief ... "I promise to 
myself to endure patiently,  without complaining, all fo rms 
of  trials and tribulations which the most wise Divine Law 
may bestow upon me." 
Recompose your human personality.  Keep the  sweet­
ness and freshness of  the Holy Mother within you. 
Dissolve  the  pyramid,  and return slowly,  slowly to  your 
world .  .  .    breathe deeply and begin to feel your material 
body  again:  your head .  .  . your chest .  .  . your  solar 
plexus .  .  .    your thighs .  .  .    and from your knees down to 
your feet. 
The white lily, the symbol of 
the Virgin Mary, is a sign of 
perfect love, and the union of

Attunement to Christ 
Let There Be Light 
When I am  asked if I can see God with my material eyes, I 
have to answer 'yes". I see  God in all phenomena of  life: 
animals,  plants,  minerals,  and  especially  in  human 
beings,  even in their present-day personalities. I see  God 
all in all,  in everything. 
I also see Him  through the eyes  of  my  Soul. I am a 
Sp irit-Soul-Self an  individual,  a   ray  of  the divine light, 
without any limits. I see  myself incarnated into the mate­
rial world,  with its limits. 
We  are here to learn, incarnation by  incarnation.  We 
come ·together  with  others  in  order to  learn from  one 
another.  We  are all students as well as teachers. We  have 
to  transmute  the  present-day  personality  into  the 
Permanent Personality.  Our real Self  the Sp irit-Soul-Self 
inspires and draws us up . 
Two thousand years ago in Palestine,  the Son of  God, 
the  Son  of  Man -  perfect  God,  perfect human being -
incarnated  and  thereby  honoured  the  human form. 
joshua came to reveal to  us our God-nature and to show 
us the way back, as He is "the way,  the truth, and the life" 
(john 14:6). 
Through meditation we  begin,  step by  step,  to attune 
our present-day personality to our Permanent Personality, 
which is  unified  in  our Sp irit-Soul-Self at peace  in  the 
Christ-light,  at-one in the Christhood.

your chest .  .  .    your solar plexus  .  .  . your thighs .  .  .    and 
from your knees down to your feet.

Cleaning  the Temple 
Healing Yo urself 
Each universe, each world,  and every plane is governed by 
its own set of laws. In  his lessons, my fa ther tried to help us 
understand the laws of  life.  "If,  fo r example, " he  taught, 
"on the material plane you throw a stone up  in the air and 
it comes down upon your head,  are you entitled to com­
plain to God? Have you been unjustly punished? Do you 
want God to suspend the law of  gravity to spare you  the 
consequences of your stupidity?" 
In  conducting  our lives  we  all  make  mistakes and, 
therefo re, suffe r various injuries. Such injuries settle in the 
noetical, psychical and physical bodies. 
When you find yourself troubled with a problem it is 
best to start work on yourself, rather than sitting helplessly 
cursing life and God.  See what you  have  been doing  to 
your bodies. Study the emotions,  desires, and fixed-ideas 
in your personality. 
When you are experiencing an uncomfo rtable physi­
cal sensation - a sour stomach, an  aching  head - stop 
and study the matter befo re setting off  to a pharmacy or 
doctor's offi ce. Go to the source of  the problem instead of 
burying it in your bodies. Usually you will find that you 
can trace the discomfo rt back to elementals you have been 
creating or revitalising,  along  with elementals  that you 
have been accepting from others. Learn to  replace nega­
tive elementals with positive ones,  and you will find your­
self less encumbered. 
If you allow your desires and thoughts  to control you, 
you quickly become enslaved to them. How is it possible to 
become the master? Use reason and love in your thoughts; 
self-consciously create your desires, and control your emo­
tions.  Only when you use reason in your personality and 
accept responsibility fo r your life,  can you call it yours. 
The Archangels are working ceaselessly in our bodies 
to keep them healthy and strong,  so that we may enjoy  a 
comfortable existence. We  have to learn to stop interfe ring 
with their holy work and consciously cooperate with them.

Cleaning the Temple 
Begin  with  the  Preliminary Meditation,  page 27, and 
continue ... 
With your etheric eyes look carefully at your material 
form.  Breathe  deeply .  .  . it  is  as  if you were outside of 
your body and studying it. 
Your body is a perfect temple of God, a great gift. It is 
yours  to  live  in,  and yours to  live  through. Your body  is 
translucent ... you are able to observe its inner structure. 
Very slowly examine every detail starting from the feet up. 
See the skeleton from all angles .  .  .    see the rich network 
of veins and arteries.  Study  the rhythm of the heart ... the 
flowing blood .  .  . the delicate intricacy  of the nervous 
system. Turn your attention to the organs.  See the liver ...
the spleen ... the stomach ... the kidneys.  If any organ 
is  weak or  distressed, breathe deeply and visualise it 
flooded in  golden light, the Christ-light.   The light 
surrounds and penetrates the organ to absorb  all illness. 
Breathe deeply.  Examine your lungs ... observe how 
the compartments expand and contract with every breath 
you take.  As fresh air is drawn in,  your blood is fed with 
rich oxygen.  The liquids moving about the lungs  emit 
sparkling lights in  a  vast array of colours.   Now, look at 
your heart  .  .  . study  each chamber. Breathe  deeply and 
watch the  pumping of the  heart  send blood throughout 
the entire body, producing more light and colour, life and 
love.  Move up  to  your head. As  blood travels through 
minute vessels the brain shines in  its  own light ... it  is 
bright and clear light.  Now, see your entire body.  The 
etheric double is  shining,  sparkling with the  Christ -light, 
saturating the material body with etheric vitality.  Visualise 
all 
atoms,  molecules and cells glowing in radiant light ...
light is  everywhere!  In  the heart  it  purifies desires and 
emotions .  .  . in  the  head it  inspires understanding and 
dear-thinking.   The golden Christ-light responds to 
dissolve  all  darkness,  all  distress and illness .  .  . leaving 
your temple  clean and luminous. 
See, feel,  and hold this picture of perfection in your 
mind.  Thank the  Holy Trinity and the Archangels for the 
gift of life. "Thank you God,  my  body is Yo ur temple! A 
perfect gift to me. I will keep   it always healthy. I  shall never 
lose fa ith in You. Even in times of great pain and despair I 
submit to Your Will, Heavenly Father ... I  know that Your 
breath of  Life  is  always  in me. I shall love the Lord,  my 
God,  with all my  heart,  and all my Soul,  and with all my 
mind. Thy  Will be done." Breathe deeply ... feel yourself 
completely in your material body. 
Visualise the organs of the 
body bathed in the healing 
Christ-light.

Distant Healing 
Sending Healing Energy 
From  time to  time,  as present-day personalitie��  we feel 
miserable and sorry fo r ourselves. How can we help others 
when we feel so small and helpless? 
We  cannot work properly  on  material, psychical,  or 
noetical  bodies unless  we see  ourselves as incorruptible 
Sp irit-Soul-Selves. Knowing who and what we are - pure, 
eternal Holy  Monadic Egos  - we  are  able  to  work on 
ourselves and others to heal bodies and personalities. 
We  must use reason, wisdom, knowledge, and love.  We 
have  to  adapt and apply  into  everyday life  the  wisdom 
and love  we  experience while attuni ng  to  Christ.  Only 
then, will we know how to behave on this planet. Meditate, 
work,  and experience. 
We  can help individuals,  communities,  and even the 
entire planet,  by  creating and sending  healing  ba  lls  of 
light. Generally it is preferable to send white light and let 
the  Archangels  take from  this  light  whatever  colour is 
needed, the  hue  depending  on  the particular circum­
stances where help is required. Later, as we   learn more, we 
can  work  directly  by  sending light  balls  of  different 
colours. Use care, fo r by  sending the wrong colour we can 
do Ja r more harm than good. 
As a rule,  white li ght provides protection. Golden light 
assists reasonable thinking. Sky-blue light helps calm psy­
chical conditions.  Emerald-green light  works  to  release 
pain in the material body. Orange light helps regulate the 
thyroid, while red light strengthens the blood. 
When seeking to help others with distant healing,  we 
must keep   in mind a few things. First,  it is vital that the 
help has been requested, fo r we should never work without 
having consent. Second,  we are only allowed to intervene 
according to the Law of  God, fo r it is not  we who heal,  but 
the Almighty. And finally,  befo re working,  clean your per­
sonality  and  invite  the  Logos and Holy  Sp irit  to  work 
through yo  u.

Begin with the Preliminary Meditation, page 27, fo llowed 
by Archangelic Attunement, page 28,  and continue ...
In front of you,  see the triangle radiating golden light 
.  .  . it  is  Absolute Beingness and Christ Logos.  Breathe 
deeply.  With golden light create an  upright triangle that 
rests on your shoulders  and extends up over your head. 
Visualise a  smaller upright triangle between your eyes, 
also of  luminous golden light.  Through these two 
triangles attune  yourself to  the divine light  in the  large 
triangle before you. 
Breathe the golden light.  Open your etheric  hands. 
Concentrate light in your palms.  As  you inhale,  the  light 
begins to  form spheres,  one  in each hand .  .  . full  of 
energy ... full of power ... full of love. With your etheric 
eyes look at the balls.  They are so bright ... they are full 
of healing light.  Start  sending these spheres away.  Watch 
them go! 
As the balls leave your palms new ones are formed. 
Observe  how you are cooperating with the Archangels 
... isn't it beautiful to work with the Archangels to help 
others? See the  balls - each a  prayer - multiplying into 
millions and millions of  balls of  brilliant healing light. 
They continue to go and spread in all directions ... they 
are full of power and energy ... they know exactly where 
they are needed. Breathe deeply. More and more of them 
come from your palms .  .  . they spread until they cover 
the whole planet! Pray that this light will help to heal the 
whole planet. 
We  have such a  beautiful home,  let's no longer spoil 
it.  Wish that there be  no more pain,  no  more tears,  no 
more bloodshed .  .  . wish that there be  peace  on earth. 
See people smiling.  Visualise the  light pouring over them 
... helping them to  see  clearly  ... helping them to  see 
the truth.  This is the light of God, spreading love in their 
hearts  and reason in  their thoughts .  .  . healing their 
wounds ... bringing comfort in their sorrow. 
Breathe deeply and pray: "0 Merciful One. You spread
out Your hands on  the cross, and you gathered together 
the Nations that were fa r from You so that they may glorify 
Your great goodness." 
Dissolve  the  pyramid. Slowly,  slowly come back.  See 
yourself in your material body  again.  Breathe deeply and 
feel your head .  .  . your chest .  .  . your solar plexus . 
your thighs .  .  .    your knees and  down into your toes. 
When pure  light passes through 
a prism a spectrum of colour 
emerges. Balls of light, sent with 
love, help heal.

A Clean  Wh ite Robe 
Purifying Our Bodies 
Many people wish to wear the white robe of  initiation and 
purity. In fa ct we all have white robes,  much more beauti­
ful than an  y material robe you can ever wear. The point is 
to keep this white robe spotless. 
When  the present-day personality  reaches  a state  of 
balance,  the  three bodies are  in  harmony,  the  etheric 
doubles are filled with vitality, and the energy  centres are 
luminous;  then the li  ght of  the Sp irit-Soul shines through 
and our fo rm gleams in a white robe. 
Time and place experiences inevitably stain our robes. 
When  we  act  out of  the  impure  emotions  of  jealousy, 
malice,  envy,  or fixed-ideas and wayward principles,  we 
bring injury    to  our  material, psychical,  and  noetical 
bodies. When counter-positive energy passes through our 
centres,  our bodies become ill,  and our white robes soiled. 
As the centres are the gates  through which energy enters 
the bodies, they are also the doors from which it passes out 
of the body. 
In this exercise we work on several levels. After shaping 
our body into the fo rm of  an upright triangle, we will visu­
alise golden flames clearing out any problem.  We  can 
even become the flame and use the triangle- a  symbol of 
the Holy Trinity-  to become unified with our higher states 
of  being. 
A Clean  Wh ite Robe 
Begin  with  the  Preliminary Meditation,  page 2 7, and 
continue ... 
Look down with your etheric eyes and see a  white 
floor.  You are  dressed in white light ... your luminous 
etheric double is shining like a white robe. 
Breathe deeply. With your etheric hands together and 
out-stretched before you,  mark a point on the floor.  From 
this point use your left hand to slowly draw a straight line 
of golden light along your left side to a point behind you. 
See, feel,  and hear the  light pour from your hand.  Now, 
with your right hand construct an identical line along your 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
right side.  Breathe deeply and visualise the golden light 
forming a  third line,  connecting the  two points  behind 
you. You are now standing in the centre of an equal-sided 
triangle, each side measuring about 10 feet in length.  It is 
radiating pure golden light ... yet the floor remains white. 
Place your legs apart. Bring your hands to your chest 
.  .  . your left  hand over your right lung, and your right 
hand over your heart.  Your entire body  forms a  large 
standing triangle, extending from above your head down 
to your feet. 
See yourself dressed in a  white robe.  Breathe deeply 
and see golden flames rise from the triangle on which you 
stand ... from the right side ... from the left side ... and 
from behind you. They slowly rise ... caressing your feet 
... and continuing upwards.  As  the  flames rise  they fill 
your body with fire and light, which are not burning,  but 
cleansing.  You are within a blazing triangle. 
If any dark spots  remain on  your robe work  with 
yourself, use the light to clean your thoughts with reason 
... and the fire  to make your heart pure with love.  Turn 
within and find peace.  Work  until you feel completely 
calm .  .  . work until your white robe is  shining  without 
blemish. 
The triangle around your head is  brilliant .  .  . study 
what  is happening to  you.  The light from below  purifies 
your bodies ... and now,  from above your head, comes 
light ... a golden stream of light pulling you up ... hear 
Joshua's promise, "I  will draw all men unto  me" Qohn 
12:32). Can you hear Him? Can you see Him? Can you feel 
Him? Observe everything around you ... and everything in 
you.  What kind of work is now possible? Ask Joshua ...
and be still and listen. 
In  the place of  your heart  there is  golden light. 
Breathe deeply and see it glowing ... "I promise to myself 
to make good use of  the Divine Gifts  of  thought and word 
at all times,  in all places and under all circumstances." 
Keep a quiet mind ... and  a pure  heart.  Remember what 
your mission is  on this planet ... and what it may be in 
other dimensions. 
Dissolve the  triangle on the  floor .  .  .  and keep your 
robe pure,   brilliant, and shining in  white light.  Breathe 
deeply and feel your material body again:  feel your head 
.  .  .    your chest .  .  .    your solar plexus .  .  .    your thighs .  .  . 
and from your knees down to your feet. 
In the golden Christ-light we 
purify our emotions, desires, 
and thoughts.

Body and Soul 
Looking into a   Crystal-clear Mirror 
With  this exercise we explore our existence, as a present­
day personality,  through the construction of  triangles on 
our etheric doubles.  The work is to understand the perfec­
tion of  the human fo rm and to instill true self-awareness. 
Using the two etheric centres over our shoulders to fo rm the 
base,  we  create three  upward directed triangles, and a 
fo urth  triangle descending down over the chest.  The two 
centres, situated just over our shoulders, are very powerfu l 
and can  be understood to represent our Logoic (over the 
right shoulder) and Holy Sp iritual (over the left)  aspects. 
The first triangle we construct will have its pinnacle on 
the  thyroid centre.  The thyroid,  in  comparison to other 
energy centres, is small in size but no less vital to our well­
being.  We  never seek  to  develop  or  enlarge  the  thyroid, 
rather we work harmoniously with this small and perfect 
disc.  Orthodox science recognises  the  importance of  the 
thyroid gland to the health  of  the material body and the 
personality. It is no coincidence that the thyroid is situat­
ed between the heart and the head. 
We  construct a se cond triangle, whose pinnacle is over 
the root of  the nose, level with the cerebellum. This triangle 
acts as a link between our noetical world and our materi­
al body. 
The downward directed triangle, which we construct 
next,  shares the base of  the upward triangles, but its lines 
extend down to meet at the end of  the sternum. Note th  at 
the heart is located in the middle of  this triangle. This tri­
angle  stands  as  the  connection between our psychical 
world and our material body,  and it is through this trian­
gle that we experience a pure and reasoning present-day 
personality. 
The third upright triangle links the shoulder centres to 
a point above our head.  This point,  over our head, con­
nects the fo rmless  noetic state to our material body. Our 
Permanent Personality is within this sacred triangle, just 
above the crown of  our head. 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
Body and Soul 
Begin  with  the  Preliminary Meditation,  page 2 7,  and 
continue ...
Relax  completely ... look at your body  ... see your 
etheric double ... it  is  shining white light.  See the  sky­
blue light in your solar plexus ... see the rosy light in the 
place of your heart  .  .  . and see  the  golden sun in  and 
around your head. See the connections between  your 
three bodies .  .  . all your etheric doubles are  filled with 
life-giving ether. See all God's Glory in you! 
The  two centres above  your shoulders are radiating 
pure white light. Breathe deeply and visualise a straight line 
of pure white light connecting these two centres.  Visualise 
lines of light moving out from these two centres and con­
verging over your thyroid centre  to create  a very low, 
upward directed triangle.  Concentrate on your  thyroid ...
cooperate with the Archangels to  purify your blood.  Feel 
and see their work as they clean your material body ... feel 
the beat of your heart ... this is the voice of the Archangels 
... can you hear them? What is this voice telling you? They 
are speaking of their love for you.  Breathe  deeply ... love 
yourself ... love all other human beings. 
Look again  at the  line of light that extends between 
your shoulders.  From the end-points - the two centres on 
your shoulders  -   two new streams of light move slowly 
upwards.  They meet between your eyes, over your cere­
bellum. Breathe deeply and bring your noetical world into 
harmony with your material body. 
Now, again see the line of  white light  that crosses 
between  the  two centres over your shoulders.  From the 
end-points visualise two  lines moving down over your 
chest and meeting at  the base of  the sternum.  Breathe 
deeply  and bring your psychical world into harmony with 
your material body  .  .  . experience a  pure and reasoning 
present -day personality ... use the mind for right -thinking, 
and the heart  to  express pure emotions.  Through self­
awareness our noetical,  psychical,  and material bodies 
work in perfect harmony and peace.

Once more,  return to the  two centres on your shoul­
ders.  The line between them is  shining in  white light. 
Breathe deeply. From  the two centres streams of light rise 
up  and meet over your head to  form a  fourth triangle. 
Within this glorious triangle, just below the pinnacle,  and 
just above the crown of  your head,  resides your 
Permanent Personality. Breathe deeply. Attune yourself to 
your Permanent Personality  .  .  .    it is as if you are looking 
into a crystal-clear mirror ... see yourself ... see the work 
that your present-day personality has yet to do. 
From above, a  warm beautiful golden light descends ...
it  embraces you .  .  . and covers your bodies.  Breathe 
deeply. Your solar plexus, your heart, and your head are 
radiating golden light ... you have become a golden sun. 
The Throne of Christ  is in your heart.  Go deep into  the 
centre of your beingness ... to the centre of love and cre-
ation.  See and hear Him ... His Will and Power ... His 
Wisdom, Love,  and Life. All of God's worlds are under the 
divine Law of Love.  Breathe deeply. Feel the beats of your 
material heart. Your heart  is the Holy of Holies ... keep 
Him there.  As a present-day personality pray, "0 God,  my 
Father,  make my fo otsteps  upon life's path as  ligh t as  they 
may  be. Let  me  not raise  dust,  in  anger  or greed,  that 
blinds my  brothers and sisters. Make my  steps ligh t upon 
life's path. Make my  heart, 0 God,  my  Father,  a  crystal­
clear mirror to reflect Yo ur Love,  my Love,  and to allow my 
fellow humans to  rejoice. " 
Slowly,  slowly dissolve the  triangles.  Breathe deeply 
and feel your material body: your head ... your heart  .  .  . 
your solar plexus ... your  thighs ... and from your knees 
down to your feet.

Diamond of  Light 
We  are and we exist. As holy monadic Sp irit-Souls we are 
self-conscious  Beings  within  Absolute  Beingness,  never 
separated from our Source. As personalities  we  exist  as 
shadows of  the Real Self  struggling within the worlds  qf 
separation. 
In  many exercises, we seek to connect the present-day 
self with the Soul. Here we  will look, from the peace and 
harmony of  our Sp irit-Soul, at the struggling present-day 
self For although we  know that the Self is a single whole, 
sometimes we feel a great distance between our Soul and 
our present-day  self  This distance is an illusion that we 
can  overcome through introspection,  meditation,  and 
contemplation. Once we have experienced Soul-conscious­
ness we will know who and what we are. 
We  will visualise a number of  three-sided pyramids  in 
connection with the primary centres  of  the head,  heart, 
and solar plexus. Within this diamond-like exercise we are 
able to assimilate with  the pure,  the good,  and the non­
dual, entering into a  higher state of  introspection.

Breathe deeply. In  your solar plexus visualise pure 
light energy  as  a  sky-blue sun.  With your next deep 
breath,  see a  rosy sun radiating from your heart  centre. 
Breathe again and see a golden sun shining in and around 
your head. These three suns overlap, yet they do not mix. 
Breathe deeply. 
With your etheric hands together,  and  out -stretched 
before you,  mark  a point on  the floor. From this point, 
with your left  hand, slowly  draw a  straight line of white 
light along your left  side to a  point behind you.  See, feel

are  now standing in the centre of an equal-sided triangle, 
each side measuring about 10 feet in length. 
Visualise an  upward pointing triangle  on  your right 
side .  .  . another one on  your left  side .  .  . and a  third 
behind you.  Bring  the  three triangles together to form a 
three-sided pyramid.  You are  now in  the middle of  a

pure white light. 
Breathe deeply and visualise three rays of light rising 
from the  centre of the  triangle on  the  floor. .  .   each ray 
goes  to the centre of  one of  the three  walls of  the 
pyramid.  The rays then move,  from wall to wall,  to form 
the base of  a  translucent, upside down,  three-sided 
pyramid.  See sparkling lights moving up and down. 
Focus your attention on your head. From your 
cerebellum  see, hear,  and feel three golden rays of light 
moving downward to  the  corners  of the triangle on the 
floor ... you  have  created  another three-sided pyramid, 
this one of golden light.  Breathe in the golden light of this 
pyramid and let it  clean your thoughts . .  .  "Thine is  the 
Kingdom ... 
Move  to your chest .  .  . from your heart  centre send 
down three rays of rosy light to the corners of the triangle

emotions and desires . .  .  and the Glory .  . . 
Now, concentrate in  your solar plexus. From  this 
centre send down three rays of  sky-blue light to  the 
corners  of the  triangle  on the  floor. Breathe deeply  and 
study  this pyramid filled with sky-blue light .  .  . use the 
light to clean your material body from any illness or pain

in Him, yet you are you ... an individual entity.  Breathe 
deeply and compose yourself in  the  large  pyramid as  a 
present-day personality  and pray: "From the earth  Thou 
didst  sha pe  my  body  and didst give  me a  soul by  Thy 
divine  and quickening  breath.  Thou didst honour the

Controlling Our Powers 
In this exercise we seek to tame the body's primal fo rces. 
For those wishing to lessen the grip of  corporeal cravings, 
as well as fo r those seeking spiritual awakening,  this exer­
cise will help direct and purify  internal  fo rces. 
We  construct a downward pointing triangle,  its base 
resting on the sh  oulders,  with the two sides converging on 
a point over the genitals. From the material perspective this 
triangle symbolises  the  so-called  }a ll  from  grace"  -
enchantment with matter and desires, our apparent sepa­
ration from Absolute Beingness. Yet through the wisdom 
and understanding of  the sp iritual perspective we know 
that the powers invested in the material body can be used 
fo r either good or counter-positive ends. We  are gods,  and 
with  divine autho  rity  we can use  these powers fo r holy 
work. 
Within  the  triangle we  construct a psycho-noetical 
cross, the Christian symbol of  love and reason. We  then 
visualise two snake-like ribbons -  symbolic qf corporeal 
fo rces- rise up  to encircle the cross. The cross can harness 
even wild currents.

Breathe deeply and comfortably.  As  you concentrate 
in the place where you sit,  feel warmth build up in your 
pelvic area. 
Through visualisation, draw a  horizontal line of gold­
en light level with your thyroid.  It extends six inches off 
your sides, just above your shoulders.  From the  two end­
points draw lines down to  a  position over your genitals. 
You have now constructed an  equal-sided triangle point­
ing  downward.  Its  outline is  of golden light.  Take  deep, 
long breaths. 
Within the triangle begin to construct a  cross. Draw a 
vertical line of golden light from just below your thyroid 
extending down to your navel. Across your chest draw a 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
horizontal line slightly above your heart centre.  You have 
created a luminous cross of noeticallight.  Breathe deeply. 
Place your concentration on the  descending triangle. 
You can see it ... you can feel it. Visualise lights of radi­
ant energy six inches off each hip ... on both sides see a 
ribbon of light slowly rise  up ... they  are silvery light ...
they are  like serpents.  Upon reaching the  corners of the 
triangle they lay their heads on your shoulders. 
Breathe deeply ... the  cross on your chest is brilliant. 
Slowly the ribbon on  your left  side moves down from 
your shoulder .  .  .    traces a  line down under the  centre of 
the  cross ... circles up over the  centre of the  cross before 
returning to the left shoulder. Continue to breathe deeply 
and comfortably.  The serpent on  the right side drops 
down over the  centre of the cross .  .  . loops under the 
centre of the cross, before returning to its resting place on 
your right shoulder. 
Your heart  is  radiating golden light ... and  so is  the 
cross ... both are in brilliant golden light.  Breathe calmly 
and, without any fear, hold and caress the serpents'  heads 
with your etheric hands.  They are not snakes,  but rather 
streams of radiation ... manifestations of Divine Wisdom. 
Order them to descend .  .  .  they  are  not to cross the  path 
of the  other .  .  .    slowly they recoil.  They settle and sleep 
beside your hips.  Take very deep breaths. 
See a  shining golden sun in  and around your head. 
Starting from a  point between your eyes move your con­
centration over your nose ... over your lips ... your chin, 
and  down to  the  thyroid. Pause to  feel each part  as you 
move.  Breathe deeply  and return to  the place between 
your eyes ... a  swirling flame begins to rise from there. 
Breathe  deeply and enjoy the  experience, the  sensation, 
the tranquillity,  and the wisdom ... "Tby Will be done." 
Permit the meditation to  continue .  .  . to  unfold. In 
time,  slowly feel your material body: from your head ...
into your chest .  .  . solar plexus .  .  .    your thighs .  .  . and 
from your knees down to your feet. 
"Be ye perfect, as your  Father in 
heaven is perfect" (Matt 5:48).

Tbe Sign of  the Cross 
In this exercise we will create two six-pointed stars. A large 
one will frame our material body,  while a smaller one is 
placed within our body. In the centre of  the smaller star we 
will construct a cross. 
Tbe large   six-pointed star is a most powerfu l protective 
shield against any external intrusions, e.g. negative ele­
mentals,  illnesses,  etc. And there is no greater talisman fo r 
internal protection - protection from the fo es within us -
than the six-pointed star   we construct in our body. 
Tbe cross is  where we will work. Each movement will 
have us  pass through the centre qf the cross, the heart cen­
tre. Tbis is the  centre of Absolute Beingness,  and the Christ 
Logos expressed as Love. As an Orthodox Christian, I con­
struct my  cross by  moving my  hand right to left .  Yo u may 
cross yourself according to your tradition. 
A Living Ta lis1nan 
Begin  with  the  Preliminary Meditation,  page 27, and 
continue ... 
With your etheric hands you will create two six-point­
ed stars,  one within the other,  with a  cross placed in the 
centre. The outlines are of bright golden light, while from 
within the stars of  pure  white,  noetical light radiates. 
Breathe deeply. Begin by drawing a large six-pointed star 
around yourself. For the ascending triangle visualise its 
top  situated about a foot above your head. From the top, 
draw a line on  each side down to two points,  each a foot 
off your hips. See the  base-line of the  triangle level with 
your genitals.  For the triangle facing downward,  visualise 
its  horizontal line level with your thyroid,  extending to 
points six inches off your sides, just above your shoulders. 
From these points,  draw lines of light that converge  over 
your knees. 
Continue to breathe deeply and  now construct within 
your body  the smaller  six-pointed star ... visualise the 
ascending triangle with its top on the cerebellum and the 
lower horizontal line level with your navel,  extending 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
about six  inches off your sides.  The descending triangle 
has its upper horizontal line placed just below the thyroid, 
extending slightly off your shoulders.  From these points, 
above your shoulders,  have lines  descend to  a  point  on 
your genitals. Take deep,  long breaths. 
Within the centre of the inner star begin to construct a 
cross.  Draw  a  vertical  line of  golden light starting just 
below your thyroid,  and extending down to  your navel. 
Across your chest draw  a horizontal line slightly above 
your heart. You  have now created a  cross of  luminous 
golden light. 
Raise your  right etheric hand to  your forehead and, 
addressing  the Almighty, say, "Thine is  the Kingdom ... 
Lower your hand down over your heart, passing over your 
navel, to your genitals,  and regarding the Holy Spirit and 
Its work in Creation, say, and the Power . .  .   Return your 
hand to your heart, and with the Logos and Its expression 
as Joshua the Christ in mind,  say, and the Glory ... Next, 
move your hand to a point over your right lung, and con­
centrating in terms of time and place, say fo rever ... Then 
gently sweep your hand across your chest to a place over 
your left  lung, entering into a  sense of eternity,  continue 
with, and ever .  .  . Placing your etheric hand over your 
heart conclude with, Thy  Will be done. Amen." 
Breathe deeply and relax .  .  . look in your heart  and 
see a  small golden flame.  As  you breathe,  the flame 
climbs upwards through the chest ... through the thyroid 
... and continues up through the  head and out of your 
crown.  Feel the peace .  .  . the understanding .  .  . the 
grace. As the flame rises over your head, petition Absolute 
Beingness to guide you onward,  in strength, wisdom,  and 
love.  Allow the meditation to  unfold. Let the  flame settle 
back into your  heart. Keep the six-pointed stars in  and 
around you,  and let the cross shine forth for protection as 
a  powerful living talisman. 
Breathe deeply and feel your material body  again: 
your head .  .  .    your chest .  .  .    your solar plexus .  .  .    your 
thighs .  .  .  and from your knees down to your feet. 
The cross, within six-pointed 
stars, forms a  powerful talisman.

Our Archangelic Form 
An Incorruptible Body of  Light 
Within God, all Beings are equal and diff er little from one 
another.  Befo re and beyond our expressions in Creation 
we,  along with all other  Beings,  are Holy Monads. From 
our common home, some assume the human fo rm, while 
others join the Archangelic  Orders. In this sense we are 
brothers of  the Archangels. 
When we dress ourselves in the Arch angelic fo rm, our 
higher consciousness will enable us to   better comprehend 
the human experience, become masters of  our homes,  see 
the heav ens within, and perform spiritual work. 
Many people  believe that Archangels  have feathery 
wings that allow them to fly. Tbese wings are actually rays 
of pure energy. In assuming the Arch angelic fo rm, we will 
create these wings. 
Our Archangelic Form 
Begin  with  the  Preliminary Meditation,  page 2 7,   and 
continue ... 
Breathe deeply. With your etheric hands together, and 
out-stretched before you,  mark a   point on the floor. From 
this point, use your left hand to slowly draw a straight line 
of golden light along your left side to a point behind you. 
See, feel  and hear the  light pour from your hand. Now 
with your right hand, construct  an  identical line along 
your right side.  Breathe deeply and visualise the  golden 
light forming a  third line,  which connects the two points 
behind you.  You  are  now standing in  the centre of  an 
equal-sided triangle, each side measuring about 10 feet in 
length.  It is  radiating pure  golden light .  .  . yet the  floor 
remains white. 
Visualise golden flames rising from the  right -side of 
the  triangle on the  floor ... they embrace your right foot 
... come up through the right leg ... and approach the 
solar plexus from the front, where they cross over to the 
left  side of your  body.  See and feel them rise to  the  left 
shoulder and cross over, in  a  straight line, to  the right 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
shoulder. From the  shoulder they spread out and up  as 
three golden rays. 
Now, see golden flames rising from the left-side of the 
triangle on the floor .  .  . they embrace your left  foot .  .  . 
come up  through the left  leg and approach the solar 
plexus from behind ... where they cross over to the right 
side of your body.  See  and feel them rise to  the right 
shoulder and  cross over, in  a  straight line,  to  the left 
shoulder.  From  the shoulder they also spread out  and up 
as three golden rays.  Breathe deeply and comfortably. 
Raise your etheric arms and place them inside these 
golden wings.  Silvery-white light begins to  rise from 
between your feet ... to pass through your genitals ... to 
climb  up the  spine ... and  to go  through the  head and 
out of  your crown to  form a  beautiful lotus flower. 
Breathe deeply. From within the lotus a  silvery-white 
serpent emerges .  .  . and  arches its  head out over your 
forehead. Experience this state. 
Slowly, slowly return to  your human form. Dissolve 
the triangle and pray: "God  of  Life,  Love  and Mercy. 
Enlighten  our minds  to  understand  You  as  the  Truth. 
Clean  our hearts  to  reflect  Your Love  towards  You  and 
towards all other  human beings/ Bless our steps to follow 
Yo ur  Way.  I   know the  gifts  You  gave  me." Compose 
yourself. Breathe deeply and feel your material body: your 
head ... your chest ... abdomen ... thighs .  .  .    and from 
your knees down to your feet.

Gates to the Light 
Churches,  Lamps,  and Stars 
"!see Thy  bridal chamber adorned, 0 my  Saviour, and I
have no  wedding garment that I may enter   there. Make the 
robe of  my  soul to shine, 0 Giver of  Light,  and save me"
(Orthodox Hy mn). 
Many people  seek  the  "golden keys"  without  even 
knowing where the gates are,  or where they may lead. 
In this exercise we are going to approach and perhaps 
even pass  through  the gates. These gates  are  within  us, 
and befo re  we  decide to  cross  through these portals,  we 
should know what we will find on the other side. Are there 
within you peacefu l meadows,  or are there infested jun­
gles? Heavens or hells? So the first work is on the level of  the 
present-day  self,  cleaning our personality qf all negative 
elementals within our subconscious. 
On  the  etheric doubles  of  our three  bodies we  have 
centres of  energy and power, and centres of  consciousness 
and self-realisation. These are gates. On the material body 
we see them as discs, and call them "churches",  where ele­
mentals gather. It is good to know who  is  attending our 
churches.  On  the psychical body we call them  "lamps". 
They   are shaped as spheres. These lamps should be well-
fe d,  burning bright with  the oil of  reason and love.  "Do 
not be  like the fo olish virgins who,  when the Son of  God 
calls at th  e door, have no oil" (Matt. 25: 1-12). On the noet­
ical body you can behold radiant he  avenly "stars ",  stars    in 
need of governors. 
Gates to the Light 
Breathe deeply  and calmly.  Feel your material body. You 
live in this material body. You move this body  and you 
move within it. There is movement even when you relax. 
Concentrate on your toes.  You are  in your toes. Move 
slowly,  slowly up  into your knees.  You feel your knees 
through aesthetic ether. Feel and see your etheric double 
.  .  . breathe deeply and move from your knees up into 
your solar plexus ... concentrate in this centre. With each 

Passing through the Gates to the Light 
breath your solar plexus becomes more luminous in sky­
blue light.  Your solar plexus is a storehouse of energy ...
all kinds of energy ... send out and receive only pure and 
positive energy. Breathe in deeply ... as you exhale allow 
all  fear, doubt, and darkness to  go out of  your body. 
Observe  the movement in this centre  .  .  . study the way 
you are  breathing.  This centre,  on the  etheric double of 
your material body, is in the form of a  disc. Observe  the 
movement of the disc ... light is radiating from within it. 
See the centres in  your material body, symbolically, as 
churches,  churches where elementals congregate .  .  . 
clean your churches. 
Leave your solar plexus and  move  up  into your chest. 
Breathe  deeply and visualise  rosy light in  the place of 
your heart ... silence your emotions and your desires and 
keep only love  in your heart:  real love  for yourself, for 
others and for life.  Study this radiant centre.  What do you 
see here,  a sphere  or  a  disc? Now you see a  sphere 
because you  are in  the  etheric double of your psychical 
body. Observe  the pattern of your breath.   The centres of 
your psychical body  are like lamps ... "Let your light so 
shine before men" (Matt. 
5:  16). Again,  feel your heart cen­
tre.  On your material body  it is a  disc, and on your psy­
chical body  a sphere.   Observe the movement and the 
light of the disc and see the luminosity of the sphere. 
Move from your heart  centre slowly up  into your 
head.  Visualise a  golden sun  in and around your head. 
Breathe deeply and free your thoughts.  See all  your cen­
tres at once .  .  .    with your etheric eyes look at your mate­
rial body and its centres of churches ... see your psychi-
cal body aglow with lamps ... and now behold the  cen-
tres on your noetical body  ... they are  also shaped as 
spheres, but far brighter ... like radiant stars. 
Visualise a  pyramid around you  .  .  . it is full of white 
light.  You  are  standing in the  middle of a  pyramid that is 
three times your size.  As  you look around you see four 
gates,  one on each side of the pyramid.  Each gate leads to 
a  different aspect of the light.  The gate  in  front of you is
Churches, lamps  and stars . 
"Lift  up your  heads, 0 ye gates;
and be ye lift  up, ye everlasting 
doors; and the King of glory 
shall come in" (Ps. 24:7).

of golden light .  .  . the one on your right side is  of red 
light ... the one on the left of violet light ... and the one 
behind you of sky-blue light.  The floor is filled with a  sil­
very-white mist. Breathe deeply ... feel the energy of the 
Archangels .  .  . and see their work in  all  your  bodies. 
When you feel perfect harmony  prevailing throughout 
your three bodies .  .  . when you feel  you are  master of 
your bodies,  you may approach the gates. 
Turn first to your right  and take three careful steps for­
ward ... observe your breathing.  You are  standing before 
the  gate of Michael.  Gently bow in  reverence until  only 
your head and chest have passed through the red light ...
remain there for a few moments, enjoy the experience, and 
then take three steps back to  the centre of the  pyramid. 
Face the golden triangle. Turn now to your left  and take 
three steps forward.  As  you bow to  Raphael,  your  head 
and chest enter his gate of violet light.  Remain there for a 
few moments  and  then return to the  centre.  Turn around, 
take three steps towards the back of the pyramid.  Bow 
before Gabriel and  have your head and chest enter the 
sky-blue gate.  Remain there for a few moments before you 
return to the centre of the pyramid to face the golden gate. 
Look into the  golden light .  .  . Absolute Beingness, 
Christ Logos and  the Holy  Spirit.  Take three gentle steps 
forward .  .  . bend your head, and enter the  golden light 
... this is  the  Ocean, of which I  am a  drop.  I   have the 
right to  become one with the  Ocean any time I  wish.  At 
the same time I can be separate ... and be a drop. We  are 
never alone.  Can you hear the  Beloved Joshua? Observe 
yourself as He speaks to you .  .  . He teaches you on all 
levels . .  .   "I  am the door:  by  me if any man enter in, he 
shall be sa  ved,  and shall go in   and out,  and find pasture" 
Qohn 10:9
). 
Step back into the  middle of the  pyramid, fold your 
hands over your chest. Slowly balance your bodies .  .  . 
your noetical,  your psychical,  and material bodies are 
one.  When you are  ready, dissolve  the  pyramid.  Breathe 
deeply and feel your material body again.

BEINGNESS, GOD, THE 
ALMIGHTY, THE FATHER 
The all encompassing Godhead. 
Beings within the One Being. 
What we know of God we see 
only  in reflection, as evident 
both externally and internally. 
Love,  Light  and Life belong to 
the primary Nature of Absolute 
Beingness as Total Love, Total 
Wisdom and Almightiness. The 
Love of God is universal, cease­
less, and unconditional. It is the 
Love of God, expressed as 
Grace, which lies at the core of 
Creation. The Light  is pure, 
luminous Super Self-conscious­
ness. Everlasting Life is the 
eternal motion, generation and 
regeneration of Creation. 
Absolute Beingness is Omni­
presence, Omnipotence, and 
Omniscience. Its characteristics 
include Multiplicity, Self-suffi­
ciency, and the Will-pleasure  to 
express Itself in Itself as 
Creation. Absolute Beingness 
manifests Itself as the Christ 
Logos and the Holy Spirit, 'and 
these three are one' (1 John 
5:7). 
ABSOLUTE BE-NE
S
S 
That aspect of God which lies 
absolutely beyond the reach of

the fathomless and inarticulate 
depths of the Divine that are

hath seen God at any time' (1 
John 4:12). 
ARCHANGELIC MAN 
Archangelic Man is an archetype 
belonging to the Archangelic 
Orders. A Holy Monadic emana­
tion passes through the Idea of 
Archangelic Man on its way to 
the Idea of Heavenly Man. For 
this reason human beings are 
brothers of the Archangels. 
72 
ARCHANGELS, ANGELS 
Archangels are logoic and holy 
spiritual Beings who build, main­
tain, and grace the universes. 
Within Absolute Beingness are 
Orders of Archangels, each 
Order containing myriad upon 
myriad of Beings of the same 
kind. We know of twelve Arch­
angelic Orders: Thrones, 
Authorities, Dominions, 
Principalities, Overlords, Sera­
phims, Cherubims and others, 
named and unnamed. They 
possess Total  Wisdom, Love, 
Power, and Absolute Self-aware­
ness.  Angels are elementals of 
the Archangels. 
ARCHETYPES

Also see CAUSES and IDEAS 
AT-ONE-MENT 
The Super Self-conscious state 
in which a being merges into 
complete unity with any other 
being or existence, and with 
Absolute Beingness in Theosis, 
without ever abandoning its 
Self-conscious Ego. 
ATTUNEMENT 
Adjusting our vibrations to the 
frequency of any other existence 
or being, to the extent that we 
can observe and study its 
nature. Attunement is reached 
prior to at-one-ment. 
BEING and EXISTING 
Being is our Divine Nature, 
boundless and eternal Spirit. 
Existing, as a projection of 
Being, is within the boundaries 
of time-place-space. An exis­
tence is a temporal phenomenon 
with a beginning and an end. 
CAUSAL STATES 
Above the noetic state, the 
causal states are non-dual 
conditions of pure Love, Causes, 
Laws, and Principles, cared for 
by the higher echelons of the 
Archangelic Orders. They are the 
fifth heaven and above. 
CAUSE AND EFFECT, LAW OF 
The Law of Cause and Effect is 
recognised by scientists as well 
as mystics. This Divine Law of 
growth, harmony and balance, 
requires action to result in reac­
tion. Every deed, thought, and 
emotion has a consequence, 
either favourable or detrimental. 
Karma, a term from the East, is 
the accumulation of the 'effects'. 
This Law can operate over sev­
eral lifetimes as well as within 
much shorter periods of time. 
CAUSES and IDEAS 
Absolute Be-ness is the primal 
Cause. The Will-pleasure of 
Absolute Beingness is the Cause 
of Creation. From within the Will­
pleasure of Absolute Beingness, 
all subordinate causes spring. 
Causes shape archetypal Ideas, 
which in turn give rise to noetic 
forms. Archangels work through 
the Ideas and apply Total 
Wisdom to each form. Every 
Idea holds within it the whole 
Circle of Possibility and Prob­
abilities of the form to be mani­
fested. 
CHRIST LOGOS 
The Logos, the Divine Common 
Selfhood, is Absolute Beingness 
manifested as Super Self-con­
sciousness. Logos has been 
translated from the Greek to 
mean 'Word'. 'In the beginning 
[authority] was the Word, and the 
Word was with God, and the 
Word was God' (John 1:1). The 
Logos is 'the real light which 
enlightens every man ... coming 
into the world' (John 1 :9). Joshua 
Emmanuel speaks as the Christ 
Logos when he says, 'I  am the 
Son of God'  (Matt. 27:43),  and as 
a humanbeing when He speaks 

as the 'Son of man' (Matt.18:11). 
Joshua is  a direct and pure Ray 
of the Logos incarnated, by 
immaculate conception, in 
Palestine twenty centuries ago. 
His Divine Teachings, as pre­
served in the New Testament, 
are cherished in our work as uni­
versal and timeless, offering 
indispensable guidance in the 
exaltation of consciousness. 
CIRCLE OF POSSIBILITY 
Each form contains a Principle 
known as the Circle of 
Possibility. This Principle delin­
eates, with Total Wisdom, the 
expressions of all phenomena of 
life. All manifested forms  are 
continually developing: from 
seed to tree,  from child to adult. 
Life requires change, movement, 
so that experience may be gath­
ered from the many perspectives 
of a Circle. Each form changes 
in appearance, though never in 
essence as the Circle of Possi­
bilities are immutable in the 
Eternal Now. No form can 
escape its Circle of Possibility, 
thus ruling out transmigration 
from one form to another (e.g. 
humans will always reincarnate 
as humans). 
CIRCLE OF PROBABILITIES 
While a Circle of Possibility is 
inescapable, the Principle of its 
Circle of Probabilities allows for 
a vast array of occurrences. For 
man is free to choose the course 
of his life, a seed may or may not 
germinate, and a young tree may 
become diseased and die. Within 
each Circle of Possibility, we 
find millions of probabilities. 
COMMON SELFHOOD 
As present-day personalities, we 
may come into confl ict  with one 
another and the gulf  between us 
may seem great, but in our com­
mon logoic consciousness we 
are unified and indivisible. This is 
what Joshua Emmanuel the 
Christ taught when He said, 'Ye 
shall know that I  am  in my 
Father,  and ye in  me,  and I  in 
you' (John 14:20),  and 'I am the 
vine, ye are the branches' (John 
15:5). 
COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS, 
COSMIC MEMORY 
In the Cosmic Consciousness 
every event, past and present, 
in  all the universes, is recorded 
and preserved. The Cosmic 
Consciousness is constructed 
of Mind by means of living 
elementals in the Eternal Now. 
Within the Cosmic Conscious­
ness is the Cosmic Memory 
(also known as the Akashic 
Record). This is the 'heavenly 
archive' where impressions, 
actions, thoughts, emotions, 
and desires are chronicled. By 
attuning himself to the Cosmic 
Consciousness a mystic can -
within the limits of his own 
development -enter and study 
the Cosmic Memory. 
CREATION 
Manifestation of Absolute 
Beingness in  Itself as the 
universes, from the highest 
heavens to the worlds of exis­
tence. All of Creation is in accor­
dance with Its Divine Plan, under 
the care of the Holy Spirit and 
Christ Logos. 
DIVINE MEDITATION 
Divine Meditation, for lack of a 
better term,  is believed to be the 
state prior to Creation, in which 
Absolute Beingness contem­
plates expressing Itself within 
Itself. However, there is the 
'divine paradox' that there has 
never been a time when there 
was no Creation. 
DIVINE PLAN 
The blueprint of Creation, 
perfect and complete, account-
Glossary 
ing for everything and for all 
occurrences. Attuning ourselves 
to the most wise Divine Plan of 
Absolute Beingness is the pur­
pose of our existence. 
ECSTASY 
Entering the Kingdom of 
Heavens through expansion, 
attunement and at-one-ment. 
Ecstasy is of the Spirit as it 
implies a passing beyond all 
conceptual thinking and the 
confines of time and place. 
EGO and EGOISM 
Our use of these terms is not to 
be confused with contemporary 
psychological terminology. 
Egoism misuses Mind through 
the construction of selfish 
desires and base emotions, like 
greed, malice, and envy. The 
Ego (capital E) is the Self as 
Being, our Self-aware Soul, and 
is reflected in a reasoning and 
loving personality. Egoism is the 
sum-total  of all self-centred, 
unbridled elementals and the 
source of dis-ease in Man, the 
nation, and the world. Our Ego 
nature brings forth love, 
compassion, reasoned thinking 
and reasoned action. 
ELEMENTALS 
Every thought, emotion, and 
desire  -both conscious and 
subconscious -creates and 
transmits an elemental, a 
thought-form, that  carries on 
an existence of its own. We 
create and regenerate two types 
of elementals. When negative 
emotion prevails over thought, 
we have created emotional 
thought-forms, or desire­
thoughts. When our ideas,

Gates to the Light 
(when no longer fed with etheric 
vitality). Elementals of a kind 
collect to form powerful group 
elementals. If an individual, or a 
collection of individuals, are 
vibrating at a certain frequency, 
they will attract such elementals. 
Archangels also create elemen­
tals in the service of the Divine 
Plan (e.g. angels and nature 
spirits). 
ETERNAL NOW, ETERNAL 
PRESENT 
Time and place are concepts 
resulting from, and sustained 
by, impressions generated in 
the worlds of separation. These 
concepts,  and the respective 
experience, vary from one 
dimension to the next. The 
worlds of existence are con­
tained within the higher heavens 
of the Eternal Present. The expe­
riences we have in the worlds of 
existence are but a slice from 
the larger whole, the state of 
Everlasting Life,  where past, 
present,  and future collapse into 
the Eternal Now. 
ETHEREAL WORLD 
The etheric double of the planet. 
ETHERIC CENTRES 
Centres of energy (Sanskrit: 
chakras) located at various 
points on the etheric doubles of 
our bodies. These centres act 
as gates and storehouses for 
elementals. Each of the three 
bodies, from the gross material 
to the more refined, displays 
these centres on  its etheric dou­
ble: 'stars' shine on the noetical 
body, 'lamps' light the psychical 
body, and 'churches' sanctify 
the material body. 
ETHERIC DOUBLES 
All manifested forms, from the 
simplest to the most complex 
structures, possess an etheric 
double, centred in the body and 
74 
extending slightly beyond it. The 
etheric doubles, both perfect and 
incorruptible, serve as the moulds 
for a body's construction and for 
the preservation of a body's 
health. Within etheric doubles 
etheric vitality is received and 
distributed to various parts of the 
body. An etheric double exists 
as long as a body (whether mate­
rial, psychical or noetical) is 
projected. When a body passes­
over (dies), its etheric double 
dissolves. 
ETHERIC VITALITY, MIND 
VITALITY 
'Our daily bread', etheric vitality 
(Mind at certain frequencies) is 
obtained from the sun, breathing, 
meditation, food, and rest. We 
swim in a sea of etheric vitality 
which surrounds and permeates 
the globe, giving life and nourish­
ment to all phenomena. 
ETHERS 
Within the etheric doubles we 
find etheric vitality in four condi­
tions: as the creative, imprint, 
sensate, and kinetic ethers. 
Creative ether is used in the 
construction and maintenance of 
all phenomena of  life. Imprint 
ether is used to shape etheric 
vitality into psycho-noetical 
images. Sensate ether is the 
'feeling giving' ether, and kinetic 
ether facilitates motion. 
EXISTING 
see BEING and EXISTING 
EXOSOMATOSIS (E�woo�m6atc;)
A Greek word equivalent to the 
English expression 'out of body'. 
We know of a first (from the 
material body), a second (from 
the psychical body) and a third 
(from the noetical body) exoso­
matosis. We all leave our bodies 
at night, during sleep, and travel 
to other planes subconsciously. 
The aim, however, is to be 
self-conscious while out of body. 
FAITH 
Not only a theoretical belief 
in  the dogmatic truths of a reli­
gion, but an all-embracing 
relationship, a recognition of, 
and love for Absolute Being­
ness. Faith, above all, is an 
active virtue for 'faith without 
works is dead ... '  (James 3:26). 
FORMS and ARCHETYPES 
Anything, in order to exist, needs 
a form. All phenomena 
of life are rooted in causal Ideas 
and patterned on noetic forms. 
There are billions of archetypal 
forms reflected in the worlds 
of existence. Each form possess­
es a unique Circle of Possibility 
which demarcates its expres­
sion. Under the care of the Holy 
Spirit, the Archangels work 
through the forms to create and 
sustain the phenomena of life.

GUARDIAN ARCHANGEL 
At the point of our original 
incarnation, having passed 
through the Human. Idea, each of 
us  is accompanied and protect­
ed by a Guardian Archangel. 
Throughout  our sojourn into the 
worlds of separation, our 
Archangel helps our Permanent 
Personality plan each incarnation 
-
without ever interfering with 
our free will. This Archangel, with 
whom we are egofied, is of the 
Order of the Thrones. 

HEAVENLY MAN 
Also called the Idea of Man or 
the Human Idea. Our bodies are 
constructed according to the 
Causal Law of the heavenly 
human form. 
HOLY MONAD, HOLY 
MONADIC SELF 
Our real  identity as Spirit-Ego­
Beings. A Holy Monad might  be 
thought  of as one of countless 
myriads of 'cells' within the 
Multiplicity and Self-sufficiency 
of Absolute Beingness. 
HOLY SPIRIT 
The dynamic aspect of Absolute 
Beingness as Total Wisdom 
and Almightiness. The Holy 
Spirit is impersonal Super­
consciousness that expresses 
the Omnipotence of Absolute 
Being ness. It allows for the 
creation and preservation of the 
universes. We experience the 
Holy Spirit as universal Wisdom 
and Healing Force.

INDIVIDUATION 
see INDIVIDUATED SELFHOOD 
INDIVIDUATED SELFHOOD 
Individuated Selfhood encom­
passes all the expressions of the 
self from its source as a Holy 
Monad, fi ltered down to the 
petty present-day personality. 
Within the Selfhood, not a single 
expression is devalued; each is 
cherished in its own right. Our 
Spirit-Ego-Being partakes in the 
Will-pleasure of Absolute 
Beingness (to express Itself in 
Itself) by expressing Itself within 
Its own Selfhood. 
INNER SELF 
A term indicating the Self-aware 
Soul in Its projection as the 
Permanent Personality. 
INTROSPECTION 
An inner exploration to trace the 
sources of our behaviour with 
the resolve to self-consciously 
structure our personality and 
its subconscious. The aim of 
introspection is to free the self 
of the limitations of egoism, by 
releasing 'your conscience from 
dead works' (Hebr. 9:14). Daily 
introspection, also termed 'look­
ing within', is the process of 
self-examination, of 'knowing 
thyself'.  This is the core practice 
of every Researcher of Truth and 
all those interested in Self­
Realisation.

MEDITATION 
The inner reaches of introspec­
tion become the outer reaches 
of meditation, as the exploration 
moves beyond the subjective 
experience of the present-day 
personality, into the boundless 
ocean of Mind, towards the 
universal  and eternal. 
MERCY and GRACE, DIVINE 
Most compassionate, mysteri­
ous and litt le understood forces 
in Creation, Divine Mercy and 
Grace permit the miraculous to 
occur -the seeming exceptions 
to the Law of Cause and Effect. 
It is by the Grace of God that we 
are embodied, entrusted with 
the gift of free will. And it is the 
Glossary 
Mercy of God that 'maketh his 
sun to rise on the evil and on the 
good, and sendeth rain on the 
just and on the unjust' (Matt. 
5:45).  For as James wrote in his 
epistle, 'mercy rejoiceth against 
judgement' (3:13). 
MIND 
The bearer of life.  Everything 
that  exists is made of Mind at 
varying frequencies from super­
substance, substance, to solid 
matter. Mind is not  God, but an 
emanation of Absolute Being­
ness imbued with the Total 
Wisdom, Love, Power, and Purity 
of its Creator. Mind is divine at 
its source and holy in its expres­
sion. When the word 'mind' is 
used to express its everyday 
meanings, it appears with 'm' in 
the lower case . 
MIND-LIGHT 
see MIND 
MULTIPLICITY, DIVINE 
Absolute Beingness in Its mani­
fold nature as gods within God. 
The entire diversity of Life 
resides within God, in 'the full­
ness of him that fi l leth all in all' 
(Eph. 1 :23). 
NOETIC STATE 
A  state linking the worlds of 
separation to the causal states, 
where forms are unexpressed in 
the Eternal Now. From the noetic 
state, the Archangels derive the 
forms to create and sustain the 
phenomena of life. This state is 
where we possibly may come to 
rest between incarnations. 
NOETICAL WORLD, NOETICAL 
BODY 
The five-dimensional world, and 
the most  rarefied of the three 
worlds of separation. In  the 
noetical world is the  world  of 
thought  and home of the noeti­
cal body. Here the Total Wisdom 
75 

Gates to the Light 
of Absolute Beingness finds 
expression in the worlds of dual­
ity as manifested forms, ranging 
from galaxies to unicellular 
organisms, all constructed of 
Mind super-substance. This is a 
world of seven planes, each with 
seven sub-planes. 
OBSERVATION 
Observation is part of our divine 
nature. Attention without ten­
sion. Perfect concentration. The 
ability to observe in detail, and 
to recall what we have observed, 
is vital to our comprehension of 
Life. 
PASSING-OVER 
A euphemism for what is com­
monly termed 'dying'. Passing­
over is properly understood as 
an episode within a Circle of 
Possibility where  a personality 
concludes its existence in one 
dimension only to continue in 
other worlds. Death is not an 
end, but a beginning, a birth into 
another dimension. 
PERMANENT ATOM 
That part of  the Permanent 
Personality which records the 
experiences and lessons it has 
received in space-place-time. 
The permanent atom is situated 
in each body simultaneously, 
and registers emotions, 
thoughts, reactions, and experi­
ences as they occur in the 
worlds of existence. 
PERMANENT PERSONALITY 
The active aspect of the  Self­
aware Soul, both within and 
beyond the worlds of separation. 
The Permanent Personality filters 
present-day personality  is  a pro­
jection of the Permanent 
Personality into the worlds of 
separation. This petty self, infat­
uated with knowledge resulting 
from the five senses, is the sum­
total  of its elementals. The work 
of the present-day personality is 
to cultivate a humble, moral, and 
loving character. 
PRINCIPLES and LAWS, DIVINE 
Divine Principles and Laws 
govern all expression in time, 
place and space. They are the 
basic structure of the Divine 
Plan, keeping all worlds and 
universes in balance and order. 
It is our recognition of, and 
alignment with,  these Laws (e.g. 
of Cause and Effect, of 
Harmony, of Order, of Growth 
and of Love)  and Principles (e.g. 
Circles of Possibility and Prob­
abilities) which  lead to enhanced 
spiritual development. Also see 
CAUSES and IDEAS. 
PSYCHICAL WORLD, 
PSYCHICAL BODY 
The four-dimensional world, 
also known as the 'world of 
emotions'. Our psychical body is 
composed of a mixture of our 
conscious and sub-conscious 
emotions and desires, some 
helpful, others harmful. The 
super-sensuous psychical 
world, home of our psychical 
body, is divided into seven 
planes, and  each in seven sub­
planes. It is to the psychical 
worlds that we travel in first 
exosomatosis, in our psychical 
body, and to which, on passing­
over, we first go. 
knowledge to the present-day 
PSYCHO-NOETICAL 
personality and distills wisdom. 
The relationship between the 
PRESENT-DAY PERSONALITY 
A personality developed during 
each incarnation, which we 
may call 'George' or 'Mary'.  The 
7
6 
psychical world of emotions and 
the noetical world of thoughts is 
so interwoven that we have to 
consider them as semi-unified. 
There is scarcely a thought with-
out some emotion, and in every 
emotion there is a measure of 
thought. 
PSYCHO-NOETICAL IMAGES 
Multi-dimensional images of 
psycho-noetical substance, 
formed through visualisation by 
means of noetic light. Once 
formed, these elementals are 
everlasting, as are all elemen­
tals. 
PSYCHO-THE RAPY 
Esoteric Christian psycho­
therapy encompasses a com­
plete range of healing. Not  limit­
ed to treating problems within 
the personality, a true psycho­
therapist  is concerned with 
noetical, psychical and physical 
health. An aspiring psychothera­
pist  must train himself in many 
respects: the conscious use of 
etheric vitality (in the four states 
of ether}, visualisation, the com­
prehensive knowledge of human 
anatomy (including the etheric 
doubles}, the understanding of 
the subconsciousness, and 
awareness of Divine Laws. A 
psycho-therapist's effectiveness 
in healing depends on the purity 
of his heart  and consciousness. 
He must not  consider himself a 
'healer', but  rather a worthy con­
duit for the Holy Spirit. 
Compassion, concern, under­
standing and above all, love are 
his values. He considers his 
patients Spirit-Soul-Egos, in the 
Common Selfhood, with time­
place-space difficulties. 
SELF-AWARENESS 
A state of conscious awareness 
of the Self within the Divine Plan. 
Through work and will-power, 
we awake from the slumber of 
everyday consciousness into a 
state of expanded Self-aware­
ness. 

SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, SUPER 
SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 
Consciousness, in varying 
degrees, of ourselves as individ­
uated Beings and existences. 
Through faithful  introspection 
we become fi rst self-conscious, 
and later Super Self-conscious -
totally aware of Beingness and 
existence. 
SELF-REALISATION 
Full awareness of who and what 
we really are. Self-Realisation 
is attained when the present-
day personality is transmuted 
into the Permanent  Personality, 
and unified with the Self-aware 
Soul. 
SELF-SUFFICIENCY, DIVINE 
A characteristic of Absolute 
Beingness: complete Abund­
ance,Biessedness,andindepen­
dence of all needs. 
SOUL, SELF-AWARE 
A ray of a Holy Monad that 
passed through the Idea of 
Heavenly Man. The Soul is not 
created;  it is  the precious 'pearl' 
of Spirit (cf. Matt. 13:45, 46). 
The incorruptible Soul, which 
St. Paul called the 'Spiritual 
Body' (1 Cor. 15:44),  is in a 
formless state as Spirit, 
containing the Idea of man. 
When returning to the Godhead, 
the Soul marries the Spirit-Ego­
Being in a state of Super 
Self-consciousness. 
SPIRIT -EGO-BEING 
Our Self as a Divine Being: 
boundless, eternal, and immov­
able. Our Spirit-Ego-Being is the 
Self as Holy Monad, Super Self­
conscious, in at-one-ment with 
the Almighty. The Will of our 
Spirit-Ego-Being to express 
Itself in Its own Selfhood derives 
from the Will-pleasure of 
Absolute Beingness to express 
Itself within Itself. 
SUBCONSCIOUS 
Researchers of Truth under­
stand the triadic nature  of the 
subconscious. One chamber, 
so to speak, of the subconscious 
contains all the elementals com­
posing our personality. Another 
chamber serves as the store­
house of life-giving etheric vitali­
ty. The most valuable chamber is 
that of the Logos and the Holy 
Spirit. 
SYSTEM FOR THE RESEARCH 
OF TRUTH 
Our system of esoteric Christ­
ianity recognises the eternal 
truths known to all great reli­
gious traditions, while firmly 
based in the teachings of the 
God-Man Joshua Emmanuel 
the Christ  and the New Test­
ament. Through directed study, 
exercises and meditations, we 
seek the balanced evolution 
and integration of our entire 
being, as we cultivate our moral, 
ethical, spiritual, and mystical 
aspects. Our approach is meth­
odical, safe, and self-evident. 
THEOSIS 
At-one-ment with the One God, 
Absolute Beingness. The 
moment when the Prodigal Son, 
now Super Self-conscious, 
returns home to his most  loving 
Father. 
TOTAL LOVE, WISDOM and 
POWER 
Primary natures of Absolute 
Beingness and all Beings. They 
form  a sacred triangle, each 
nature complementing the other. 
VISUALISATION 
Visualisation is a language of 
the divine, the 'key' (Rev. 3:7) 
to the kingdoms. After learning 
to observe carefully and to 
concentrate fully, we gain the 
ability to visualise consciously. 
We use etheric vitality to create 
Glossary 
elementals, from psycho-noetical 
images to entire scenes. 
Through visualisation, in healing 
work, we learn to materialise and 
dematerialise. Visualisation is the 
process of harnessing thought  in 
a constructive manner. 
WILL-PLEASURE 
God's pleasure in creative­
ness; Absolute Beingness 
expressing Itself in Itself as 
Creation. Will-pleasure, in 
Greek evareskeia (Euag£mma),
carries a sense of pleasure 
derived from bountiful giving, 
as practiced by a warm,  gener­
ous and wealthy source. 
WORLDS OF SEPARATION, 
WORLDS OF DUALITY 
The three worlds of existence 
(material, psychical and noetical) 
in which we spend periods of 
seeming separation from 
Absolute Beingness. These are 
worlds of duality, of time-space­
place, which we experience dur­
ing each incarnation.
